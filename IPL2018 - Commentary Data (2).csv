18.1,"Brathwaite to Rayudu, no run","yorker on off, and dug away to the square-leg fielder"
17.6,"Kaul to Watson, no run","full just outside off, and defended towards cover point. We'll have to wait."
17.5,"Kaul to Watson, FOUR runs","full just outside off, and this time it's been caressed! The last one was brute force but this was pure timing. Proper front-foot straight drive past the bowler"
17.4,"Kaul to Watson, FOUR runs","full on middle, but Watson makes some extra room and then drills it past the bowler. Kaul's lucky that he got out of the delivery's way. Smokes this to the long-off boundary"

16.6,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR runs",dropped just in front of Hooda at deep backward square! And then it bounces away to the boundary. A horror evening for Hooda. It was a full ball on middle that Watson had slog swept to the leg side
16.5,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR runs","full on off, but Watson's picked the wrong'un. Goes down on one knee, and then ramps it past the keeper's left. He's doing this in style!"

16.3,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","full outside off, and defended with soft hands to cover. They take the single and that's an IPL hundred for Watson The first IPL finals hundred while chasing, the second in all IPL finals. Take a bow, legend. Also his second of the season"
16.2,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","full just outside off, and driven with the turn to long off. Gets Watson back on strike and the crowd's gone ballistic"
16.1,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","full on off, but it's not spinning. Watson drives it past the non-striker to long on. Moves to 99"
15.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, 1 run","back of a length on off, and Watson fends it off the back foot. Comes off the bat's outside edge and runs down to third man"

15.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, SIX runs","short ball, and it's the offcutter too, but Rayudu picks the length early. Comes dancing down the wicket and then slaps it inside out over long off. Ambati's done waiting"

14.5,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","ripper! Full outisde off and it's the wrong'un once again. Hits his front pad, but looks like impact is outside off. The appeal for lbw is turned down as well but Rashid has convinced his captain to review. Missing everything"

14.3,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","extra bounce! Short on off, and turning into the batsman again. Whipped off his hips to short fine leg"

14.1,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","full on off, and defended towards the leg side. Goswami scampers across to stop the single"
13.6,"Brathwaite to Watson, SIX runs","slower ball outside off, and that's in Watto's arc. Stands tall and pulls this over deep midwicket. What a show from Watto. Ninety-seven runs"
13.6,"Brathwaite to Watson, 1 wide","yorker on leg stump, and going down the leg side. Watson does well to skip away from the ball's line"
13.5,"Brathwaite to Watson, FOUR runs","chops it past short third man for another boundary! Moves on to the nineties It was angling into the batsman, but he did really well to open his bat's face"
13.4,"Brathwaite to Rayudu, 1 run","good length outside off, and Rayudu opens his bat's face to run this down to Bhuvi at third man"
13.3,"Brathwaite to Raina, OUT","goes short! Brathwaite's appealing for the caught behind, and Williamson reviews. It was a quick delivery that rose onto Raina. Raina misses the pull, and the ball brushes his top glove. Raina's walking even before the third umpire gives his decision. Rayudu's already made his way out"
13.2,"Brathwaite to Watson, 1 run","length ball on middle, but Watson mistimes his pull. Played along the ground to sweeper on the leg side"
13.1,"Brathwaite to Raina, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and cramps Raina for space. But still he manages to clip it off his hips to deep backward square"
12.6,"Sandeep to Watson, FOUR runs","overpitched just outside off, but luck's going Watto's way! Steers it between gully and point, and the over ends with a boundary. Twenty-seven runs off the over!"
12.6,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 wide","wide outside off, but he's got to bowl this again. Over the tramlines "
12.5,"Sandeep to Watson, SIX runs","hat-trick of sixes! Length ball outside off, and Watson opens his stance to go towards the leg side. Drags this from outside off and slaps it over long on once again"
12.4,"Sandeep to Watson, SIX runs","misses the yorker again, and Watson sends this over cow corner! Low full toss on middle, but Watson gets his front leg out of the way and deposits this into the stands. Delightful hitting"
12.3,"Sandeep to Watson, SIX runs","goes short outside off, and Watson simply checks his pull shot. Doesn't matter. It comes off the bat's bottom half, but the shot soars over long on! How powerful is this man. Replays show that the knuckle ball just didn't come off"
12.2,"Sandeep to Watson, FOUR runs","low full toss outside off, and this time Watson drives it over extra cover. Off the bat's toe end, but still finds the gap past wide long off. Sharma misses the yorker-length, and is punished by Watto on this occasion"
12.1,"Sandeep to Watson, no run","wide yorker outside off. Watson tries to steer it square, but can't get bat to ball. An excellent start for the bowling side"
11.6,"Brathwaite to Watson, 1 run","slower ball to end the over. It's wide outside off, so Watson is forced to reach at it. Flat-bats it past the bowler's left, and takes a single to keep the strike"
11.5,"Brathwaite to Watson, FOUR runs","slower ball on off, but it's always angling into Watson. He attempts to pull, and despite it not coming off the bat's middle, the shot has enough behind it for the ball to race away to the square-leg boundary"
11.4,"Brathwaite to Raina, 1 run","back of a length on middle, but angling into Raina. He backs away to make some room, but can only chop it down to short third man"
11.3,"Brathwaite to Watson, 1 run","attempts to cut it late, but he can only steer it to short third man. Watson's halfway down the wicket, so the fielder has a shy at the stumps. He misses, and now that allows CSK to take the run after all. Bhuvi the guilty man, and Brathwaite's not pleased one bit"
11.2,"Brathwaite to Raina, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, but he's taken the pace off the ball. Raina walks inside the line of the ball, and nudges it to the vacant area on the leg side"
11.1,"Brathwaite to Watson, 1 run","angling into his pads, and clipped away to deep midwicket. Gets Raina back on strike"
10.6,"Shakib to Raina, SIX runs","full on middle, and that's been lifted over long on! Leans into this, and times it beautifully over the fielder on the boundary"
10.5,"Shakib to Watson, 1 run","wide outside off, and allows Watson to free his arms. Slaps a cut to Rashid Khan at sweeper cover"
10.4,"Shakib to Raina, 1 run",muscles this pull down the ground. Was a length ball outside off. Long on cleans up
10.3,"Shakib to Raina, no run","length ball on off, and Raina has the luxury to go onto the back foot. Punched to mid on"
10.2,"Shakib to Watson, 1 run","wide outside off, and that's been cut off the back foot. Goes to the sweeper at deep point"
10.1,"Shakib to Watson, SIX runs","flat outside leg stump, and Watson goes down on one knee and thumps it over deep backward square leg! What a classy way to get to your fifty. A freebie to start his spell"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Raina, FOUR runs","flat down leg, errant line. Just a bit of bat on Raina's sweep and the ball races away to the fine leg boundary."
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","picks the googly, maybe on line. Short and wide, he goes back and pulls to deep midwicket"
9.4,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 1 run","another googly, punched to deep midwicket. CSK very happy with this."
9.3,"Rashid Khan to Raina, no run","the googly around off, pushed to Rashid's left. He gets across acrobatically and throws back to the keeper too."
9.2,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","a googly outside off, driven to long-off"
9.1,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 1 run","flat and straight, worked to deep midwicket for a run"
8.6,"Kaul to Watson, 2 runs","just over cover! Wanted to always go over but didn't quite time that. A slower ball outside off, chipped over the fielder"
8.5,"Kaul to Watson, FOUR runs","knew that was his area. 115 kph, a knuckle ball outside off. Watson knows the fielder is up so just slaps the ball over the fielder. Lands just inside."
8.4,"Kaul to Watson, 2 runs","he goes for the catch! Good effort. A low full toss is hit away to the sweeper cover. Rashid runs in, decides to go for the catch and nearly gets there. He gets body behind ball, as my cricket coach used to say, and stops it from going past."
8.3,"Kaul to Watson, SIX runs","clears long-on. Another knuckle ball outside off, Watson looks to muscle that over midwicket but he can only splice it. Such is the power of Watson that it clears the fielder easily."
8.2,"Kaul to Raina, 1 run","good length on middle and leg, a wristy flick to deep square leg, on the bounce."
8.1,"Kaul to Watson, 1 run","a nice slower ball on middle, a knuckle ball. Chipped to long-on for a run. Should have been two there."
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","a wide googly outside off, turning in. Pushed to cover."
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 1 run","the flat legbreak, worked to midwicket"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 leg bye","92 kph, the googly on middle and leg. Watson misses a flick, going down? A muted appeal is rejected."
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 1 run","a googly down leg, worked down to short fine leg for a quick single"
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","the wide legbreak outside off, drilled down to long-off for one"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Watson, no run","the legbreak to start outside off, punched back to the bowler"
6.6,"Kaul to Raina, FOUR runs","that's rubbish. Short and waaay down leg, flicked away down to the fine leg boundary again. Almost went for six. His lines were awful. 16 off that."
6.5,"Kaul to Raina, no run","good length on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
6.4,"Kaul to Raina, FOUR runs","poor bowling. Drops short down leg, pulled down to the fine leg boundary. The fielder is far too square, which means that's a terrible delivery."
6.3,"Kaul to Watson, 1 run","lands safe! Full outside off, Watson wants to hit straight, his preferred hitting range against seam. But the ball skews over point. Rashid runs in from sweeper cover and can only collect on the bounce"
6.2,"Kaul to Watson, SIX runs","it's Watson's bread and butter. On the pads and Kaul just nonchalantly flicks that over square leg. That's just a flick, people. Wow."
6.1,"Kaul to Raina, 1 run","full outside off, driven to long-on with a wristy whip. Some pressure on CSK."
5.6,"Sandeep to Raina, 1 run","back of a length outside off, pushed to Hooda at point."
5.5,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 run","a slower ball down leg, Watson misses a slog. Raina steals a leg bye, but Sandeep kicks the ball onto the stumps. Raina's full-length dive saves him. That's the commitment you want to see in an IPL final"
5.4,"Sandeep to Watson, FOUR runs","130 kph, too straight and Watson smashes it right back. Full and in the arc. Watson can't quite get underneath it but can get enough power. Thwack past mid-off"
5.3,"Sandeep to Watson, SIX runs","catch that Rashid, says Watson. Full and straight, it's like Watson was waiting for that. Not even that short but he heaves it away, T20 style over midwicket. Way into the stands."
5.2,"Sandeep to Raina, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, 113 kph, sliced to point. A diving save again"
5.1,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 run","picks that length, rocks back and pulls on the bounce to deep midwicket. Rashid ""can do anything"" Khan just plucks the ball with one hand. And says so what? Watson lets out an expletive. Can't quite say what was here."
5.1,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 wide",the knuckle ball goes wrong. Full and waaaay down leg
4.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, 1 run","full on off and middle, worked to deep midwicket. 3-1-9-0 for Bhuvi. He'll be back later."
4.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Raina, 1 run",flicked away uppishly to deep square leg for a run.
4.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Raina, no run","131 kph, good length on off, blocked back. This has been special from  Bhuvneshwar. Interesting move from KW to keep him going too."
4.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Raina, no run","on a length outside off, 139 kph, inside-edged into the pad. Raina wants one. Watson says he can't make it."
4.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, 1 run","drifts down leg, worked to square leg for a run. Now 6 off 14"
4.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Raina, 1 run","full and straight, worked down to backward square leg"
3.6,"Sandeep to du Plessis, OUT","beautiful bowling. Watson's pressure results in the wicket of du Plessis. He charges down, but it's the slower knuckle ball. Faf does not pick that. As a result, he goes through with the lofted drive and the ball goes straight up instead of far back. Sandeep says I got this to his team-mates. He's got it."
3.5,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 run","slogged away with bad timing to deep midwicket. Full and straight, heaved away"
3.4,"Sandeep to Watson, no run","back to normalcy. Back of a length outside off, guided to backward point. Hooda doesn't throw this time."
3.3,"Sandeep to Watson, FOUR runs","131 kph, smashed for four. Overpitched around off, and drilled past the bowler. Can't bowl that length"
3.2,"Sandeep to Watson, no run","that's closer! But still sliding. A knuckle ball down leg, Watson looks to slog sweep but misses. Struck on the pad, but going down. 0 off 10"
3.1,"Sandeep to du Plessis, 1 leg bye","a slower ball down leg, off the pad towards backward point. A big appeal as the ball misses bat and strikes pad, but not out."
2.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","good length outside off, 140 kph. Another slapped punch to point. Watson is 0 off 9"
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, 5 runs","breaks that streak! And it's five. Bhuvneshwar has the right to be seething. Good length outside off, dabbed to backward point for a run. Hooda runs in and throws unnecessarily at the batsman's end. No back-up. FIVE."
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run","make that 10! Back of a length outside off, 119 kph, pushed to cover"
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run","awesome bowling. Some nervous cheers from the crowd. Good length and straight, defended back. NINE DOTS."
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run","back of a length on middle and leg, 129 kph, pushed back to the bowler. SOOO many dots to begin."
2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run","good length outside off, away movement. Guided to point"
1.6,"Sandeep to Watson, no run","full and straight, 126 kph. Another push to mid-on. Watson is now 0 off 8"
1.5,"Sandeep to Watson, no run","full and straight, 129 kph. Excellent delivery because it keeps the pressure on Watson. Defended"
1.4,"Sandeep to du Plessis, 1 run","full and straight, wobbly through the air, pushed to mid-off for a single."
1.3,"Sandeep to du Plessis, no run","full outside off, 129 kph, a leaden-footed drive to cover"
1.2,"Sandeep to du Plessis, FOUR runs","that's width and CSK's first runs of the chase. Back of a length and a tad wide, carved away through cover. A slapped carve"
1.1,"Sandeep to du Plessis, no run","a gentle loosener to stand. Full and swinging back in, defended by Faf"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","maiden to start! Second of the match! Another beauty, back of a length, pitches and deviates away to leave Watson hanging."
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","short and wide outside off, slashed away to backward point. Five dots. Pressure on Watson."
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","good stop. 133 kph, full and wide outside off. Dabbed towards backward point. Hooda runs to his left and stops a run with a dive."
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","well bowled. Back of a length outside off, the ball comes back in this time. That's Bhuvi's strength. Defended awkwardly."
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","full and wide outside off, more away movement. Left alone"
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","beauty to start! Back of a length outside off, the ball pitches and moves away like a snake. Beats the bat."
19.6,"Thakur to Brathwaite, OUT","Holes out but Sunrisers finish on 178 for 6. Short outside off again, and he tries to pull it towards the leg side. off the bat's toe end, and caught easily by Rayudu. Who's got the momentum at the break?"
19.5,"Thakur to Brathwaite, SIX runs","flat-batted over long on! He's not even hit it well, but Brathwaite's so powerful that the ball soars over Rayudu. It was short, and Brathwaite clearly hadn't timed it well, but hey, welcome to T20 cricket"
19.4,"Thakur to Brathwaite, no run","slower ball on the fourth-stump line, and Brathwaite misses! Gold dust. Brathwaite swings blindly towards the leg side, but he's through with his shot way too early"
19.3,"Thakur to Pathan, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, and that's been mistimed to long off. Was in his arc, but just couldn't get his bat under the delivery"
19.2,"Thakur to Pathan, no run","back of a length outside off, and Yusuf tries to pull it square. It comes off the bat's toe end, so the delivery goes nowhere. Brathwaite, however, wants to steal a run, but Yusuf's not interested. Shardul chooses not to have an aim at the stumps"
19.2,"Thakur to Pathan, 1 wide","that's all over the place! Short on middle, and angling down the leg side. Signs of frustration on Dhoni's face"
19.1,"Thakur to Pathan, 2 runs","low full toss on leg stump, and that's been nudged to deep midwicket. Brathwaite pushes his partner to return for the second"
18.6,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, SIX runs","finally connects, and that's a biggie! Loopy delivery wide outside off, and Brathwaite waits for this delivery. Gets his front leg out of the way, and then smashes it over Rayudu at long on. A good way for SRH to end the over"
18.5,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, no run","swing and a miss! It's the slower ball, but he drops the length short. Brathwaite attempts a leg-side slog, but he's through his shot way too early"
18.4,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, no run","tries to be cheeky, but that doesn't come off! Length ball on off, and Brathwaite walks inside the delivery's line to paddle it over short fine leg. Can't connect at all though"
18.3,"Ngidi to Pathan, 1 run","back of a length on off, and Yusuf's cramped for space. All he can do is punch it towards short cover for a single"
18.2,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, 1 run","in the air for a long time once again, but lands safe! Full on middle stump, and Brathwaite's leg-side slog comes off the bat's toe end. It falls just in front of long on"
18.1,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, no run","first strike! Back of a length on middle, and angling into Ricky. He tries to drive it straight over Ngidi, but plays it down the wrong line. The ball goes over the top of leg stump and through to Dhoni"
17.6,"Bravo to Pathan, FOUR runs","ends his spell with the offcutter, but Yusuf flat-bats it over the umpire for four! Rayudu at long on tries his best to cut it off, but he's just a bit too slow. Dhoni's not pleased"
17.5,"Bravo to Brathwaite, 1 run","short on off, and Brathwaite mistimes his pull. It's in the air for ages, but the ball lands between deep midwicket and long on. Bravo's not happy. I think he had started celebrating as soon as the ball went in the air "
17.4,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 run","length ball outside off, and Yusuf slaps it to point. They need to hurry for the single, but the fielder chooses not to throw at the stumps"
17.3,"Bravo to Brathwaite, 1 run","deft, but well stopped by backward point. It was a yorker on off, and Brathwaite did well to steer it behind square. Good effort inside the circle"
17.2,"Bravo to Brathwaite, SIX runs","full outside off, and that's been walloped! In Brathwaite's arc, and he smashes it over Bravo's head"
17.2,"Bravo to Brathwaite, 1 wide","brilliant yorker on leg stump, but oh that's cruel! It goes down the leg side as Brathwaite skips his toes out of the way. Wide called by umpire Erasmus"
17.1,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 run","full on off, and that's been driven past the bowler's left. Man at long off though"
17.1,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 wide","slower ball, but going down the leg side. The batsman did move towards the off side, but Bravo was just a bit too wide"
16.6,"Ngidi to Hooda, OUT","full outside off, and he tries to slog it towards midwicket. He's through his shot too early and the shot's been dragged to deep square leg. Deceived completely by the (lack of) pace. Taken by Shorey"
16.5,"Ngidi to Pathan, 1 run","length ball on of, and angling into the batsman. Turned off his pads to square leg and gets Hooda back on strike"
16.4,"Ngidi to Pathan, SIX runs","muscled over long on! Sheer power. Back of a length outside off, and Yusuf simple pulls it over the non-striker's head. Stand-and-deliver stuff"
16.3,"Ngidi to Hooda, 1 run","short outside off, and he attempts to steer it fine. Plays it fine, but can't beat Bravo at third man"
16.2,"Ngidi to Pathan, 1 run","full outside off, and he tries to drive it over cover. Comes off the bat's outside edge, and flies down to third man"
16.1,"Ngidi to Hooda, 1 run","chipped over midwicket! Lands safe. It was a short-ish ball on off, and the batsman was rather surprised. Checks his leg-side clip, and eventually lifts it towards the leg side"
15.6,"Bravo to Hooda, 1 run","full on leg stump, and that's been whipped off his pads to deep backward square. Off the mark"
15.5,"Bravo to Shakib, OUT","full toss outside off, and that's been struck straight to Raina at cover! Bravo's going to feel very lucky. Shakib did hit it well, but Raina's a beast in the field. Time out as Hooda makes his way out"
15.4,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 run","offcutter outside off, and Yusuf punches it to the vacant short cover region. He calls nice and early for the single"
15.3,"Bravo to Shakib, 1 run","lands on middle, and Shakib wants to send this to deep midwicket. Slogs hard at it, but mistimes it to the sweeper on the leg side"
15.2,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 run","full on off, and angling into his pads. Yusuf loses his balance as he tries to clip it off his pads. Mistimed to square leg this time"
15.1,"Bravo to Pathan, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, but Yusuf stands tall, rides the bounce, and then cuts it in front of cover! Slapped with disdain"
14.6,"Karn to Shakib, no run","sliding defense from Shakib! Full on off, and he came down the ground to drive at it. Checks his shot at the last moment, but his feet go sliding. Looked rather uncomfortable. Hope he hasn't overstretched his hamstring"
14.5,"Karn to Shakib, 2 runs","width offered outside off, and that's been comfortably cut to deep point. They jog back for the second run. Bad throw from the deep, so the batsmen contemplate taking a third, but eventually choose not to"
14.4,"Karn to Shakib, no run","big heave, but Shakib misses it completely! Flighted outside leg, and it's the topspinner this time"
14.3,"Karn to Pathan, 1 run","full on leg stump, and Yusuf whips it down the ground to wide long-on"
14.2,"Karn to Pathan, SIX runs","wide outside off again, but this time Yusuf's done waiting. Big stride forward, and then extends his arms to lift it over extra cover! Ridiculous"
14.1,"Karn to Pathan, no run","full outside off, and turning further away. Yusuf checks his shot thinking it'll be a wide, but the umpire says that's fine"
13.6,"Thakur to Pathan, 1 run","short, but Yusuf manages to pull this over midwicket. Comfortably played infact, and he'll keep the strike"
13.5,"Thakur to Shakib, 1 run","slashed away to third man this time. Length ball on middle, and Shakib attempted that cut once again. Came off the bat's thick edge"
13.4,"Thakur to Pathan, 1 run","slower ball, and pitching on middle. Tapped off the back foot past the non-striker to long on for a walking single"
13.3,"Thakur to Pathan, FOUR runs","wide outside off, and that's been slapped past point! Deep point huffs and puffs, but has no chance in cutting it off. Allows Yusuf to free his arms, and the big man doesn't disappoint"
13.2,"Thakur to Shakib, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and Shakib chops this cut to third man. It was too close to his body for that shot to be played perfectly"
13.1,"Thakur to Pathan, 1 run","full outside off, and he drives this straight over the umpire. Hit well, but too well. That means it's only a single as long on cuts it off"
12.6,"Karn to Pathan, 1 run","full on middle, and turning away from Yusuf. He taps it off the front foot towards short cover and calls for a quick single"
12.5,"Karn to Pathan, no run","tries the cut, but it's too full for it. Was wide outside off, but Yusuf can't connect"
12.4,"Karn to Pathan, 2 runs","short on middle, but spinning across Yusuf's body. He pulls it - along the ground - to the region near deep midwicket. Big strides allow him to come back for the second"
12.3,"Karn to Pathan, FOUR runs","steered past first slip! Nice effort by Ngidi in the deep, but he just failed to parry it back. It was a length ball outside off, and Yusuf used Karn's pace to place it well"
12.2,"Karn to Pathan, no run","length ball outside off, and zipping straight through. Pathan rocks back, and cuts this from very close to his body"
12.1,"Karn to Williamson, OUT","legspinner's dream ball! Sweeeet. Full, but wide outside off, and KW couldn't pick the line. He came shimmying down the wicket trying to play it big, but the ball drifts away from the batsman, lands near the tramlines, and then Dhoni does the rest. A rare pre-meditated shot attempted by Williamson"
11.6,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run","good length on off, and KW taps it off the back foot. Plays it past Shakib's left to long on, and he calls early for the run"
11.5,"Bravo to Shakib, 1 run","slipped? Full toss on middle, but not of the pace that would worry the batsman. Nudged off his pads to the vacant midwicket region for a single"
11.4,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run","full outside off, and Williamson connects with the drive once again. But Faf's on the 30-yard circle, prepared for that very shot"
11.3,"Bravo to Williamson, FOUR runs","slower ball outside off, but way too slow. KW goes deep into his crease, winds up big, and then smashes this pull through the midwicket region"
11.2,"Bravo to Williamson, FOUR runs","full on off, and that's been creamed! Gets his front leg out of the way, and drives it beautifully. Finds the gap between deep point and extra cover"
11.1,"Bravo to Williamson, no run","length ball on off, and angling into his body. Tucks it towards midwicket off the back foot"
10.6,"Jadeja to Shakib, FOUR runs","full outside off again, and Shakib goes for the leg-side slog once again. Not timed as well, but still has behind this shot to send it to the wide long-on boundary. Seventeen off the over"
10.5,"Jadeja to Shakib, SIX runs","massive! Is this Shakib's night? Tossed up outside off, and Shakib's quick to get down on one knee, and thumps it over cow corner. Uff"
10.4,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 leg bye","quicker ball on leg stump and going down leg. KW tries to sweep, but changes his shot late. Hits his front leg, but impact outside leg"
10.3,"Jadeja to Williamson, FOUR runs","drops just short of gully! And the ball then goes through for a boundary. Heart-in-mouth stuff. Flights it just a bit extra this time, and KW tries to drive. Comes off the bat's outside half, and slices it to the off side"
10.2,"Jadeja to Shakib, 1 run","good length on off stump, and he smothers it with the turn. Played off his pads to square leg"
10.1,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","full on leg stump, and defended towards cover point with the bat's open face"
9.6,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run","full and straight, flicked away towards long-on. Jadeja prevents two. 4-0-25-0, very tidy."
9.5,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","a short and wide delivery outside off, Williamson misses an attempted upper cut."
9.4,"Chahar to Shakib, 1 run","good length on off, worked to square leg, 133 kph"
9.3,"Chahar to Shakib, no run","good length outside off, comes back in with that around-the-wicket angle. Chopped to Bravo at backward point."
9.2,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run","a slower ball down leg, worked to deep midwicket, 109 kph"
9.1,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","short outside off, pulled to midwicket. Mostly toe-ended."
8.6,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","flat and straight, worked to square leg for one"
8.5,"Jadeja to Shakib, 1 run","shortish and wide again, cut to the deep point fielder"
8.4,"Jadeja to Shakib, FOUR runs","excellently played. Short and wide, spinning in. Shakib cuts towards short third man. Watson labours down, in slow motion, to his left. Allows the ball to go through"
8.3,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, OUT","the wild slog and Jadeja strikes! Flat and straight, as anticipated, Dhawan looks to slog sweep that over midwicket but he doesn't make contact. The ball beats the slog, clips the thigh pad and then knocks into the stumps. That'll slow Sunrisers down. Again, the first over after a time-out."
8.2,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","some flight on middle, Williamson makes room and chips the ball to long-off for one"
8.1,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","slow outside off, pushed to long-on for one."
7.6,"Bravo to Williamson, SIX runs","that's filth from Bravo. A slower ball down leg, a full toss as well. Williamson just swivels on a sweep and clears short fine leg. The catch is taken, but by a ballboy outside the boundary."
7.5,"Bravo to Williamson, FOUR runs","picks the slower ball outside off, full and wide. Williamson gets underneath the length and lofts the ball cleanly over cover for four."
7.4,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","a very slow slower ball on off, pushed in front of point for one"
7.3,"Bravo to S Dhawan, no run","132 kph, another good delivery. Using the bouncer well this time, short and down leg. Dhawan looks to pull,  but misses. Bravo and Dhoni appeal, Bravo more vociferously. No glove."
7.2,"Bravo to S Dhawan, no run","excellent bowling. The wide yorker outside off, the ball creeps under Dhawan's shot."
7.1,"Bravo to S Dhawan, no run","a slower ball outside off, drilled to cover"
6.6,"Karn to S Dhawan, 1 run","looked for six, didn't get it. Some flight on middle and leg, swivel-heaved away to long-on"
6.5,"Karn to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","slog-swept into the gap at square leg. Some flight but the line isn't great. Heaved away to deep square leg, finds the gap"
6.4,"Karn to S Dhawan, no run","the googly, lots of flight on that. Driven back to the bowler"
6.4,"Karn to S Dhawan, 1 wide","strays down leg, wide."
6.3,"Karn to Williamson, 1 run","83 kph, misfield from Raina. Full outside off, KW comes down and pushes to Raina's left. He lets the ball through, slightly hurried by the pace of the ball"
6.2,"Karn to S Dhawan, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut away to backward point for a run. A good start from Karn"
6.1,"Karn to Williamson, 1 run","flat and straight, worked away to wide long-on, but for one. Faf is too quick."
5.6,"Thakur to Williamson, 1 run","well played, well bowled. Short and wide, a dab to third man for a run"
5.5,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run","much much better. Good length on off, but because he's got all those runs, this is a good result for Sunrisers. Tip and run to cover"
5.4,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 2 runs","too straight this time, down leg and flicked away nonchalantly through square leg for two. Good stop by Karn, running to his right from fine leg."
5.3,"Thakur to S Dhawan, SIX runs","in the slot and outta here! Full and straight, Dhawan sees that early and whacks the ball easily over long-on. That's not a bad line, but awful length with a batsman under pressure."
5.2,"Thakur to S Dhawan, no run","nicely driven but finds Jadeja at cover. Full and wide, driven elegantly"
5.1,"Thakur to Williamson, 1 run","another typical single from KW. 135 kph, full on off, tapped with soft hands into the off side. That's such an important T20 stroke, converts a good ball into a single."
5.1,"Thakur to Williamson, 1 wide",starts with a wide down leg.
4.6,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run","charges down but gets a slower ball outside off, chopped to mid-off"
4.5,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","smashed on the midriff! Back of a length on middle and leg, Williamson misses a pull, and winces almost as the ball makes contact with his body"
4.5,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 wide","thinks of carving the ball over the keeper, but withdraws from the shot late and wisely. A bouncer is way over the head of Williamson."
4.4,"Chahar to Williamson, FOUR runs","that's tripe. What was that? 114 kph, a slower ball, that's okay. But it's short too. Williamson waits and waits and pulls through square leg."
4.3,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","good length outside off, dabbed towards cover for nothing"
4.2,"Chahar to Williamson, SIX runs","the top-edged pull waaaay over fine leg. Short on middle and leg, Williamson looks to pull, but gets a thick leading edge which flies over the fielder."
4.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","now comes the ugly slog. Good length on middle and leg, a wild swing from Dhawan. Inside-edged into the pad for one."
3.6,"Ngidi to Williamson, no run","maiden over! In the fourth over! That's a very unusual result for Williamson and T20s, at this point of an innings. An overpitched delivery is caressed to cover for nothing."
3.5,"Ngidi to Williamson, no run","142 kph. Now five dots! Back of a length and wider outside off, Williamson now goes cutting but misses. Pressure now on KW and Sunrisers."
3.4,"Ngidi to Williamson, no run","139 kph, excellent bowling. Now using the width of the crease, goes wider, full and moving back in. Pushed to mid-on for nothing."
3.3,"Ngidi to Williamson, no run","THREE DOTS! Full again outside off, pushed to cover. Not exactly the T20 way, to bat so cautiously in the Powerplay."
3.2,"Ngidi to Williamson, no run","full outside off, no swing. Skewed away off the outside half to point. Two dots."
3.1,"Ngidi to Williamson, no run","full on off, Williamson has shuffled across so far, like he usually does in white-ball cricket. Pushed to mid-on"
2.6,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","126 kph, just about medium pace but it's very tight. Back of a length on off, pushed back."
2.5,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run","fuller than a good length outside off. Some swing. But it's very well played, soft hands, a dab to point for one"
2.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","shortish, but on leg. Worked down to fine leg for a run"
2.3,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","nicely bowled. Full and swinging in, worked to midwicket. Absolutely no room for Dhawan. Surely a plan?"
2.2,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run","lovely shot. Backward point takes some pace off the ball by getting a hand on it. Short and wide, slashed towards backward point's left. Third man cleans up."
2.1,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","too short! Back of a length outside off, Williamson drags a pull to midwicket"
1.6,"Ngidi to Williamson, 1 run","full on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on for a tight, but well-judged single."
1.5,"Ngidi to Goswami, 1 run, OUT","that same line and length. And a terribly-judged second from Goswami! CSK's first wicket. Worked away towards backward square leg. Fine leg gets across quickly, he's holding the ball by the time Goswami turns around. Dhawan looks at his partner mid-way through and knows that's an iffy call, but trusts his partner. Maybe, he shouldn't have. Dhoni takes off the bails with Goswami well short."
1.4,"Ngidi to S Dhawan, 1 run","full on leg, 143 kph. Beaten for pace again. Struck on the pad, the ball then ricochets away for one towards point."
1.3,"Ngidi to S Dhawan, no run","142 kph. A LEAVE! I saw that earlier today at Lord's, didn't think I would tonight. Back of a length outside off, Dhawan lets that go."
1.2,"Ngidi to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","that's wayward. Back of a length down leg, nudged down towards fine leg for two. Karn gets across to his left and cuts the ball off, but was his back leg touching the boundary? Looks like that. Yep, that's four. Good call."
1.1,"Ngidi to Goswami, 1 run","some pace? 137 kph, back of a length down leg, hurries Goswami. A thick inside edge onto the thigh and then towards point."
0.6,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","good length outside off, 134 kph, carved to backward point. Decent comeback from Chahar."
0.5,"Chahar to Goswami, 1 run","shortish and wide, a bit of width. Cut down to third man for a single."
0.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length outside off, moving away. Tapped to backward point for a good single. The kind of single Dhawan likes to take with Rohit for India."
0.3,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","good length delivery outside off, punched away to backward point"
0.2,"Chahar to Goswami, 1 run","back of a length down leg, some swing yes. Worked away down to fine leg for a run."
0.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","swings in from around the wicket, full and straight. Smashed to long-on, on the bounce!"
0.1,"Chahar to Goswami, (no ball) 1 run","no-ball first up! That's nerves, that's jitters. The ball slips out, a high full toss outside off is over the waist. Carved to third man. Dhoni thinks it's below the waist."
19.6,"Brathwaite to Kuldeep, no run","drilled down to long-off, but it doesn't matter.  SRH have arrested a four-match losing streak  and will play Chennai Super Kings in Sunday's final.  KKR's campaign has come to a shuddering halt "
19.5,"Brathwaite to Kuldeep, no run","walks across to paddle fine, but misses. It's all but over now."
19.4,"Brathwaite to Kuldeep, no run","right into the blockhole outside off, dug back. He goes for the catch but he took it on the bounce."
19.3,"Brathwaite to Gill, OUT","he's picked out Rashid at deep midwicket! Oh, dear. Surely that's the end of KKR's hopes? This was hit well, but he got more elevation than distance. Swirling in the air, Rashid came in from the ropes and then took it well with his palms facing upwards. Brathwaite's decision of going around the stumps to cramp the batsmen for room has worked so far. Is that the final nail in KKR's coffin?"
19.2,"Brathwaite to Shivam Mavi, OUT","he's whipped this straight to Rashid at deep midwicket. Wasn't far from clearing the ropes, right intent. Just the execution was a little off. Mavi backed away, got under the delivery and hit it well. Rashid was on the move to his left, kept his composure and took this. The crucial thing from KKR's point of view is Shubman Gill will be on strike."
19.1,"Brathwaite to Shivam Mavi, FOUR runs","sliced over backward point, one bounce into the ropes. Poor from Carlos, bowls too full and straight. Enough pace for Mavi to work with"
18.6,"Kaul to Gill, SIX runs",he's cleared the ropes! Uses the depth of the crease to get under the length and belt this over wide long-off. This is magnificent. The match is alive.
18.5,"Kaul to Gill, 2 runs","lofted over the infield, but Williamson, running back from cover, can't get there. They scamper back for the second"
18.4,"Kaul to Shivam Mavi, 1 run","carved to sweeper cover, SRH won't mind the singles."
18.3,"Kaul to Gill, 1 run",walks across and whips this full toss on the bounce to deep midwicket
18.2,"Kaul to Shivam Mavi, 1 run","another ripper of a yorker, squeezed to cover but they chance a run. Williamson misses a direct hit at the striker's end. Gill would've been walking back had that hit. Had three stumps to aim at"
18.1,"Kaul to Chawla, OUT","the off stump has been flattened! Chawla went to wallop this over long-off, swung through early, missed it and heard the death rattle. Cross-seam delivery this from Kaul, landed just a touch ahead of length. Chawla didn't get anywhere close to that. KKR right on the edge."
17.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, FOUR runs"," belted back, Bhuvi gets a hand, but it will be cruel to call that a chance!  Deflects this to the boundary. So hard was that hit by Gill. Much-needed for KKR."
17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Chawla, 1 run",paddled but can't beat the fine leg fielder.
17.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, 1 run","angles this full delivery into the base of leg stump to cramp Gill, who works this to deep midwicket"
17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Chawla, 1 run","third yorker in a row, Chawla toe-ends this back towards the bowler, Bhuvi can't stop it cleanly on his followthrough, parries this to mid-off"
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, 1 run","superb yorker-length ball, looks to muscle this over long-on, but can't get underneath the length, down to the fielder for a single"
17.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Chawla, 1 run","right into the blockhole, Chawla squeezes this towards backward point as they scamper a run"
16.6,"Kaul to Chawla, 1 run","can't get hold of a juicy full toss, mistimes this to deep midwicket"
16.5,"Kaul to Gill, 1 run","another superb yorker that tailed in late towards middle, squeezed to sweeper cover"
16.4,"Kaul to Gill, no run","yorker-length on off, squeezed to Williamson at cover"
16.3,"Kaul to Chawla, 1 run","hit back past Kaul but there's no timing, they'll scamper a single"
16.2,"Kaul to Chawla, no run","looks to arch back and help this over the keeper to third man, misses."
16.1,"Kaul to Gill, 1 run",whips this full delivery on the pads to deep midwicket
15.6,"Ahmed to Chawla, SIX runs","he's hit this into his hometown Moradabad! Remember the shot! Full and angling in full, Chawla had decided he'll heave this come hell or high water, got enough bat on it. Wild hit, way over deep midwicket."
15.6,"Ahmed to Chawla, 1 wide","slips this full delivery way down leg, good take by Saha. Wide called and rightly so"
15.5,"Ahmed to Gill, 1 run","slower length ball on middle, punched to Dhawan at deep cover"
15.4,"Ahmed to Gill, FOUR runs","slapped away to the cover boundary! Angles this in from around the stumps, Gill makes room and punches this past a diving Williamson"
15.3,"Ahmed to Chawla, 1 run",steers this gently towards third man to get off the mark off his fourth delivery
15.2,"Ahmed to Chawla, no run",angles back in from wide of the crease to skid in and hit Chawla on the pads as he looks to work this to the leg side
15.1,"Ahmed to Gill, 1 run","slices this down to square third man, good work by Kaul. A sliding stop"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Chawla, no run",defends this length ball on middle with soft hands
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Chawla, no run","sharp turn, comes back in to beat the inside edge and hit him on the pad"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Russell, OUT","they've prised him out with the googly! Big, big wicket. He's off on a victory lap. Dhawan at a wide slip takes a smart catch. This is a googly that comes back in from length outside off, he goes for a hard cut shot but gets a thick outside edge. Dhawan's reflexes simply superb."
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Russell, no run","fizzing legbreak that he lands at length, defended from the crease."
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Russell, no run","dabs this gently into the off side, towards short third man"
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run",crunching cover drive to the sweeper
13.6,"Shakib to Russell, no run","did that take the edge? Yes! Russell played down the wrong line, the ball drifted in, he played outside the line. Lobbed off the pad as Saha fluffed it as he went for the catch.  Tough chance, big inside edge onto pad "
13.5,"Shakib to Gill, 1 run","punched to midwicket where there's a misfield by a diving Dhawan, some hesitation as well but they complete the run"
13.4,"Shakib to Gill, 2 runs","cut away very nicely, into the gap between backward point and short third man. Couple for Gill"
13.3,"Shakib to Gill, no run","turns this indrifter into the leg side, Shakib runs across to stop that"
13.2,"Shakib to Russell, 1 run","deceived in flight,  just manages to chip this over Shakib.  That would've sent a few shivers down the KKR dugout"
13.1,"Shakib to Gill, 1 run",punches this through the line to sweeper cover
12.6,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run","works this with the spin to deep midwicket. Picked the googly nicely there, did Gill"
12.5,"Rashid Khan to Russell, 1 run",right to the pitch of the ball as he eases the drive to deep point
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run",punched down to long on as he jogs the single
12.3,"Rashid Khan to Russell, 1 run",dabs this googly into the leg side to get off the mark
12.2,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, OUT","goes for another sweep, this time the umpire raises the finger. Rashid sets off on a victory lap! Huge moment in the match. Shapes to sweep, this is a length ball that spins back in to beat the sweep and hit him in front of middle and leg."
12.1,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, no run"," fifth successive sweep  he's played off Rashid. Not controlled, on the bounce to square leg"
11.6,"Shakib to Karthik, OUT"," there's the key wicket  and he can't remain unbeaten tonight, though. This is superb from Shakib. Gets the ball to drift back in a long way from around the stumps, skid through to cramp Karthik for room as he shaped to cut. This didn't turn and took the underedge onto the stumps."
11.5,"Shakib to Lynn, 1 run","punched on the up past Shakib, to long-off"
11.4,"Shakib to Lynn, no run","chipped, but lands short of Williamson at cover."
11.3,"Shakib to Karthik, 1 run",steps out and works this with the angle towards deep midwicket

10.6,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 1 run","another short ball, this skidded through, doesn't get hold of the pull, down to deep midwcket"
10.5,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, FOUR runs","picks the length early, rocks back to open up the leg side and hammers this to bisect deep midwicket and long-on. Super stroke.  Half-tracker, a very rare one from Rashid "
10.4,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","swept with the spin this time, much finer to Kaul at fine leg"
10.3,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, FOUR runs","ferocious sweep, beats square leg. Fetched this from length outside off and picked the bones out of that. Controlled it very nicely"
10.2,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 1 run","googly that spins back in sharply, Karthik gets a thick inside edge towards backward square. Don't think he picked it"
10.1,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, OUT","Oh, Uthappa! What have you done? Why would you want to reverse sweep the opposition's best bowler who can turn it a mile? Played too early, the ball drifted into middle and leg and flattened the leg stump."
9.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, FOUR runs","back of a length and outside off, slower ball, Lynn jabs at it early and sends a thick outside edge between backward point and short third man. If ever, you needed proof this game is KKR's"
9.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, 1 run","realising slip has been pulled out now, Uthappa opens the face and secures a single down to third man"
9.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run","back of a length and outside off, punched to covers off the front foot"
9.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run","on a length and wider outside off, Uthappa stabs at it but the outside edge does not carry to Dhawan at wide slip"
9.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run","on a length and outside off, Uthappa lets the ball slide off the face to point"
9.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run","just short of a good length and angling in from over the wicket, punched back to the right of Bhuvneshwar"

8.5,"Shakib to Uthappa, 1 run","arrowed into the pads, whipped off the back foot through midwicket"
8.4,"Shakib to Uthappa, no run","full and slides in from round the wicket, defended to the leg side off the back foot"
8.3,"Shakib to Rana, 1 run, OUT","worked off the pads through midwicket. Rashid runs in from the deep, gathers the ball cleanly, and throws it to keeper. Saha does the rest. Rana chances a second. He slips after completing the first, still goes for the second, dishes out a desperate dive, but is caught short. The second wasn't on after the tumble. Fine throw from Rashid"
8.2,"Shakib to Rana, FOUR runs","pushed through on middle, Rana rolls out the reverse-sweep and hits it between backward point and short third man for four"

7.3,"Brathwaite to Lynn, FOUR runs","short and wide, Lynn throws his bat at ball and carves it up and over short third man"
7.2,"Brathwaite to Rana, 1 run","back of a length on middle, tip and run to short midwicket, where Williamson swoops down the ball. There's a mix-up between the wickets but Williamson can't throw the stumps down at the bowler's end. Run-out chance missed"
7.1,"Brathwaite to Lynn, 1 run","back of a length on off, dabbed to the right of backward point"
6.6,"Rashid Khan to Rana, 2 runs","tossed up outside off, driven in the air but past the outstretched right hand of Rashid"

6.2,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","full on off, Lynn rolls out another sweep, this is hit along the ground to long leg"
6.1,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, no run","Rashid belts out an appeal for leg before. Umpire Nitin Menon calls it not out. Rashid chats with Saha and asks for a review. Pushed through on middle, skids off the pitch, and looks like Lynn has tickled the ball with the glove as he shapes to sweep. Ultra Edge detects a spike"
5.6,"Kaul to Lynn, 1 run","full-toss on middle, 140ks, backs away and splices it to the left of a diving Brathwaite at mid-off"

3.2,"Kaul to Narine, OUT","Narine holes out to Brathwaite at mid-on. 113.4ks, slower knuckle ball on the leg stump, Narine attempts a loft but can only toe-end it in the air to Brathwaite inside the circle. Narine has done his job, though"
3.1,"Kaul to Narine, 2 runs","dipping full-toss, swings away late, Narine toe-ends it in the air to the left of Shakib at cover"

2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, 1 run",tucked off the hips through square leg for one
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, FOUR runs","Make that four boundaries in a row. Knuckle ball, but the length is shortish. Narine reads the change-up. Clears his front leg and hoists it over the bowler's head"
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, FOUR runs","back of a length on the hips, 142.1ks, Narine clears his front leg again, this time he drags it away square of short fine leg for a hat-trick of boundaries"

1.6,"Ahmed to Lynn, SIX runs","Smashed flat and hard for six. Length ball, angling away from Lynn, he backs away outside leg, fetches it from outside off and smears it over the covers"
1.5,"Ahmed to Narine, 1 leg bye","short at Narine's arm pit, 144.6ks, cramps the batsman for room, flapped away to square leg"
1.4,"Ahmed to Narine, no run","lifter on middle, 144.3ks, Narine sways his upper body out of the way. That's the length to Narine, Khaleel"
1.3,"Ahmed to Lynn, 1 run","really full on off, 144.6ks, Lynn clears his front leg and hammers it wide of mid-off. Brathwaite throws himself to his left to stop the ball"

0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, no run","back of a length - the perfect length on this pitch - ducks back in on top of off, punched up to the covers"
19.6,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, SIX runs","slower delivery, he fetches this from way outside off and muscles this over long-on. Is this a game-changing knock? Stunning hitting. Once again Prasidh lost his length, bowled too full. Rashid was expecting it as he waited, waited, waited and then clobbered it away."
19.5,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, 2 runs",has he clobbered this or what? Not much timing but plonks between the man running in from square leg and the boundary rider. They're back for the second.
19.5,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, 1 wide","full but far too wide outside off, pressure getting to Prasidh"
19.4,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, SIX runs","remember that stroke! So reminiscent of that flick Carlos hit to win the World T20! Full and sliding in, Rashid takes a step outside off and brings his powerful wrists to flick this over deep backward square leg. Sensational. Used the depth of the crease superbly"
19.3,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs","slower and fuller on middle, he holds his shape and then lofts this cleanly over the bowler's head. Long-off was in so all he needed to do was loft this over the infield"

19.1,"Prasidh to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR runs","backs away and uses the width to slice this over backward point, clever from Bhuvi"

18.5,"Shivam Mavi to Rashid Khan, no run","backs away and looks to eases this slower length ball over point, beaten."
18.4,"Shivam Mavi to Rashid Khan, no run",drills this straight to the man at the edge of the ring at cover.
18.3,"Shivam Mavi to Rashid Khan, SIX runs"," bursts through Chawla's hands at deep point for six!  Steps out and slaps this length ball, would've been straight down his throat had he stayed right at the ropes. May have come in a little too much"
18.2,"Shivam Mavi to Rashid Khan, no run","beaten for pace! 142.4kph. Short of length outside off, Rashid looks to punch on the up but is beaten"
18.1,"Shivam Mavi to Pathan, OUT","gets more elevation than distance, Piyush Chawla running in from sweeper cover takes an excellent catch! Yusuf looked to go over long-off, sliced it. That said the ball was swirling, curved away late even as Chawla misjudged it as it descended. Somehow managed to stay low and complete it despite this being away from his body."
17.6,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs",thick outside edge that beats a leaping DK. Looked to hoick this across the line
17.5,"Prasidh to Brathwaite, 1 run, OUT","stunning effort in the deep by Nitish Rana! This is yorker-length outside off, Carlos carves this with an opened bat face towards square third man, where he covers at least 20 yards around the ropes before diving. Recovers quickly and then throws right on the bounce to DK who whips the bails off to beat a diving Carlos."
17.5,"Prasidh to Brathwaite, 1 wide",flirts with the wide line. Saw the batsman backing away and bowled this wide. Easy call for Nitin Menon
17.4,"Prasidh to Brathwaite, SIX runs","misses a yorker, turns this into juicy full toss on middle and he muscles this over wide long-on. Too easy"
17.3,"Prasidh to Brathwaite, no run","right into the blockhole, base of middle stump, Carlos manages to dig this out"
17.2,"Prasidh to Pathan, 1 run",No power on the pull. Slower length ball which Yusuf drags from outside off to deep square on the bounce.

16.6,"Narine to Pathan, no run","skids one at length outside off, Yusuf lunges forward and leaves alone"
16.5,"Narine to Hooda, OUT","the reverse sweep, but there's no timing because of the length. Straight to point. The bounced more than Hooda would've liked. First wicket for Narine on the night."
16.4,"Narine to Hooda, no run","goes for a mow, played too early and missed. Hit high on the right thigh."

15.1,"Kuldeep to Hooda, OUT"," Backing up too far and Shakib's gone!  Full on middle, this has been drilled back straight. This flicks Kuldeep's fingers along the way and smashes into the stumps even as Shakib is nowhere near the crease at the non-striker's end. This is a big, big moment in the game."
14.6,"Narine to Hooda, 1 run",dabs this gently to short third man for a quick single.
14.5,"Narine to Hooda, 2 runs","floated outside off as Hooda advances, he reaches out and slices this over the infield, Uthappa was circling below the ball and allowed it to bounce before he took it at deep cover."

14.3,"Narine to Shakib, FOUR runs","backs away, gets underneath the flight and plays this slog sweep all along the ground to beat wide long-on."

13.1,"Kuldeep to Hooda, 1 run",driven with the spin to long off
12.6,"Chawla to Shakib, no run","looks to turn this behind square, gets it high on the bat, DK runs to his right to stop that."
12.5,"Chawla to Shakib, no run","hammered back on the bounce, good stop off his own bowling"
12.4,"Chawla to Shakib, no run","turns this googly towards midwicket, Chawla runs quickly to his left to prevent a single"

12.2,"Chawla to Shakib, FOUR runs","backs away and gets underneath the flight to drill this, beats wide long-off. Gave all his might. Just a little bit of width that time from Chawla, punished."

11.6,"Narine to Shakib, no run","Once again looking to back away, only to see the bowler cleverly alter his line. Skids back in to hit him on the pad, but Shakib was miles outside leg."
11.5,"Narine to Hooda, 1 run",rocks back and pulls this straight to Chawla at deep square leg
11.4,"Narine to Hooda, no run",hit on the back pad by a knuckleball that spins away off length. Played down the wrong line

10.5,"Chawla to Shakib, no run","chops this into the off side as he shaped to cut, cramped for room"

10.3,"Chawla to Saha, OUT","this is sensational from DK, not so much for the effort but for the alertness. This fizzing googly drifts in from length to hit Saha on the pad as he looks to defend, rolls to Karthik off the pad. By now, Saha is overbalanced and Karthik picks up the ball and breaks the bails even as Saha turns and looks to plonk the bat back in. The only reason why the third umpire was summoned perhaps was to check if the bails were broken by the gloves without the ball lodged in."
10.2,"Chawla to Shakib, 1 run","leading edge but safe, just eludes point. Shakib wanted to muscle this googly over deep midwicket"
10.1,"Chawla to Shakib, FOUR runs","right int he slot, drilled to deep extra cover. Juicy from PC to his old KKR mate"
9.6,"Kuldeep to Saha, FOUR runs","tossed up slower and higher outside off, Saha stretches out for a sweep and nails it to the left of deep square leg for four"

9.3,"Kuldeep to Saha, 1 run","full and spins in, worked to leg"
9.2,"Kuldeep to Saha, FOUR runs","floated up on middle, Saha stretches out and paddles it fine of Narine at short fine leg. Narine simply escorts it to the boundary"
9.1,"Kuldeep to Saha, no run",another big appeal for lbw. Did that pitch outside the line of leg stump? Umpire Nitin Menon shoots down the appeal. DK calls for a review. Saha aims a sweep and smothers it with the bat
8.6,"Prasidh to Shakib, 2 runs",short and skids back in to hit Shakib on the mid-riff. He sneaks in a leg bye and another off a ricochet

7.6,"Kuldeep to Shakib, 1 run","good length and spins away outside off, blocked off the back foot"
7.5,"Kuldeep to Williamson, OUT","Kuldeep has dismissed Dhawan and Williamson in the same over. He leaps for joy and celebrates. Williamson knows he has nicked off and walks off.

7.4,"Kuldeep to Williamson, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, Williamson collapses his back knee and drives it through the covers"
7.3,"Kuldeep to Saha, 1 run","tossed on middle and turns away, googly? Saha now squirts a leading edge to point"
7.2,"Kuldeep to Williamson, 1 run","lovely dip and turn for Kuldeep, Williamson does not meet the pitch and squirts a leading edge to the leg side"
7.1,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, OUT","Kuldeep traps Dhawan lbw. He then collapses in his followthrough while appealing. Kuldeep loops it up on middle stump, straight ball, Dhawan misses it, looking to drag it away to the leg side with a sweep. He is pinned on the back thigh in line with middle. That's pretty adjacent and KKR find their first breakthrough"
6.6,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 1 run","Chawla pushes this one wide of off, Dhawan drags a slog-sweep to deep midwicket"
6.5,"Chawla to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","dragged down outside off, Dhawan skips back and flat-bats it fiercely to the left of long-off"
6.4,"Chawla to Saha, 1 run","Chawla draws an appeal for leg before. Not given. Googly from Chawla, Saha attempts a sweep and ends up gloving it through backward square leg"

5.3,"Narine to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower through the air on leg stump, worked through square leg for one more"
5.2,"Narine to Saha, 1 run","short on off stump, not much spin, Saha hangs back and forces a pull straight to deep midwicket. Should've smashed it to the fence"
5.1,"Narine to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length on middle, Dhawan sits back and whips a single to midwicket"
4.6,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, FOUR runs","where did that come from, Saha? 145.5ks outside off, but it's on a length. Saha clears his front leg and hoicks it over midwicket. Not middled, but Saha won't mind it. His strike-rate nudges past 100 now"
4.5,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, 2 runs","banged in short and outside off, 138.7ks, Saha drags a pull through midwicket"

3.6,"Russell to Saha, no run","lifter on middle, 141.4ks, Saha ducks under it. Saha: 6 off 12 balls"
3.5,"Russell to S Dhawan, 1 run","dug in short and outside off, pulled on the bounce to deep square leg"
3.4,"Russell to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","more and more width. Slower ball outside off, 123ks, sits up to be hit, Dhawan reads the change-up and threads the gap. Punched between backward point and the covers"
3.3,"Russell to S Dhawan, no run","more width. Overpitched and wide outside off, drilled to the covers off the front foot. He can't pierce the tightly packed off-side infield. Five men there"
3.2,"Russell to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","shorter and outside off, Dhawan lines it up and flat-bats it straight past the bowler and Saha for four. Width and that's Dhawan's release. Slip has been pulled out"
3.1,"Russell to S Dhawan, no run","back of a length and skids off the pitch, hits the thigh and lobs to slip, where Rana dives forward but can't catch the ball"
2.6,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, no run","back of a length on off stump, Saha brings his bat down in line in defence"

2.4,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, 1 run","DK calls for the skier but misjudges it and drops it. Mavi hits a hard length outside off, Saha pulls and sends a top-edge in the air. It soars to Mars. Then drops down. DK looks to settle under it and the ball swirls away from his reach. He can only finger-tip it away"
2.3,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, no run","good length, starts outside off, cuts back in, Saha has a big yahoo at it but only collects fresh air"

2.1,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, 1 run","Saha rides the bounce of this back of a length ball outside off, taps to Gill at backward point, and sets off for a risky single. Dhawan makes it in the end"
1.6,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, SIX runs","140.4ks, but Prasidth sprays a full ball on the pads of Dhawan, feeds the opener's strengths. Dhawan simply picks it up and flicks it over the square leg boundary - the first of the night"

19.3,"Prasidh to Gowtham, no run","yorker on leg stump, and Gowtham moved to the offside to try and paddle it fine. He misses, and the ball goes down the leg side. They want a wide, but not given. Probably because Gowtham moved around so much"

19.1,"Prasidh to Gowtham, no run","full outside off, and Gowtham misses the big attempted slog! He expected the ball to angle in, but it held its line. KKR are through if Krishna can bowl five legal deliveries"
18.6,"Russell to Klaasen, no run","short! And the umpire says 'dot ball!' Klaasen ain't happy, but the cal stands. He did try to pull, but was nowhere near the shot. Royals need 34 off the final over"
18.5,"Russell to Klaasen, 2 runs","low full toss on middle, and that's been muscled to the man at cow corner. They're swinging hard, but just not connecting. One ball to go "
18.4,"Russell to Gowtham, 1 run","good length on off, and the batsman cannot connect with the pull! The delivery takes some extra bounce, and hits him above his waist"

16.5,"Chawla to Samson, OUT","in the air! And ""hear that roar"", says Varun from the Eden Gardens! Searles holds on at long on and the crowd goes ballistic. It was full on off, and he went for the pull once again. This time he can only slice it, and that brings an end to Samson's innings"
16.4,"Chawla to Klaasen, 1 run","backs away, and  carves it over point. Chawla saw him move, and therefore followed him. Good cricket all around"

16.2,"Chawla to Samson, FOUR runs","low full toss outside off, and that's been drilled over cover! One-bounce four, and the Royals dugout celebrates. Tried to bowl the quicker one, but missed his length"

14.6,"Kuldeep to Samson, 1 run","full on middle, and driven down the ground to long off. They walk across for the single, and what an excellent final over from Kuldeep! Is this the last of Kuldeep for IPL 2018, I wonder"
14.5,"Kuldeep to Klaasen, 1 run","short on leg, and whipped off his pads to deep midwicket. Finally manages to get off strike"
14.4,"Kuldeep to Klaasen, no run","length ball on off, and pushed off the front foot. Can play it only to cover"
14.3,"Kuldeep to Klaasen, no run","huge appeal, but turned down. It was full, but pitches outside leg stump. Turns inwards, and hits him in front off stump. Not given"
14.2,"Kuldeep to Klaasen, no run","almost cleaned up first ball! Full on off, and turning away from him. Tried to play it towards the on-side, but the ball zips past the outside edge"
14.1,"Kuldeep to Rahane, OUT","caught and bowled, once again! Tossed up on leg stump, and it's the wrong'un. Rahane prepares to sweep, but he's played it way too early. Comes off the bat's toe end, and the leading edge is swallowed by the bowler"
13.6,"Narine to Samson, no run","in the air, but short of cover! Full outside off and turning into the batsman. He's through his drive too early, so the ball lobs up. Safe eventually"
13.5,"Narine to Samson, SIX runs","sent into the stands! Uses the depth of the crease to make use of Narine's length. Slightly short, and it's been pulled to cow corner"
13.4,"Narine to Samson, no run","goes for a wild swing, but misses completely! The ball hits his front pad, but impact's on leg stump. That would never have gone on to hit the stumps"
13.3,"Narine to Samson, no run","good length outside off, but turning away this time! Mistimes his back-foot punch to Narine"
13.2,"Narine to Samson, no run","full just outside off, and he misses the leg-side whip. The ball comes off the bat's inside half, and ricochets onto his pads"
13.1,"Narine to Samson, no run","good length just outside off, but spinning into the batsman. Defended back to Narine"
12.6,"Russell to Rahane, 2 runs","slower ball to end the over. It's the offcutter, and Rahane taps it down the ground to long on. Played gently enough for them to come back for the second"
12.5,"Russell to Rahane, no run","misses the pull completely! Back of a length just outside off, but the ball stays low. Rahane misses the shot"
12.4,"Russell to Samson, 1 run","quicker ball! The extra bounce gets big on the batsman, but he still manages to fend it towards short cover. No one's there, so Samson rotates the strike as well"
12.3,"Russell to Rahane, 1 run","slower ball outside off, and Rahane punches it to the mid-on region off the front foot. Team hundred as well"
12.2,"Russell to Rahane, 2 runs","back of a length just outside off, and he drags it to the midwicket fielder. They scamper across for one"
12.1,"Russell to Samson, 1 run","good length on middle, and that's been flicked off his hips to deep midwicket"
11.6,"Chawla to Samson, 1 run","flighted outside off, and the ball turns inwards! Too close to his body for the cut, so Samson mistimes to short third man. He'll keep strike"
11.5,"Chawla to Samson, no run","almost a yorker on middle stump, and Samson's straight drive takes an inside edge. The ball ricochets onto his toes"
11.4,"Chawla to Samson, 2 runs","flatter ball, and it turns away from the batsman. Tries to punch it towards cover, but comes off the bat's inside edge. It trickles down to midwicket, and Samson returns for two"
11.3,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run","full on off, but Rahane takes a step forward and smothers it towards cow corner. Man there though"
11.2,"Chawla to Samson, 1 run","flighted outside off, but too wide. Allows Samson to free his arms, and driven to long off for a single"
11.1,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run","full on off, and that's been caressed down the ground to long on. A walking single on offer"
10.6,"Kuldeep to Samson, no run","length ball on leg stump, and turning into his pads. Tapped towards the non-striker"
10.5,"Kuldeep to Rahane, 1 run","low full toss outside off, and Rahane drives through the line. It trickles away to cover"
10.4,"Kuldeep to Rahane, no run","full just outside off, and this time it's been defended off the front foot"
10.3,"Kuldeep to Rahane, no run","slides just past the outside of his bat! A beautiful ball. Lands on off, and spin further away from the right-hander. Almost the dream delivery"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Samson, 1 run","attempts the paddle, but this comes off the bat's top edge. Falls over DK's head"
10.1,"Kuldeep to Rahane, 1 run","full and lands just outside of. He's quick to get down on one knee, and sweeps it to deep bmidwicket"
9.6,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Rahane, 1 run","chance of a run out, but misses! Length ball outside off, and it's been steered to short third man. They want the single, and they're going for it! Safe eventually"
9.5,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Samson, 1 run","slower ball, but wide outside off. Mistimes his cut to the off side, but has enough time to take the single"
9.4,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Samson, FOUR runs","width offered again, and Samson cuts it late enough for it to go between point and short third man. Absolutely played to perfection on this occasion"
9.3,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Samson, no run","punches this drive in the air, but it falls short of point. Length ball outside off again"
9.2,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Samson, SIX runs","pulled with disdain! Played so casually. Back of a length outside off, and Samson's so quick to play that kind of shot. Excellently played over cow corner"
9.1,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Rahane, 1 run","length ball, and too wide outside off. Comfortably cut off the back foot to deep point. A loose ball to start his spell"
8.6,"Kuldeep to Samson, FOUR runs","lofted with the spin, clean strike inside-out to the sweeper cover boundary. Lovely timing"
8.5,"Kuldeep to Rahane, 1 run","too full, googly that he smothers nicely to ease this to long off"
8.4,"Kuldeep to Rahane, no run",gets right to the pitch of the ball as he defends this back to Kuldeep
8.3,"Kuldeep to Rahane, no run","beaten by the wrong'un. Played at it with hard hands, spun to beat the edge. Tentative prod that"
8.2,"Kuldeep to Samson, 1 run",turns this gently with the spin towards square leg
8.1,"Kuldeep to Samson, FOUR runs","too short, and punished! Samson opens up the leg side and pulls this to the right of deep midwicket."
7.6,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR runs","delicate little dab, races past short third man. Welcome boundary. Not sure he intended to play it that fine but he'll take the runs"
7.5,"Narine to Samson, 1 run",gentle little push with the spin towards midwicket
7.4,"Narine to Samson, 2 runs","works this length ball from outside off towards long-on, the man coming in took a while to get off the blocks"
7.3,"Narine to Samson, no run",cuts back in alarmingly to beat the inside edge and hit him high on the left thigh. Had no clue
7.2,"Narine to Samson, 2 runs","whips this from outside off towards deep midwicket, aggressive running"
7.1,"Narine to Rahane, 1 run","spins back in from off, Rahane makes room and punches this to sweeper cover"
6.6,"Kuldeep to Samson, no run","picks the googly, gets forward and jabs this to cover. Superb first over from Kuldeep"
6.5,"Kuldeep to Samson, 2 runs","paddled nicely down towards fine leg. Kuldeep went flat, so he had pace to work with."
6.4,"Kuldeep to Samson, no run",leading edge that rolls to point. Bat was angled towards mid-on.
6.3,"Kuldeep to Rahane, 1 run",right to the pitch as he eases this to long off
6.2,"Kuldeep to Rahane, no run","hit on the back leg, but this one's turning too much. Rahane didn't pick it at all as he tried to work this to the leg side."
6.1,"Kuldeep to Rahane, no run","slider across the batsman, left alone. Drifted away as well"
5.6,"Chawla to Samson, no run",gets a good stride forward and he defends this full delivery back with a straight bat
5.5,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run",goes back into the crease and punches this to long on
5.4,"Chawla to Samson, 1 run",works this googly from length on middle to deep midwicket
5.3,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run",works this length ball from outside off towards long on
5.2,"Chawla to Samson, 1 run","drifts in from wide of the crease, punched to mid-on"
5.1,"Chawla to Tripathi, OUT","He survived in the previous over but the lost review doesn't cost KKR. Tripathi chips this back and Chawla puts his right hand out on the followthrough to pluck that off running to the left. Tripathi jabbed at this googly, got it high on the bat and it lobbed. Eden roars"
4.6,"Narine to Tripathi, 1 run",turns this shortish delivery gently behind square for an easy single
4.5,"Narine to Tripathi, no run","saved by an inside edge! Flatter length ball on off, he is struck on the pad but was very clearly a big edge. KKR review nevertheless, and lose one"
4.4,"Narine to Tripathi, SIX runs","goes big, clears the ropes again. This clears deep midwicket. This is the carrom bal that spins away from off, used his height to stretch forward, down on one knee and bang"
4.3,"Narine to Tripathi, SIX runs","down on one knee as he swings this over long-on. Clean strike, too full and get got underneath the flight nicely to back his strengths and clear the ropes."
4.2,"Narine to Tripathi, no run","sharp turn from middle and leg, hit on the thigh pad as he looks to whip this square"
4.1,"Narine to Rahane, 1 run","spinning back into middle and leg from length, turned wide of square leg"
4.1,"Narine to Rahane, 1 wide","slips this down leg, will have to rebowl that"
3.6,"Prasidh to Tripathi, no run","slower ball, but wide outside off. Tripathi waits for eternity trying to cut, but he misses. Wants the 'wide call' but the umpire isn't interested"
3.5,"Prasidh to Rahane, 1 run","full on off, and that's been driven down the ground. Played to mid off, and Chawla does well to intercept it"
3.4,"Prasidh to Tripathi, 1 run","back of a length on off, and cramps the batsman for space this time. Defended towards cover, and that allows them to steal a single"
3.3,"Prasidh to Rahane, 1 run","good length on off, and that's been played to the midwicket fielder off the front foot. Calls early for the single"
3.2,"Prasidh to Rahane, FOUR runs","too short, and Rahane won't let those go. Cuts it, and the ball flies over point once again. Could've gone for six, but lands just short of the boundary"
3.1,"Prasidh to Rahane, FOUR runs","finds the gap! Pitches outside off, and he was quick to gauge the short length. Flawlessly pulled, and placed perfectly between the two fielders in the deep"
2.6,"Chawla to Tripathi, no run","it's the google again. Lands outside off, and jags into the batsman's pads. Tries to cut, but too close to his body. Checks that shot, and chops it down to point in the end"
2.5,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run","angling into his pads once again, and Rahane turns it off his pads to the fielder in the deep on the leg side"
2.4,"Chawla to Rahane, no run","given! But will Rahane review? Yes he does. It was a skidder, that hit Rahane really low. The googly again that forces the error from the batsman. Way too much spin on offer, so wonder if that would've gone down leg. Replay time. And it's missing the stumps! Rahane survives."
2.3,"Chawla to Rahane, no run","good length outside off, but it's the wrong'un this time. Turns sharply into the batsman, and he punches it to cover point"
2.2,"Chawla to Tripathi, 1 run","flatter ball, on leg stump. Tripathi nudges it towards the vacant square leg region, but they settle for only the single"
2.1,"Chawla to Tripathi, FOUR runs","beautiful! Tripathi's a different batsman when he opens. It was flighted just outside off, and he leans into an excellent drive. Sweetly timed"
1.6,"Prasidh to Rahane, no run","length ball on off, and he fails to work it successfully towards the leg side. Defended eventually"
1.5,"Prasidh to Rahane, no run","full outside off, and Rahane chooses to defend it towards cover point. Played with soft hands"
1.4,"Prasidh to Rahane, FOUR runs","full on off, and that's drifting into his pads. Rahane takes a step forward, gets inside the line of the ball, and then drives it past midwicket for a classy four"
1.3,"Prasidh to Tripathi, 1 run","Tripathi backs away so Prasidh follows him. Full outside leg, and Tripathi can't drag it towards the leg side. Hits the handle of his bat, and the bat goes flying! They take the single though"
1.2,"Prasidh to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length outside off, but angling into Tripathi. Tries an extravagant cut, and the ball finds the edge of his bat. Sliced to third man"
1.1,"Prasidh to Rahane, no run","full on off, and he's through his front-foot drive too quickly. Comes off the bat's top half, and lands just in front of the bowler"
0.6,"Russell to Tripathi, no run","goes short, and Tripathi rides the bounce. Fends it off the back foot and carefully sees the over out"
0.5,"Russell to Rahane, 1 run","on off stump, and Rahane taps it with soft hands towards wide mid on. Will get Tripathi on strike"
0.4,"Russell to Rahane, SIX runs","carved over point! Uses the pace to cut it over the infield! Width offered outside off, and easily done by Ajinkya Rahane. Looks so good"
0.3,"Russell to Rahane, no run","length ball just outside off. Angling into Rahane, so he fends it off the back foot. Tapped towards Tripathi at the non-striker's"
0.2,"Russell to Rahane, no run","back of a length outside off, and he misses the cut. The ball takes the bottom edge and goes to DK. Russell falls over on his follow through, but looks okay"
0.1,"Russell to Rahane, 2 runs","falls in no man's land! Leading edge, and the ball teasingly soars over cover's head. Full on leg, and Rahane tried to play it towards square leg. Lucky, lucky"
19.6,"Laughlin to Russell, 1 run","yorker, squeezed to the off side as they scamper a single. Russell finishes on 49."
19.5,"Laughlin to Russell, FOUR runs","backs away and drills this fuller delivery to the extra cover boundary. Laughlin didn't miss his length by much, went for a yorker and got punished. Long-off was no more than three metres away from the ball, had no chance"
19.4,"Laughlin to JPR Scantlebury-Searles, OUT","has he timed this? No. Excellent catch by Archer running around from long-off. The good thing though is they've crossed over, so Russell will be on strike. Archer had to be mindful of the long-on fielder running across too, but he stopped in his tracks to allow Archer to complete it."
19.3,"Laughlin to Russell, 1 run","mistimes a swing off a thick inside edge to long on, Samson hared in even as he hit it"
19.2,"Laughlin to Russell, no run","backed away to swing this full toss over deep midwicket, but misses and hits his pads. Angled in and would've missed leg"
19.1,"Laughlin to Russell, FOUR runs","swung away to the wide long-on boundary. This was a mishit but didn't matter. Backed away, and swung this from outside off"
19.1,"Laughlin to Russell, 1 wide","too far wide outside off. Russell has the presence of mind, lets it go. He was initially backing away, so Laughlin went outside off. Just outside the wide line"
19.1,"Laughlin to Russell, 1 wide","veers in a yorker but just ends up slipping this down, Russell manages to get out of the way. Wide. Can't fault him for the effort"
18.6,"Archer to Russell, 1 run",backs away and belts this juicy full toss to sweeper cover. Just eight despite that six.
18.5,"Archer to Russell, SIX runs","slower short of length ball that got stuck into the pitch, Russell backed away, held his shape very nicely and then flat-batted this over long-off. Deep into the stands. Lined himself up superbly. Forehand for six"
18.4,"Archer to Russell, no run","right into the blockhole, he backs away to go over cover but can only manage to squeeze it back to the bowler"
18.3,"Archer to JPR Scantlebury-Searles, 1 run",pulled nicely but down to deep square leg
18.2,"Archer to JPR Scantlebury-Searles, no run","walks across to sweep this full delivery outside off, beaten. Just give the strike to Russell, mate!"
18.1,"Archer to JPR Scantlebury-Searles, no run","looks to swing this slower delivery over cow corner, beaten. Played too early"
17.6,"Laughlin to Russell, SIX runs","backs away but he's denied the free swing because Laughlin angles into his body. No problem. He still swings through, gets a top-edge that flies over the fine leg boundary."
17.5,"Laughlin to Russell, no run",Beaten! Backs away to carve this over point but Laughin shortened his length and angled it in to cramp him for room.
17.4,"Laughlin to JPR Scantlebury-Searles, 1 run","tails in late, yorker-length on middle, squeezed to midwicket"
17.3,"Laughlin to Russell, 1 run","bounce and angled in from wide of the crease, Russell looks to pull, the ball deflects off the thigh pad to short fine leg"
17.2,"Laughlin to Russell, SIX runs","sitting up nicely for the pull, Russell has muscled this over deep midwicket. Too short, not the best delivery to bowl at this stage. Russell didn't get it anywhere near the middle but still managed to clear it"
17.1,"Laughlin to Karthik, OUT","toe-ends this lofted hit and Rahane, moving backwards from the edge of the ring at cover, takes an excellent catch. Not easy, but he covered ground nicely. Big wicket, but DK's played a gem. Good execution of the slower ball, there as no pace to work with for DK."
16.6,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run",works this off length from middle to deep midwicket
16.5,"Unadkat to Russell, 1 run","slower and fuller, lucky to get away with that. Russell mistimes this slog over cover to the fielder at the edge of the ring"
16.4,"Unadkat to Russell, FOUR runs",Jaydev hasn't learnt. Keeps giving width and keeps getting whacked! Russell clears his front leg and slaps this to the extra cover boundary. Very poor
16.3,"Unadkat to Russell, SIX runs"," just over Samson's outstretched hands at wide long-on!  This is a slower length ball that spins away from outside off, Russell backs away and fetches this slap from outside off, ends up dragging it but still manages enough"
16.2,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run",steps out and wallops this length ball to sweeper cover
16.1,"Unadkat to Karthik, SIX runs","scooped him up and over the keeper's head, straight scoop for six. Half-century for DK. He was looking away while trying to use the pace, got a big, fat top-edge that just flew. This is injustice"
15.6,"Sodhi to Russell, no run",rocks back and cuts straight to backward point. Superb over.
15.5,"Sodhi to Russell, no run","through with the pull too early, this googly spun back in, took ages to arrive. Hits him in the midriff. Could've had a cup of tea and then pull"
15.4,"Sodhi to Russell, no run",square turn from leg stump to take a thick outside edge that rolls to short third man. Squared up completely
15.3,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run","too short, misses out! Rocks back to pull, gets it high on the bat, manages to squirt this down to long on"
15.2,"Sodhi to Russell, 1 run",makes room and punches this short delivery to sweeper cover
15.1,"Sodhi to Russell, no run","square turn from length, stops on him as Russell goes back and across to defend"
14.6,"Archer to Russell, 1 run","length ball on middle, and going down the leg side. But Russell manages to clip it off his pads to deep midwicket"
14.5,"Archer to Russell, SIX runs","maximum use of the free hit! Full on leg stump, and Russell gets his front leg out of the way before depositing it over the long-on boundary. Raw power"
14.5,"Archer to Russell, (no ball)","short on middle, and goes straight through to Klaasen again. Russell chooses not to play any shot, knowing that's too high. No ball for height. Free hit "
14.4,"Archer to Russell, no run","short! Pitches on middle, and soars straight through to Klaasen. Russell had made some room to pull, perhaps, but played no shot"
14.3,"Archer to Russell, no run","length ball outside off, but Russell was thinking of making room already. Eventually forced to reach at it, and punches it to cover"
14.2,"Archer to Gill, OUT","cramps him for space, and finds the edge! Back of a length on off and zipping straight through. Gill chose to cut, but it was close to his body. Finds the bat's top edge, and Klaasen makes no mistake. An exciting innings comes to an end"
14.1,"Archer to Gill, FOUR runs","thumped! Through point this time! Loose ball first up. Wide outside off, and Gill sent this powerfully for four"
13.6,"Gopal to Karthik, SIX runs","there's the fifty partnership! Yuuuge over. Half-tracker outside off and Karthik rocks back to earn some extra time. Swivels, and then pulls it over cow corner. Expensive!"
13.5,"Gopal to Gill, 1 run","length ball on off, but spinning into Gill. Taps it off the back foot to point"
13.4,"Gopal to Gill, SIX runs","going, going, gone! Teases Archer at long off, but goes just beyond him. Full on off, and Gill was quick to shimmy down the ground. Full swing of the bat thereafter"
13.3,"Gopal to Gill, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and that's been cut furiously past point! Proper cricket shot, and that breaches the infield. KKR getting a move on, now"
13.2,"Gopal to Karthik, 1 run","full outside off, and turning further away. Driven with the bat's open face to cover point on this occasion"
13.1,"Gopal to Karthik, 2 runs","flat on off, and DK walks across to the off side. Gets down on one knee, and paddles it to deep backward square. Work for Unadkat in the deep"
12.6,"Sodhi to Gill, no run","not afraid to flight the ball. Lands on middle, and entices the batsman to drive. Gill's through with his shot early, and it comes off his toe end. Still manages to find enough behind it, to take it to the fielder at long off"
12.5,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run","flighted on off, and he comes down the wicket before driving to long on. Easy single"
12.4,"Sodhi to Gill, 1 run","back of a length, on middle and leg. Gill goes onto the back foot and turns it off his pads to midwicket"
12.3,"Sodhi to Gill, 2 runs","whipped! Full on off, and he drags it to wide long on. Great uses of the wrists to direct it there, but Binny's dive ensures it's not a four. More runs saved by Binny tonight"
12.2,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run","flighted, and lands full on off. Karthik takes a big stride forward, gets to the pitch of the ball, and then drives through the delivery's line. Goes to long off"
12.1,"Sodhi to Gill, 1 run","length ball on middle, and turning across the batsman's body. Punched off the back foot towards midwicket on this occasion"
11.6,"Gopal to Gill, 1 run","pitches on middle, and that's been flicked to square leg. The region's vacant so they take a quick single. Gill wants the second, but that's a resounding 'no' from DK"
11.5,"Gopal to Gill, no run","length ball, wide outside off. Which basically means it's a googly. Gill rocks back, and punches it straight. Gopal stops it on his follow through"
11.4,"Gopal to Karthik, 1 run","flat on middle and leg, and worked off his pads to deep backward square. They walk across for the one"
11.3,"Gopal to Karthik, no run","full just outside off, and spinning into DK this time. Defended off the back foot"
11.2,"Gopal to Gill, 1 run","attempts that Kohli-esque inside out drive, but can only play it to long off. It was full on off, and tempting for the youngster"
11.1,"Gopal to Karthik, 1 run","tossed up on off, and driven off the front foot. Excellent stop by Tripathi there to keep it down to one"
10.6,"Laughlin to Karthik, 1 run","off the bat's shoulder, but lands safe! Length ball on off, but takes some extra bounce. He tried to nudge it towards the leg side, but the ball flies away towards point instead"
10.5,"Laughlin to Gill, 1 run","back of a length on the fourth-stump line, and Gill punches it off the back foot. Plays it square to the cover point region on this occasion"
10.4,"Laughlin to Gill, FOUR runs","uses the pace to play it fine, and KKR are third time lucky! Sodhi was fine enough, but this time the ball flew off the bat, and third man can't cut it off"
10.3,"Laughlin to Gill, no run","fuller, and just outside off. Driven to Gopal at mid off this time"
10.2,"Laughlin to Karthik, 1 run","carbon copy, and this time it's a more composed stop from Sodhi. Length ball outside off once again, and DK uses his wrists to open his bat's face late"
10.1,"Laughlin to Karthik, 2 runs","steered fine down to the third man fielder! Sodhi's dive stops the boundary. It was a length ball outside off, that DK opted to open his bat's face to"
9.6,"Gopal to Karthik, 1 run","googly which he didn't get to the pitch off, thick inside edge past leg stump to short fine leg"
9.5,"Gopal to Karthik, no run","right to the pitch as he eases this, backward point swoops in to prevent a single. Gowtham, I think it is"
9.4,"Gopal to Gill, 1 run",whips this length ball from outside off towards deep midwicket
9.3,"Gopal to Karthik, 1 run",googly which he gets to the pitch of as he eases this to cover point for a quick single
9.2,"Gopal to Karthik, no run","turn from length on off, steered to backward point"
9.1,"Gopal to Karthik, FOUR runs","gentle little tickle down leg. Too short and drifting down, DK went back and used the pace to deflect it expertly."
8.6,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run",gets right to the pitch of the ball as he drives this to sweeper cover
8.5,"Sodhi to Gill, 1 run",punches this googly towards deep midwicket
8.4,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run",turns this gently into the leg side for a quick single. Got close to the ball as he smothered that
8.3,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run","shapes to cut but doesn't pick the googly, there's bounce on this too as he's cramped for room, rolls back to the bowler. Hit him near the glove."
8.2,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run",goes back into the crease and defends back to Sodhi
8.1,"Sodhi to Karthik, 2 runs","steered this behind point, Unadkat runs behind and slides to stop that but can't prevent the second"
7.6,"Gopal to Lynn, OUT","punched straight back to Shreyas. Big wicket! Another googly that he lands on length outside off, this stopped on Lynn as he looked to punch, checked his stroke and Shreyas takes the simple offering on his followthrough. KKR in some trouble."
7.5,"Gopal to Lynn, no run",looks to sweep but this was spinning away sharply from outside off. Beaten
7.4,"Gopal to Lynn, no run","gets across the stumps to go over the leg side, changes his stroke and defends to the off side.  Confusion, confusion.  Lynn calls for the single, stops. DK is three-four steps forward and then turns back. All good in the end."
7.3,"Gopal to Lynn, 2 runs",whips this shortish delivery into the gap at deep midwicket
7.2,"Gopal to Lynn, no run","googly that spins back in sharply from outside off, defended to cover"
7.1,"Gopal to Karthik, 1 run","drifting into middle and leg, turned to short fine for a quick single"
6.6,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run",opens the bat face slightly to drive to the left of cover
6.5,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run",driven straight to extra cover. Got to the pitch nicely but no timing
6.4,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run","goes back and across to work this through midwicket, but this hits him high on the bat and rolls back to the bowler"
6.3,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run","checks his shot, punched on the bounce to cover. Square turn for Sodhi, but a touch slow"
6.2,"Sodhi to Lynn, 1 run","touch short and spinning away from off, punched to sweeper cover"
6.1,"Sodhi to Lynn, no run","googly but touch short, he mistimes a pull to short fine leg"
5.6,"Unadkat to Karthik, no run","full on off, he leans forward and eases this straight to cover. Expensive over."
5.5,"Unadkat to Lynn, 1 run","slower and fuller on middle, punched wide of mid-off for a quick single"
5.4,"Unadkat to Lynn, FOUR runs","slower length ball outside off, Lynn is down on one knee as he slaps this up and over cover. Disdainfully done"
5.3,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run","shortens his length but angles this wide, DK steered this behind square but Binny puts out a dive at short third man to save three runs"
5.2,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR runs","another teasing half-volley outside off, belted through the line between cover and mid-off. Very poor from the most expensive Royals' buy."
5.1,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR runs","fuller outside off, DK leans into this wide half-volley and lofts this inside-out over cover point. Lovely"
4.6,"Gowtham to Lynn, 2 runs","just a bit of extra rip for the final ball. Full on off, and worked off his legs to the backward square region. Enough time to come back for the second"
4.5,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run","length ball just outside off, and defended back to Gowtham off the back foot. Keeping it tidy"
4.4,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run","length ball on off, and that's been punched down the ground. Mid on's there"
4.3,"Gowtham to Karthik, 1 run","length ball on middle, and DK works it off his pads to the fielder at deep midwicket. He collects the single"
4.2,"Gowtham to Lynn, 1 run","full on off, and turning into his pads. Muscled down the ground to long on for a walking single"
4.1,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run",almost a yorker on leg stump. Lynn carefully pushes it back towards the non-striker
3.6,"Archer to Karthik, FOUR runs","and almost goes there first up! It was full on middle, and DK comfortably whips it off his legs past the square-leg region. Well timed, and there's no one there in the deep. Four welcome runs for KKR"
3.5,"Archer to Karthik, no run","full on off, and defended off the front foot. Tapped back to the bowler."
3.4,"Archer to Rana, OUT","disaster! Mistimed to midwicket. Full on off, and Rana looks for the release shot. Attempts to slog it over midwicket, but it's sliced. Easy as ABC for Unadkat"
3.3,"Archer to Rana, no run","short! This time it's aimed on middle stump, and Rana backs away trying to cut it over slip. Pulls out of the shot eventually though"
3.2,"Archer to Rana, 2 runs","length ball outside off, but angling in slightly. Opens his bat's face and taps it through cover point. Chase for the man in the deep, but he manages to intercept"
3.1,"Archer to Rana, no run","Back of a length, but outside off stump. Rana chooses to shoulder his arms, and the carry to the keeper is quite promising"
2.6,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run","wants a single, but sent back! Full just outside off, and carved off the front foot to cover point. Lynn's halfway down, but he's been asked to go back"
2.5,"Gowtham to Lynn, FOUR runs","just a bit more air offered, and Lynn smacks this through the cover region. Winds up early, waits for the ball to land, and then slaps it through the off side"
2.4,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run","full on off, and driven with the spin towards the non-striker"
2.3,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run","length ball outside off, but spinning into Lynn. Stands tall and slaps it off the front foot. But straight to cover"
2.2,"Gowtham to Rana, 1 run","full just outside off, and he leans into the cover drive. Pushed into the gap on the off side to get off the mark"
2.1,"Gowtham to Uthappa, OUT","leading edge, and caught by the bowler! Tossed it up, and Uthappa tried to work it towards the leg side. Through his shot too early, and the ball lobs straight back to KG. Big jump from the big man, and he manages to hold on to it. Two wickets in seven balls for Gowtham"
1.6,"Archer to Uthappa, 1 run","quick single to end the over. Back of a length once more, but Uthappa gets inside the line of the ball and defends with soft hands. Cover's too far, so Uthappa can call for the run"
1.5,"Archer to Uthappa, no run","back of a length on off, but Archer's really getting some pace. The ball gets some extra bounce, and hits his glove. Uthappa was merely trying to defend it off the front foot"
1.4,"Archer to Uthappa, no run","length ball on off, and angling in once more. Uthappa adjusts on this occasion, and nudges it off his body towards the leg side. Doesn't look comfortable at all"
1.4,"Archer to Uthappa, 1 wide","carbon copy! Pitches on middle, but the ball shapes into his body and then down the leg side. The umpire spreads his arms wide again"
1.4,"Archer to Uthappa, 1 wide","shaping into the right-hander, but just a bit too much! Back of a length on middle, but angling down the leg side"
1.3,"Archer to Lynn, 1 run","mistimed this time. Archer pitched it on middle, but the ball jagged in sharply. Hits the shoulder of his bat, and goes towards square leg"
1.3,"Archer to Lynn, 1 wide","quick! Full on middle, but going down the leg side. Lynn did go chasing after it, but couldn't manage to clip it off his hips"
1.2,"Archer to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball just outside off, and angling in slightly. Uthappa drops his gloves and plays it towards the leg side off the back foot"
1.1,"Archer to Lynn, 1 run","drops just short of mid on! It was full on off, and Lynn goes for a slog towards the leg side. Comes off the bat's inside half and lobs in the air. Lands between midwicket and mid on"
0.6,"Gowtham to Uthappa, 4 byes","gone through everybody! Attempts the reverse sweep, but the ball spins sharply down the leg side. Won't be called a wide since Uthappa changed his stance, but Klaasen can't hold onto that either"
0.5,"Gowtham to Lynn, 1 run","full just outside off, and nicely driven straight down the ground. Gowtham gets his hands behind the ball, but it ricochets towards mid off. They jog across for one"
0.4,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run","full outside off, and spinning into Lynn. Tries to drive it towards midwicket, but it takes a leading edge! Falls in front of cover point"
0.3,"Gowtham to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball on off, and spinning into Uthappa. Keeps his eyes on the ball and nudges it off his pads to the leg side"
0.2,"Gowtham to Narine, OUT","aaaand stumped! Narine came dancing down the wicket, but Gowtham dropped his length. Pitches it just outside off and the ball spins away from Narine. He misses, and Klaasen whips the bails off in no time. Big, big wicket!"
0.1,"Gowtham to Narine, FOUR runs","slapped for four! Starts around the wicket, and pitches outside off. Narine backs away, makes some extra room, and crunches this past the diving cover fielder. Tripathi the man who couldn't stop it"
19.1,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, SIX runs","Straight drive over the bowler's head, and Faf du Plessis has taken CSK into the IPL final! Seventh time in their history. The Wankhede's gone ballistic. It was full on off, and Faf went for the big one. Proper follow through of the bat and the ball lands just beyond the boundary line."
18.6,"Kaul to Thakur, FOUR runs","full on middle, and he's smashed a straight drive over the bowler's head! Would you believe it. The apparent villain of CSK's bowling effort has turned on the heat and how! CSK need six off the final over"
18.5,"Kaul to Thakur, 2 runs","full on off, and he bunts it down the ground to long off. They're going for a suicidal second, but Faf manages to complete the run! What a sprint from Faf."
18.4,"Kaul to du Plessis, 1 run","knuckle ball just outside off, and Faf manages to push it towards cover. Just a single on offer this time. CSK need 12 off eight balls"
18.4,"Kaul to du Plessis, 1 wide","full outside off, but the ball shapes further away. Goes beyond the tramlines, and umpire Erasmus says extras"
18.3,"Kaul to Thakur, 1 run","full just outside off, and muscled over the bowler's head. Dhawan's at long off. One run to the total, but importantly Faf's on strike"
18.2,"Kaul to Thakur, FOUR runs","Lucky, lucky, lucky! What some like to call the French cut. Length ball on off, and angling into Shardul. He tried to punch it straight, but the ball came in, took the inside edge, and went past the keeper's left for four more"
18.1,"Kaul to Thakur, FOUR runs","low full toss outside off, and he's edged it between the keeper and a fine short third man. It was a yorker just outside off, but Thakur manages to find some bat on it. He'll take it. CSK'll take it"
17.6,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, FOUR runs","full outside off, and Faf connects with the square drive! Carves it past cover point, and the man in the deep can't cut it off either! Classic CSK. Twenty-three runs needed off 12"
17.5,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, 1 run, OUT","full on off, and that's been creamed through the cover region. Looks like four, except Rashid's tumbling effort stops that at wide long off. Recovers quickly, and throws it in flat at the bowler's end. Brathwaite collects, and then brings the stumps down with his right hand. Harbhajan's nowhere near!"
17.4,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, FOUR runs","slower ball, on a good length. It pitches on off, and Faf tries to pull it square. He's deceived by the pace, and the ball comes off Faf's bottom edge. That takes the ball finer than he would've like, but Faf won't mind. Gone for four"
17.3,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, SIX runs","full on leg, and that's been deposited into cow corner! Fifty for Faf! It pitched just ahead of his front leg, and Faf's enjoying the extra pace. Gets his front leg out of the way, and swings his bat thoroughly"
17.2,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, FOUR runs","overpitched outside off, and that's been drilled over cover! Manages to get his bat under this delivery, and powerfully lifts it over the infield"
17.1,"Brathwaite to Harbhajan, 1 run","slower ball, but full outside off. Big wind up from Harbhajan, but he mistimes a leg-side slog. The ball goes past Faf to long on. Importantly, gets off strike."
16.6,"Kaul to Harbhajan, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and Harbhajan pulls it to the fielder at deep midwicket. Kaul's happy to concede a single off the final ball. That means Bhajji's back on strike"
16.5,"Kaul to Harbhajan, no run","yorker, and just outside off. Harbhajan tries to open his bat's face, to run it down fine, but misses completely! That's zero off seven balls for Harbhajan"
16.4,"Kaul to du Plessis, 1 run","low full toss outside off, and that's been slapped to cover. The shot was good enough to beat the infielder, but KW's diving effort stops the boundary"
16.3,"Kaul to Harbhajan, 1 leg bye","full on leg, and Harbhajan attempts to flick it towards the leg side. Hits his front leg, though, and that's enough for CSK to take a single"
16.2,"Kaul to Harbhajan, no run","knuckle ball outside off, and Harbhajan can't even connect with the drive. The ball angled away slightly after pitching, and that, perhaps, put the batsman off. Through to Goswami"
16.1,"Kaul to du Plessis, 1 run","on off stunmp, and he tries to lift it over the bowler's head. Timed well, but it's in the air! Lucky for him, it drops short of Brathwaite at long on"
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Harbhajan, no run","ripping legbreak, beats the outside edge. Good length, angling in, then bursts away past the hanging bat"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Harbhajan, no run","full on a fourth-stump line, defended back to the bowler"

15.2,"Rashid Khan to du Plessis, 1 run","full and dips on off, driven past the left of the bowler to long-off"
15.1,"Rashid Khan to du Plessis, no run","quicker googly from Rashid, zips back in and pins the front pad below the knee-roll. The finger goes up. Faf asks for a review. No inside edge but this seems to be heading down the leg side. The tracker suggests it's going down leg"
14.6,"Sandeep to Chahar, OUT","Is that a clean catch from Brathwaite? He does not claim the catch. The soft signal from umpire Erasmus is out. They go to the TV umpire now. He dives forward, Brathwaite stretches his hands out, and wraps his fingers around it. Or did that bounce into the turf and into the hands. The close-ups are quite blurry. No conclusive evidence. TV umpire Ravi does not have conclusive evidence to overturn the soft signal. Chahar has to go. This was full and outside off, dragged off the bottom of the bat to long-on. Excellent effort from that man Carlos Brathwaite"
14.5,"Sandeep to du Plessis, 1 run","slower ball, dips at off, 116ks, Faf leading-edges it to the covers"
14.4,"Sandeep to du Plessis, FOUR runs","a bit too full and outside off, Faf gets under the length and scythes it up and over Williamson at short cover"
14.3,"Sandeep to du Plessis, no run","back of a length and outside off, knuckle ball at 111ks, stabbed back to the right of the bowler. Faf sends Chahar back"
14.2,"Sandeep to Chahar, 1 run","full-toss on off, stretches out and drives to long-off"
14.1,"Sandeep to Chahar, SIX runs","slower short ball, sits up outside off, Chahar reads the change-up. Delays his big shot and slugs it over midwicket for a flat six"
13.6,"Shakib to du Plessis, SIX runs","drilled over long on! Tossed up on off, and Faf takes a big stride forward, before thumping it over the non-striker's head. The crowd erupts, and time for the time out"
13.5,"Shakib to du Plessis, FOUR runs","back of a length on leg, and angling further in. Faf makes room on the leg side, and drags a shot to the region between deep midwicket and long on. Two men converging, but Pandey fluffs the sliding attempt. Hits his hands and rolls into the boundary"
13.4,"Shakib to Chahar, 1 run","full on off, but turning away from the right hander. Knocks it past the non-striker to the vacant mid-on region. Shakib goes running behind it"
13.3,"Shakib to du Plessis, 1 run","full on middle, and angling into his pads. Pushed down the ground - off the front foot - to long on"
13.2,"Shakib to Chahar, 1 run","full just on off, and driven down the ground to long off. Enough time to walk across for the single"
13.1,"Shakib to du Plessis, 1 run","full just outside off, and that's been muscled away to deep point. The ball went squarer than he would've wanted"
12.6,"Sandeep to du Plessis, 1 run","knuckle ball outside off, and Faf chooses to chop it down to backward point. Early call for the run, and he'll keep strike"
12.5,"Sandeep to du Plessis, 2 runs","sticks with the slower ball, this time a length ball just outside off. Faf gets inside the line of the ball, works it off his pads to the leg side, and takes off for a couple more"
12.4,"Sandeep to Chahar, 1 run","good length, just outside off, and he pushes at it with soft hands. Played in the gap in front of cover, and Chahar gets off the mark"
12.3,"Sandeep to Jadeja, OUT","another caught and bowled! The slower ball does it again. Back of a length on middle, but he's through his front-foot defense too early. Tries to check his straight drive, but still can't do enough. Hits the top half of the bat and lobs straight into Sandeep's hands. Replays suggest that was the knuckleball"
12.2,"Sandeep to Jadeja, no run","accurate! Pitches on off, and keeps it tight. Too close to Jadeja's body to play it anyway. Chooses to fend it off the back foot"
12.1,"Sandeep to du Plessis, 1 run","starts off with the slower ball. Length ball, but back of a hand. Faf comes down the wicket, adjusts his shot, and then tucks it to the fielder at square leg"
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, no run","appeal for lbw, but turned down! Inside edge, I think. Length ball on middle, and turning into Jadeja. Hits his front leg, and impact's in front of leg stump, but the edge saves him"
11.5,"Rashid Khan to du Plessis, 1 run","length ball outside off, and going straight through. Faf stands tall and slaps it past the point region to the fielder in the deep"
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, 1 run","full on off, but spinning away from Jadeja this time. Pushed off the front foot to the cove region. Plays it rather safely"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, 2 runs","full on middle, and turning towards the leg side. Nudges it off his pads to the backward square region"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Bravo, OUT","straight to first slip! Half tracker on off, really, but Bravo goes chasing after it. Tries to cut, but it's the legbreak from Rashid this time. Turned a lot, and took some extra bounce too, and Bravo has edged it to Gabbar"
11.1,"Rashid Khan to du Plessis, 1 run","length ball on off, and Faf goes deep into his crease. Punches it off his pads to the midwicket region"
10.6,"Shakib to du Plessis, 1 run","drops the length a bit, and lands on middle. It's angling into Faf, so he backs away, and bunts a pull to wide long on"
10.5,"Shakib to Bravo, 1 run","they're choosing to deal with singles for now. Tossed up on off again, and driven to long off"
10.4,"Shakib to du Plessis, 1 run","full just outside off, and comfortably driven to the sweeper fielder on the off side"
10.3,"Shakib to Bravo, 1 run","full on off, and pushed past the non-striker to the mid-on region. No one's there, so Shakib goes chasing behind it"
10.2,"Shakib to Bravo, no run","full just outside off, and he tries to drive with the ball turning away. Mistimed towards cover"
10.1,"Shakib to Bravo, 2 runs","full on off, and worked off his toes to deep midwicket. Played with gentle hands, and that means they can easily jog back for the second"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Bravo, 1 run","tries to play inside out over cover, but takes the bat's inside edge. These batsmen are having a rough time facing Rashid. It landed wide outside off, and enticed Bravo to drive. Comes in, and finds the bat's inside edge"
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Bravo, no run","full on off, and turning into his pads. Tries to whip it towards midwicket, but misses the shot. Hits his front leg, but it would've gone down leg"
9.4,"Rashid Khan to du Plessis, 1 run","the googly! But manages to tuck it towards short fine leg for a single. It landed on off, and came back in sharply"
9.3,"Rashid Khan to du Plessis, no run","full just outside off, and he misses the drive! Did the keeper drop it? Extra bounce forces the batsman to miss the drive. Replays show no edge"
9.2,"Rashid Khan to du Plessis, no run","full, and wide outside off. Tried the wrong'un, but doesn't jag back so much. Driven with the bat's open face to cover point this time"
9.1,"Rashid Khan to du Plessis, no run","flighted in, and lands just outside off. Driven straight back off the front foot"
8.6,"Brathwaite to Bravo, no run","wide of the crease, back of a length and slanting in, impact in line but Bravo may have managed an inside edge"
8.5,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, 1 run","shortish and outside off, flat-batted away to sweeper cover"
8.4,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, SIX runs","banged in short and outside off, top-edged and it's a six at Wankhede. Banged in with extra effort, Faf hooks and skies it over deep square"
8.3,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, no run","short and skidding into the thigh, hits the thigh and rolls to midwicket"
8.2,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, no run","short and outside off, dragged off the inside half to short midwicket"

7.5,"Rashid Khan to Bravo, no run","another wrong'un, Bravo does not read it either, plays around his front pad. Impact may have been outside off with Bravo shuffling across"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, OUT","Rashid bursts through the gate of Dhoni. Tom Moody in the dug out has a big smile and high-fives Hales. Another googly, good length, breaks back in from outside off, Dhoni does not read the variation either, reaches out for a drive and misses. Rashid hits middle stump. Dhoni goes and with it CSK's hopes?"

3.4,"Kaul to Rayudu, OUT","Cracking delivery from Kaul.. My ball of the tournament. This was the big dipper from Kaul, a la Malinga, swings away so very late. Opens up Rayudu, beats him on the outside edge, and hits off and middle. He sends Rayudu back for a first-ball duck and pumps his fist animatedly. Look at Williamson, he's pumped too. This defence is on"
3.3,"Kaul to Raina, OUT","Kaul floors Raina's leg stump. Raina jumps across off, exposes his leg and middle stumps, and can't meet with a flick. Perhaps, he was expecting the short ball, especially with leg-gully in place. This was full, however, and Raina gave Kaul a free path to access it"
3.2,"Kaul to Raina, FOUR runs","full-toss outside off, Raina eases in to it and drives to the right of Pandey for four"

19.6,"Thakur to Brathwaite, OUT","Dhoni finally hits the stumps! Off the innings' final ball, heh. Shardul goes short on middle, and Brathwaite misses the pull. They're off for a bye, but Dhoni finally finds his aim. Sunrisers end on 139 for 7"

19.3,"Thakur to Brathwaite, SIX runs","juicy full toss outside off, and that's in his arc! Gets his front leg out of the way, and deposits this in the stands beyond long on"
19.2,"Thakur to Brathwaite, 2 runs","attempted ramp, that's been played in an ugly manner to deep midwicket. Low full toss on middle, and he had shuffled across to the off side. Can't play it fine enough, but still allows them to take the second"
19.2,"Thakur to Brathwaite, 1 wide","full and wide outside off. Shaping away from the batsman too, and he's forced to reach at it. Can't connect, but the umpire calls it as extras"
19.1,"Thakur to Brathwaite, no run","yorker wide outside off.  Brathwaite slogs, but the shot comes off his toe end. Mid off intercepts"
18.6,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, 1 run","length ball outside off, and it's the slower one to end the over. Opens his bat's face and pokes at it gently. Trickles it down to third man. Final over coming up"
18.5,"Ngidi to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run","outside off, and Bhuvi's done playing around. Wild swing, and sliced over cover. Falls juuust short of the man in the deep"
18.4,"Ngidi to Bhuvneshwar, no run","big swing of the bat, but the ball goes straight to Dhoni. Length ball on off, but the ball takes some extra bounce after pitching. Bhuvi misses. Again"
18.3,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, 1 run","back of a length on off, but angling right into the batsman's chest. Checks his cut, and glances it to third man for a comfortable run"
18.2,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, no run","length ball on middle, and going down the leg side. He tries to paddle it over short fine leg, but can't connect"
18.1,"Ngidi to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run","slower ball, and short outside off. Bhuvi tries to pull, but it's too wide for him to drag it square. Takes the bat's toe end, and goes down the ground instead"
17.6,"Thakur to Brathwaite, 2 runs","full, but outside off again. Tries for the big shot, and slices it over the infield. Bhajji cleans up at sweeper cover, but his throw is flat. Chance of a run out? Nope. Dhoni misses his flick, but Brathwaite's big strides would've saved him anyway"
17.6,"Thakur to Brathwaite, 1 wide","yorker, but way too wide outside off. No movement from Brathwaite, and umpire Erasmus calls it how it is"
17.5,"Thakur to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run","tries to lift this inside out over cover, but can't get the timing he's looking for. Goes to mid off on the bounce"
17.4,"Thakur to Brathwaite, 1 run","second yorker in a row, and this time the off-stump line forces Brathwaite to stop skipping around. Mistimes his drive to cover"
17.3,"Thakur to Brathwaite, no run","too cheeky, and Shardul gets away with a wide. It was full, but wide outside off, and Brathwaite tried to paddle it. Misses, but the umpire chooses to give the bowler the benefit of the doubt"
17.2,"Thakur to Brathwaite, SIX runs","and that's two in two. Can Brathwaite repeat his Kolkata performance? Length ball on off, and comfortable for the big man. Winds up, and then smashes this pull over wide long on."
17.1,"Thakur to Brathwaite, SIX runs","Remember the name, part 2? Full on leg stump, and he gets his front leg out of the way, and thumps it into the midwicket boundary. The crowd's come aliiive!"
16.6,"Bravo to Brathwaite, 1 run","ends his spell with a yorker. Aimed at leg stump, and squeezed back towards the non-striker"
16.5,"Bravo to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run","short on off, and that's been well pulled! It's sliding across the ground, but Jadeja's a beast in the deep. Covers a lot of ground in a flash, and his quick pick-up-and-throw ensures it's only a single"
16.4,"Bravo to Bhuvneshwar, no run","slow offcutter outside off, and jagging inwards. Big swing of the bat from Bhuvi, but he can't connect at all. Great disguise from Bravo"
16.3,"Bravo to Bhuvneshwar, no run","low full toss on off, and driven to the bowler. Mistimed, really"
16.2,"Bravo to Brathwaite, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and that's been cut to Bhajji at point. Almost forgot he was in the field "
16.1,"Bravo to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run","slower ball, full on middle stump. Worked off his toes to deep backward square for a single"
16.1,"Bravo to Bhuvneshwar, 1 wide","down the leg side again! Bravo appeals for the caught-behind, but the umpire's not interested. Calls it a wide again."
16.1,"Bravo to Bhuvneshwar, 1 wide","outta control! Slower ball, full on leg stump, and bouncing down the leg side. Bhuvi's happy to let this one go"
15.6,"Ngidi to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run","good length just outside off, and pushed with soft hands to cover point. They scamper across in a flash"
15.5,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, 1 run","length ball outside off, and opens the bat's face once again. Trickles down to third man"
15.4,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, no run","he didn't have a clue! Proper pace. Good length just outside off and zipping straight through to Dhoni. Brathwaite did try to glance it fine, but his bat was nowhere near the ball"
15.3,"Ngidi to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run","full on off, and pushed with the bat's open face. Goes down to third man"
15.2,"Ngidi to Bhuvneshwar, no run","length ball on off, and defended off the back foot. Bhuvi carefully ensures the ball doesn't bounce back onto his stumps"
15.1,"Ngidi to Brathwaite, 1 run","good length just outside off, but jagging into his body. Opens his bat's face and chops it down to short third man"
14.6,"Bravo to Pathan, OUT","what a catch! Tumbling forward while completing it! The stadium is on fayahhh! It was full outside off, and Yusuf's drive comes off the bat's bottom half. Low catch on offer from Bravo, and he dives forward on his follow through, holds on to the catch, and then spectacularly does a somersault to regain control. My oh my!"
14.5,"Bravo to Pathan, FOUR runs","slower ball outside off, and the cut's been slapped away! Enough room for the big man to finally free his arms, and that's been drilled to the sweeper cover boundary"
14.4,"Bravo to Brathwaite, 1 run","yorker on off, and it's been dug away to backward point"
14.3,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and muscled off his hips to deep midwicket. Jadeja pulls out of his throw last ball"
14.2,"Bravo to Brathwaite, 1 run","slower ball, and full on off. Brathwaite spots it, and waits for eternity, before whipping it to deep backward square"
14.2,"Bravo to Brathwaite, 1 wide","back of a length on middle, but going down the leg side. A soft appeal from the bowler - for caught behind - but no reaction from the umpire"
14.1,"Bravo to Brathwaite, no run","full on leg, and he misses the flick down the leg side. Hits the outside of his pad, and oes to short fine leg. Brathwaite wants the run, but Yusuf sends him back"
13.6,"Jadeja to Pathan, FOUR runs","ends his spell with a boundary, but what a terrific spell this has been nonetheless. Length ball outside off, that he backs away and cuts past short third man. No stopping that once it beats the infielder"
13.5,"Jadeja to Pathan, no run",stopped by Raina! The drive to mid off has been stopped by a diving effort
13.4,"Jadeja to Pathan, no run","full on middle and leg, and Pathan can't get bat to ball. Hits his pad as he attempts a leg-side flick"
13.3,"Jadeja to Pathan, no run","full on off, and comfortably driven off the front foot. Mid off cuts it off"
13.2,"Jadeja to Brathwaite, 1 run","full on off, and turning into his pads. Nudged off the front foot to the vacant mid-wicket region. Jaddu goes chasing again"
13.1,"Jadeja to Brathwaite, no run","full on middle, and he goes right across his stumps to try and sweep it square. Connects well, but only to short fine leg"
12.6,"Thakur to Pathan, FOUR runs","angling into his pads, and clipped off his toes to the midwicket boundary. The man in the deep tries to cut the boundary, but that's a futile attempt. Off the bat's sweet spot this time."
12.5,"Thakur to Pathan, no run","short just outside off, and the ball zips just past Yusuf's face! Nice line from Shardul"
12.4,"Thakur to Pathan, no run","full outside off, and Brathwaite takes a big stride forward to meet the ball on the full. Driven to mid off. Sunrisers' run-rate still under six"

12.2,"Thakur to Brathwaite, no run","length ball just outside off. Angling into Brathwaite, and blocked off the back foot. Played to cover point"

11.6,"Jadeja to Brathwaite, no run","good length on off, and fended off the back foot. Sees the over out"
11.5,"Jadeja to Brathwaite, no run","chance of a run out! But MSD misses. Full on off, and tapped towards the leg side. But the ball's barely gone ten feet away and Carlos runs down the wicket. Yusuf tells him to race back - with MSD chasing behind it - but the direct-hit never came!"
11.4,"Jadeja to Brathwaite, no run","pacey! Drills this straight on middle stump, and Brathwaite defends it back to the bowler"
11.3,"Jadeja to Pandey, OUT","leading edge back to Jadeja! Good length on middle, and looking to work it towards midwicket. He's through his shot too early, and the leading edge comes towards Yusuf, the non striker. But Jadeja scoots behind Yusuf and holds on to the offering. That's No. 5!"
11.2,"Jadeja to Pathan, 1 run","quicker delivery, on middle and angling down the leg. Whipped off his pads to deep backward square"
11.1,"Jadeja to Pandey, 1 run","full just outside off, and that's been driven off the front foot past cover. They walk across for the run"
10.6,"Chahar to Pathan, no run","back of the hand again, but this length ball outside off can't be put away. Spotted it early, and tried to pull it towards cow corner, but the shot comes off the bat's toe end. Yusuf looks at his blade to see the damage "
10.6,"Chahar to Pathan, 1 wide","short again! And this time the square-leg umpire spreads his arms wide. Tried the slower ball, but it loops over Yusuf's head. Remember, he's a tall man"
10.5,"Chahar to Pathan, no run","short! On the fourth-stump line outside off, but Yusuf chooses not to engage with it. Lets it go over his shoulder and through to MSD"
10.4,"Chahar to Pathan, no run","almost a perfect yorker on off stump. Yusuf jams it off the front foot, and sends it back to Chahar"
10.4,"Chahar to Pathan, 1 wide","slower ball, but awry line. Going down the leg side, and Yusuf actually gloves it. Doesn't go to Dhoni straight though. On the bounce to the keeper"
10.3,"Chahar to Pathan, no run","fourth-stump line, and rising onto Yusuf. Punched off the back foot to point on this occasion. Tight delivery"
10.2,"Chahar to Pandey, 1 run","good length on off, and this time Pandey punches it off his back foot. Goes past the non-striker, and to the man at long on"
10.1,"Chahar to Pandey, no run","low full toss on middle, and Pandey hits this straight to the only infielder on the leg side. Watson there, and he has a shy at the non-striker's stumps. Misses!"
9.6,"Jadeja to Pathan, no run","outside off this time, and Yusuf makes that extra room to cut it square. Can't get that perfect timing off his bat. Straight to cover point, and the batsman looks disappointed"
9.5,"Jadeja to Pandey, 1 run","good length on middle, and he leans back to pull it over the infield. Man at deep midwicket though"
9.4,"Jadeja to Pathan, 1 run","length ball on middle, and angling into Yusuf's body. Flicked off his hips to the vacant midwicket region. Forces Jadeja to go racing behind it"

9.2,"Jadeja to Pandey, 1 run","full on middle and leg, and comfortably worked off his pads to the square-leg region. They jog across"

6.5,"Bravo to Pathan, no run","bouncer outside off, Yusuf can't connect with the ramp"
6.4,"Bravo to Shakib, OUT","This is the left-hander's version of Williamson's dismissal. Another batsman has been strangled down the leg side. Dhoni dives to his right (yes, he dives) snaps it up.

4.2,"Thakur to Williamson, OUT",Williamson has been strangled down the leg side. He throws his head back in despair. Thakur sets off on a celebratory sprint. Thakur now hits a back of a length and angles it down the leg side.Williamson looks to pull but can only tickle it behind for a straightforward catch. Gloved to Dhoni. What an unfortunate way to go. Big scalp for CSK

3.5,"Ngidi to Goswami, OUT","Pace on the ball now. Ngidi dives forward, pockets a  low return catch, and lets out a big roar. Goswami continues to back away outside leg, Ngidi follows him and hits a hard length. Goswami is cramped and pulls weakly. He ends up flapping a low catch to Ngidi"

2.5,"Chahar to Goswami, 1 run",Goswami helps one to third man and gets off strike
2.4,"Chahar to Williamson, 3 runs","Has Dhoni missed a run-out chance? He leaps, collects the throw from Harbhajan, has enough time to deflect it onto the stumps. Instead, he tries a slam dunk and lets off Goswami. This was full and straying into the pads, picked off through square leg. They take on Harbhajan, Dhoni, and get away. Had Dhoni nailed it, Goswami would have been out"

19.1,"Sharma to Dhoni, SIX runs","a blockbuster finish! Mohit Sharma looks to double-bluff Dhoni, the man who mentored him through his early phases in this tournament. He bounces him. Dhoni knows it's coming. He's sitting on the back foot. He's ready - he sends the hook sailing over long leg"
18.6,"Tye to Raina, no run",length ball on off stump and a solid block on the front foot because Dhoni now gets to finish the game
18.5,"Tye to Raina, FOUR runs",off the middle! It has happened. Raina gets behind a bouncer and expertly taps the hook past short fine leg
18.4,"Tye to Raina, FOUR runs",another one lands short but this time it'll go through the fielder as well. Raina is mastering these toe-end strokes. Length ball wide outside off and he throws his hands at it. Sweeper done for
18.3,"Tye to Raina, SIX runs","just clears long-on this time! That's fifty. A slog right off the toe-end. Dropped short from Tye again, full swing from Raina again. Poor connection again"

18.1,"Tye to Raina, SIX runs","just clears deep midwicket. A new trend in the IPL, to keep your leg side boundary riders in a few yards. Raina picks the slower ball that's dug in short and drags it over that man who has to pedal backwards"

17.2,"Sharma to Raina, 2 runs","sliced to third man as he looks to pummel it over midwicket. Short ball slanted across him. Rajpoot gives his best there, running in. Has to stop it on the bounce after putting in the dive. Couldn't make it"

16.1,"Ashwin to Chahar, OUT",end of Chahar's adventure. And what a good one it's been for him. Showed two gears and the team will be very happy with him. It's a carrom ball floating away from him outside off. He slogs and gets it high in the off side. Easy catch in the infield

14.6,"Ashwin to Chahar, 2 runs","length on middle stump, flicked to long-on's right"

11.1,"Tye to Raina, 1 wide",knuckle ball dug in short and down leg side. He can't get bat on the pull
10.6,"Ashwin to Chahar, 2 runs","good length around off, some spin into him, punched wide of long-on and they sprint back for the second"
10.5,"Ashwin to Raina, 1 run","back of a length on middle, punched off the backfoot to long-on"

10.2,"Ashwin to Chahar, 1 run","full and sliding into leg, clipped to short fine leg"
10.1,"Ashwin to Harbhajan, OUT",gets down for another big slog. Not full enough and raps the pad of Harbhajan. He's hanging around contemplating a review but ends up walking away. Comes on straight from a length and pins him in front of middle and leg
9.6,"Axar Patel to Harbhajan, 1 run","pitched up around off, hammered down to long-on"
9.5,"Axar Patel to Raina, 1 run",shuffles across to a length ball and flicks to deep backward square leg
9.4,"Axar Patel to Harbhajan, 1 bye",goes for a big slog and gets an inside edge towards fine leg
9.3,"Axar Patel to Raina, 1 run","full, flicked behind square"

7.6,"Axar Patel to Harbhajan, no run","short around off, swings early and the ball finds the back of the bat as it goes behind the stumps"
7.5,"Axar Patel to Harbhajan, no run",again shuffles across early and swings big and misses outside off
7.4,"Axar Patel to Harbhajan, FOUR runs",walks across and then tries to slog it out of here but gets an underedge that gets past the keeper. Through his legs
7.3,"Axar Patel to Harbhajan, no run","shortish but not much room, forces a cut and finds point"
7.2,"Axar Patel to Raina, 1 run","full on middle, flicked with the turn to deep square leg"
7.1,"Axar Patel to Raina, no run","length, spinning in, tucked to short fine leg"

6.5,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, no run","short outside off, jumps on his toes and knocks it back to the bowler"
6.4,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, SIX runs","oh, he's crunched that. Bang off the middle. Superb connection. A wide length ball, clears the front foot and swings clean over extra cover"
6.3,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, no run",gets the front foot out of the way and swings and misses at a length ball outside off
6.3,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, (no ball)","short ball, swings for a pull and misses as the ball gets over the bat. Harbhajan asks if it isn't the second bouncer and then the umpire calls it a no-ball. He had walked down the ground too. Rajpoot can't be any less amused"
6.2,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, no run","short ball, too much pace and bounce outside off, Harbhajan tries to ramp it over but can't get on top of it"
6.1,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, no run","almost strangled down the leg side. Harbhajan moves across and tries a flick and the ball goes over leg stump. Barely! Geez, what's happening here!"
5.6,"Sharma to Harbhajan, 1 run",full toss on middle stump. Mistimed slog straight to square leg
5.5,"Sharma to Harbhajan, FOUR runs","finds the point boundary! Length ball outside off, gets the front foot out of the way and slices it over point"
5.4,"Sharma to Harbhajan, no run",wild heave is mistimed. It trickles out to mid-on. A length ball outside off
5.3,"Sharma to Raina, 1 run",he's early run out! Why is Harbhajan out there?! Calls for a run he can't make and is not even stretching to make the striker's end. Raina anxiously dabs another length ball to square leg and the fielder can't hit the stumps
5.2,"Sharma to Raina, no run","full ball on off stump, tapped from the crease into the covers. Some late swing there"
5.1,"Sharma to Raina, no run","length ball in the corridor, Raina nervously defends off the inside edge"
4.6,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, no run","dropped! Finch has dived in front of Gayle from second slip and put one down! Rahul chucks the ball away in frustration. CSK were this close to being in a disastrous position. Rajpoot, back of a length outside off. Harbhajan jabs at it with feet rooted to the crease. That was going straight to Gayle."
4.5,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, no run",back of a length outswinger outside off. Walks down the pitch and taps it into the leg side
4.4,"Rajpoot to Billings, OUT",got him! Ankit Rajpoot does not like simple endings! He's keeping Kings XI alive. A length ball that nips away marginally to beat a very nervous-looking forward defence from Billings - he's inside the line. The top of off stump is tonked and suddenly CSK will feel the nerves!
4.3,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, OUT",Gayle unsure at first slip if he's taken this. Faf driving on the up against an outswinger gets a thick edge. Soft signal is out. Gayle went weirdly at this - with a reverse cup with his right hand and a normal catching position with his other hand! Goes low to his left and it looks like he's managed it no conclusive evidence to overturn this. Faf is gone! Superb bowling finally rewarded.
4.2,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run","short of a length, curving away. Faf with the waft. Beaten"
4.1,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run",drives straight to cover. Nicely to the pitch of this full outswinger outside off
3.6,"Tye to Raina, no run",well done Tiwary. Leaps to his right and saves four. Raina leans in nicely for this cover drive on the up but can't get it past him
3.5,"Tye to Raina, no run",length ball swinging away outside off. Left alone
3.5,"Tye to Raina, 1 wide",short ball down leg side. Raina leaping to get out of the way and stabbing at it. Beaten
3.5,"Tye to Raina, 1 wide",bouncer. Down leg side.
3.4,"Tye to Raina, FOUR runs",boom! Steps out and pumps him straight! At a length on off stump again and he meets this outside leg to drill past his partner
3.3,"Tye to Raina, FOUR runs","slapped away. Too short from Tye. Sits up outside off stump and it's an easy put away. Aerial, over point"
3.2,"Tye to Raina, no run","good length, shaping into the corridor. Defended into the leg side off the inside half of the bat"
3.1,"Tye to Raina, no run","short ball slanted across off stump. Cut into the turf, on the bounce to point"
2.6,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, FOUR runs","shot. Won't allow you to bowl to me, says Faf. Gets down the pitch to cut out the swing and lifts one over the off-side infield"
2.5,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run","length ball swinging away, wide outside off. Left alone"
2.4,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, FOUR runs","outside edge past second slip! Scythes at another one outside off, goes fully at it. No position at all to execute that perfectly and it flies quickly to the third man boundary"
2.3,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run","leading edge to mid-off. Great bowling, this. Outswinger from middle stump. Faf's bat face is closed too quickly and this ends up at mid-off"
2.2,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run",beaten. Short of a length outswinger wide outside off. Slashes at it but it skids through from under
2.1,"Rajpoot to Raina, 1 run",big inswinger onto the pads. Raina falls over into the off side and glances uppishly towards fine leg
1.6,"Sharma to du Plessis, FOUR runs",past Mohit's outstretched hand! Faf jabbing nervously from the crease at this length ball. It doesn't have too much movement on it and that's probably what's deceived him a touch. Manages to find four from between mid-off and the bowler
1.5,"Sharma to du Plessis, no run","good length outside off, defended solidly on the front foot"
1.4,"Sharma to Raina, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, leaps to get on top of it and nudges through square leg"
1.3,"Sharma to Raina, no run",length ball just outside off. Defended into the covers from the crease
1.2,"Sharma to Rayudu, OUT","got him! The new ball is talking, the new ball as got CSK's best batsman of the season! Mohit hits a length just outside off, Rayudu jabs at it and gets an edge through to Rahul"
1.1,"Sharma to Rayudu, no run","close. Rayudu allows this to come very close to him, with no forward press. It's a length ball and he gets it onto pad off the inside edge"
0.6,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run","and again. Swing movement and bounce. Faf at it again away from the body, can't get a touch"
0.5,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run",squares him up. Shaping away from off stump and then jagging away with bounce off the pitch to beat him as he looks to defend on the back foot
0.4,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run","good length outswinger wide outside off, left alone"
0.3,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, 2 runs","short of a length on leg stump, nudged to midwicket with soft hands"
0.2,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run","lovely ball. Length ball shaping away outside off, drawing the bat away from the body before swinging past it"
0.1,"Rajpoot to Rayudu, 1 run",good length outswinger at off stump. Leans in and jabs with soft hands to get it down to third man off the front foot
19.4,"Thakur to Rajpoot, OUT","bowled out. Slower short ball at off stump, makes room and slices one to long-on where Faf is calm and very still a centimetre in front of the boundary. Graceful landing and that's out, confirmed by the replays"
19.3,"Thakur to Sharma, 1 run","full ball on the stumps, makes room and drills it to sweeper cover"
19.2,"Thakur to Rajpoot, 1 run","yorker outside off, has a heave at it again, thick outside edge to third man"
19.1,"Thakur to Rajpoot, no run","nice juicy length ball outside off, nice, clean, aimless swing somewhere in the middle stump vicinity. Beaten"
18.6,"Bravo to Rajpoot, 1 run","slower ball at a length on leg stump, tapped into the midwicket region off the back foot"
18.5,"Bravo to Nair, OUT","and then he msicues one to find mid-off. Nair is livid with himself. Seems to have been in the right place once again. A yorker and he's leg-side of it, trying to go inside-out between extra cover and mid-off. Gets it right off the toe to that fielder and whacks the ground with his bat"
18.4,"Bravo to Nair, SIX runs","fifty! And once again, he knows what's coming because he's made it so! The short ball, obviously. Steps out and swats it over wide long-on"
18.3,"Bravo to Nair, SIX runs","he's in full control. Once again, puts the pressure with one six and makes the bowler bowl exactly what he wants the next ball. Bravo's slower ball is anticipated - he's going down on his knee very early outside off. When it arrives, he scoops him over fine leg"
18.2,"Bravo to Nair, FOUR runs",hello! Karun Nair with an outrageous reverse pick-up from outside leg stump. Full and fired down leg side. He skips quickly into stance and taps this over backward point
18.1,"Bravo to Nair, no run","short of a length outside off, nudges it straight to point on the up"
17.6,"Ngidi to Nair, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, punched to long-on on the up"
17.5,"Ngidi to Sharma, 1 run","short of a length outside off, opens the face and gets it to point's right"
17.4,"Ngidi to Sharma, no run","length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
17.3,"Ngidi to Tye, OUT","chips the next one straight to mid-off. Ngidi with the Heavy BallTM  in the corridor again. Tye looking to jab at it well in front of the body, can only chip it harmlessly over the bowler. 4 for 8 for Ngidi. Kings XI's season closing rapidly "
17.2,"Ngidi to Tye, no run",a vicious yorker first up. Does fantastically to dig this out to mid-off
17.1,"Ngidi to Ashwin, OUT","a review this time. Ngidi must have charming eyes. Dhoni says he heard nothing but takes the review anyway. But Ngidi is right! Ashwin is looking to chop this length ball down to third man and he's got a very very thin edge on this! Ashwin is gone! What a review. Some climb in in the corridor from a length, very fast, and just enough for Ashwin"
17.1,"Ngidi to Ashwin, 1 wide",short ball down leg side. He looks to tickle it fine. Ngidi appeals. Umpire says wide. No review.
16.6,"Thakur to Nair, FOUR runs","lazy attempt from Dhoni and that's a missed chance. Nair backs away too much and is lunging to try and play a square drive. Gets a thick edge that flies to Dhoni's right and he only gets an obligatory right hand out at this, feet barely moving"
16.6,"Thakur to Nair, 1 wide",knuckle ball goes woefully wrong It's very wide
16.5,"Thakur to Nair, SIX runs",induces the bouncer by faking a shuffle. Quickly jumps back and gets inside the line to ramp this comfortably over deep square leg
16.4,"Thakur to Nair, FOUR runs",goes over extra cover. New favourite shot for Nair. Exposes the stumps and gets an overpitched ball again that he can open the face against as he goes aerially. Beats BIllings to his right
16.3,"Thakur to Axar Patel, OUT",give that man a raise! Sam Billings takes a stunner! A graceful leap forward after a short sprint in from a straight-ish deep square leg position and a tumble to kill the momentum without letting the elbow hit the floor - top class athleticism. Axar slices the short ball and it's dipping fast
16.2,"Thakur to Axar Patel, 2 runs","misfield at mid-off. Length ball just outside off, mistimed, slic-ey punch on the up from Axar. Chahar gets down very slowly and allows it to pass"
16.1,"Thakur to Nair, 1 leg bye","length ball on leg stump, backs away and gets followed down leg side. Looks to flick it uppishly but can't get bat on it"
15.6,"Jadeja to Nair, 1 run","pushed through at off stump, punched to long-off"
15.5,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, 1 run","length ball on off, punched to long-off"
15.4,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, SIX runs",oh well played. Jadeja is firing it in to make sure they don't get a swing on the front foot. So he goes on the back foot and uses that pace to slap it wide of long-off. Stunning hit
15.3,"Jadeja to Nair, 1 run",short of a length and in at leg stump. Backs away and slices to sweeper cover. Jadeja pushing em in fast
15.2,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, 1 run","length ball at leg stump, pulled to deep midwicket from the crease"
15.1,"Jadeja to Nair, 1 run","length ball into leg stump, punched to long-on off the front foot"

14.4,"Bravo to Nair, 1 run","short of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
14.3,"Bravo to Axar Patel, 1 run",loops slower ball on leg stump. Flicked to deep square leg
14.2,"Bravo to Nair, 1 run","short of a length outside off, chopped to third man"
14.1,"Bravo to Nair, SIX runs","glorious shot. Exposes the stumps and lofts it wide of long-off with a clean, straight bat. It's overpitched on off stump and just what Nair needs to get this off the middle"
13.6,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, no run","short of a length on off stump, pushed back to the bowler from the crease"
13.5,"Jadeja to Nair, 1 run","backs away, gets followed. Shovels it to deep backward square"
13.4,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, 1 run","length on leg stump, tickled to fine leg off the thigh guard"
13.3,"Jadeja to Nair, 1 run","length ball on the stumps, backs away and punches to long-off"
13.2,"Jadeja to Nair, SIX runs","his go-to shot clears Ngidi at deep backward square. Nair likes to sweep. Jadeja has ample pace for that and despite getting too far under this and getting it off the toe-end, he clears the man"
13.1,"Jadeja to Nair, no run","short of a length slider outside off, chopped straight to point"
12.6,"Bravo to Axar Patel, no run","length ball on middle stump, punched back to the bowler on the up"
12.5,"Bravo to Axar Patel, no run",beaten on the inside edge. Plays down the wrong line at this. It's in the corridor and he's poking well wide from that. Bravo thinks there's an edge but Dhoni's in no mood
12.4,"Bravo to Nair, 1 run","good length on middle stump, punched on the up to long-on"
12.3,"Bravo to Nair, no run","length on middle stump, tapped to midwicket from the crease"
12.2,"Bravo to Axar Patel, 1 run","full ball outside off, a nice-looking straight drive to long-off"
12.1,"Bravo to Miller, OUT",bowled him! Beauty from Bravo. The perfect yorker. Miller shuffles and comes back in line but it's all too much because he won't be able to keep this yorker from hitting off. Right on the crease and crash. Two set batsmen gone in six balls.
11.6,"Jadeja to Miller, 1 run","length ball on leg stump, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot and then calls for a suicidal second run. Karun rightly sends him back and he has to dive in the end. Jadeja misses the stumps after collecting the throw. Might have just made it "
11.5,"Jadeja to Nair, 1 run","arm ball at a length, skidding into the stumps. Pushed into the off side from the crease"
11.4,"Jadeja to Nair, no run","short of a length just outside off, tapped to midwicket off the back foot"
11.3,"Jadeja to Miller, 1 leg bye","length ball on leg stump, deflected into the leg side as he looks to flick off the front foot"
11.2,"Jadeja to Nair, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, leans in and clips it through the open midwicket region with soft hands"
11.1,"Jadeja to Tiwary, OUT","there's a sound as Dhoni takes this. Yeah he's out. No one appeals. But Tiwary and Dhoni both no he's got an edge on this attempted slog sweep. Once again, before the review can be taken, a batsman walks off. Routine length ball outside off and a very tame, sober sequence of play breaks the partnership. Good innings from Tiwary"
10.6,"Thakur to Miller, no run","low full toss wide outside off, steps out and completely misses the slash outside off"
10.5,"Thakur to Miller, 2 runs",something in the pitch today if you dig it short. Another top edge as Miller is late on the pull. Lands well in front of fine leg
10.4,"Thakur to Tiwary, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, shuffles and flicks straight to long leg"
10.3,"Thakur to Tiwary, no run","length ball just outside off, jabbed straight to extra cover on the up"

10.1,"Thakur to Tiwary, 1 run","short of a length outside off, back-foot square drive is stopped by Rayudu who dives to his right at point"
9.6,"Bravo to Tiwary, 1 run","short of a length outside off, opens the face and runs it down to third man"
9.5,"Bravo to Tiwary, FOUR runs",top edge as he looks to hook. Flies over Dhoni. Sharp short one from Bravo just outside off and he's too late on the shot
9.4,"Bravo to Miller, 1 run","loopy slower ball on leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket to pinch a single"
9.3,"Bravo to Tiwary, 1 leg bye",leg stump length ball. Tickled fine off the thigh guard. Dhoni fields and the batsman is caught staring at him as his partner calls through for a run and gets halfway down the pitch with no response. All safe in the end
9.2,"Bravo to Miller, 1 run","full ball outside off, plants the front leg across into the off side and looks to flick. Gets it off the leading edge to long-off"
9.1,"Bravo to Miller, 2 runs","short of a length just outside off, slanted across the left-hander who slices it to third man's left"
8.6,"Thakur to Miller, 1 run",tapped to sweeper cover
8.5,"Thakur to Tiwary, 3 runs","length on off, punched to mid-off for a quick single. He throws at the bowler's end and misses. They take the overthrow. Then Bravo at square leg throws to Dhoni who lets it go through his legs and they take another overthrow"
8.4,"Thakur to Tiwary, no run","short and climbing into him without room, fails to get on top of it as he barely keeps it out"
8.4,"Thakur to Tiwary, 1 wide","full, tails away down the leg side"
8.3,"Thakur to Tiwary, no run","good length around off, plays late with an open face to point. Denies Miller a single late but he manages to make it back"
8.2,"Thakur to Tiwary, FOUR runs","full, tries to heave it over but skews it off the inside part of the bat. But it's through the gap backward of square leg"
8.1,"Thakur to Tiwary, no run","pacy length ball at 140.3 kmph on middle, blocked back"
7.6,"Harbhajan to Tiwary, 1 run",tries to sweep this non-turner from outside off and gets an inside edge that barely missesthe stumps
7.5,"Harbhajan to Miller, 1 run","full and straight, worked off the inside of the bat to midwicket"
7.4,"Harbhajan to Tiwary, 1 run","a bit of spin from a good length, shuffles across and punches to long-on"
7.3,"Harbhajan to Tiwary, SIX runs",just over a leaping Jadeja at long-on. Tiwary comes down the track and hoicks this one after getting right to the pitch
7.2,"Harbhajan to Tiwary, no run","good length and straighter, Tiwary bunts it back"
7.1,"Harbhajan to Tiwary, FOUR runs","short and wide, Tiwary rocks back and cuts very late to knock it through backward point"
6.6,"Chahar to Miller, SIX runs","swings at the sight of width, there's lot of room, so there was the chance that he may find the toe-end but he's done well to deposit it over long-off"
6.6,"Chahar to Miller, (no ball)","another bouncer, Miller walks across and bends, and as its the second bouncer of the over, it's a no-ball"
6.5,"Chahar to Miller, no run",swipes across the line to one that's angled across and misses

5.2,"Ngidi to Tiwary, 2 runs",angles in a short of a length delivery and it's gently turned away through square leg

4.1,"Chahar to Tiwary, 1 run","full on middle and leg, clipped to mid-on for a very tight single"
3.6,"Ngidi to Rahul, OUT",old wounds opened up for Rahul. Remember the Tests in Sri Lanka when he lost his stumps shouldering arms? It's happened again. A length ball that nips in sharply from outside off. Error in judgement costs Rahul
3.5,"Ngidi to Rahul, no run","good length outside off, subtle shape away, rips past the outside edge"
3.4,"Ngidi to Tiwary, 1 run","good length ball that nips in, comes forward and blocks and the ball goes off the inside of the at to mid-on. Tiwary is halfway down eager to get off the mark but is sent back. The throw misses the stumps and three fielders fall over it and they end up getting it anyway. Comedy of errors"
3.3,"Ngidi to Tiwary, no run","short of good length, angled in, blocked"
3.2,"Ngidi to Tiwary, no run",feels for this short of a length delivery outside off and gets beaten on the outside edge

2.6,"Chahar to Tiwary, 1 run",full toss that swings in and finds the inside edge behind the stumps
2.5,"Chahar to Finch, OUT","what a delivery! A brute from Chahar. Shortish, pushes him right back and then gets it to rip away off the deck to square up Finch who gets an outside edge to Suresh Raina who snaffles a sharp catch at first slip with the ball rushing onto him"

1.5,"Ngidi to Rahul, no run","short of a length on middle stump, defended into the leg side off the inside edge"
1.4,"Ngidi to Finch, 1 bye","beaten and Dhoni can't collect it cleanly. Length ball outside off, he slashes hard at it as it swings in the air after pitching. Keeps drifting away from Dhoni who parries it to third man"
1.3,"Ngidi to Finch, no run","short of a length ball banged into the corridor, climbing into Finch's body as he looks to defend on the back foot. Gets it off the inside edge into the leg side"
1.2,"Ngidi to Gayle, OUT","big appeal turned down, but Gayle walks off! Short ball on the hips. A tentative nudge from Gayle, trying to tickle it fine. He gets a glove on it and Dhoni takes it down leg side. Walks off before Dhoni - who looked very convinced - can think of a review"
1.1,"Ngidi to Gayle, no run","beaten. Ngidi gets some sharp climb across the corridor as Gayle gets stuck in the crease, fishing away from the body"
0.6,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","length ball outside off, slices it straight to point on the up"
0.6,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 wide",short ball well down leg side. Can't get bat on the pull
0.5,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","here we go! KL Rahul celebrates immeidately. Full outswinger outside off and he gets close to it, head above the ball, to squeeze this through cover"
0.4,"Chahar to Rahul, no run",good length with some shape away in the corridor. Leans in and guides the forward defence to point
0.3,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","short of a length just outside off, drops it behind point with soft hands"
0.2,"Chahar to Rahul, 2 runs","short of a length on leg stump, flicked late, very fine to Harbhajan's right at long leg"
0.1,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","length ball hooping away in the corridor, defended solidly into the covers"
19.3,"Patel to Bumrah, OUT","it's all over! Mumbai are eliminated from IPL 2018. A slower ball outside off from Harshal and Bumrah just chips a catch to long-on. Boult takes the catch. Glum, glum faces in the Mumbai dugout as their campaign ends in the final hurdle before the playoffs."
19.2,"Patel to Cutting, OUT","and taken! That was a very brave delivery from Harshal and he gets away with it. A short and slow wide delivery outside off. Cutting had walked across, looking to drag the swat over midwicket but because he has to reach out for it so much, he's not in control of the stroke. He picks out deep midwicket. No relay catch this time. A terrific cameo from Cutting though."
19.1,"Patel to Cutting, SIX runs",a short delivery down leg and Cutting smashes that for SIX. That's the worst ball you can bowl. Short and slow down leg and Cutting just helps it along over short fine leg for six. WOW. Mumbai still in this.
18.6,"Boult to Markande, OUT","he misses a full toss. A full toss on off that is very quick, Markande misses it and the ball knocks off stump"
18.5,"Boult to Cutting, 1 run","well bowled. A wide yorker ends up as a low and wide full toss, sliced to deep backward point for one."
18.4,"Boult to Cutting, 2 runs",a full toss outside off is badly hit to deep cover for a couple. Cutting wanted to hit that over long-off but the ball skewed away.
18.3,"Boult to Markande, 1 run","Shaw misses the stumps at the batsman's end, with Cutting not even in the picture. A full delivery is driven to short cover. Shaw takes aim and throws the ball wide. Boult cannot believe it. Cutting back on strike. Pant made the attempt to come front and gather, but fell over while collecting. He needs some time to gather himself."
18.2,"Boult to Markande, no run","not easy for a No. 9. A good length delivery on middle, goes over the stump after Markande misses a dab."
18.1,"Boult to Cutting, 1 run","excellently bowled. A wide yorker outside off, jammed to long-off."
17.6,"Plunkett to Markande, no run","good length outside off, an open-faced dab to third man. Cutting refuses the single."
17.5,"Plunkett to Cutting, 1 run","a nice low full toss outside off, driven to long-on for a run"
17.4,"Plunkett to Cutting, no run","the change in length works. A short offcutter outside off, beats Cutting's pull."
17.3,"Plunkett to Cutting, FOUR runs","hang on to your hats! This ain't done just yet. Full and straight, an offcutter, he picks it and drills the ball over his partner's head. Fierce power over Markande, through long-on"
17.2,"Plunkett to Cutting, SIX runs","that's maaaaaassive! Wheeee. Big hit from Cutting. Now there is time to take it easy too. Full and straight, right in the slot for Cutting, who stays upright and then lofts the ball over long-on. Lovely hit"
17.1,"Plunkett to Cutting, FOUR runs","gets it past short fine leg for four. Some claps in the Mumbai dugout. A slower ball down leg, flicked away past short fine leg. Well played."
16.6,"Boult to Cutting, 1 run","a low full toss down leg, worked down to short fine leg. He picks up and fires, but misses at the batsman's end. Out if he hit"
16.5,"Boult to Cutting, SIX runs","picks that and launched over long-on. A slower ball outside off, Cutting waits and waits before heaving that over midwicket"
16.4,"Boult to Cutting, 2 runs","falls short of Harshal Patel! A slower ball down leg, flicked away in the air towards deep backward square leg. He runs to his right but can't quite get there"
16.3,"Boult to Cutting, no run","a slower ball outside off, a big swing and miss from Cutting."
16.2,"Boult to Markande, 1 leg bye","good length down leg, off the pad down towards leg gully."
16.1,"Boult to Cutting, 1 run","full outside off, driven to long-off for a run"
15.6,"Lamichhane to Markande, 2 runs","googly down leg, worked to deep midwicket for a couple. 3 for 36 for Lamichhane"
15.5,"Lamichhane to Markande, no run","the googly on leg, 88 kph. Markande doesn't read that and pats the ball back to the bowler"
15.4,"Lamichhane to Markande, no run","very full outside off, driven to cover. Mumbai going nowhere."
15.3,"Lamichhane to Markande, no run","flat on off, defended into the off side."
15.3,"Lamichhane to Markande, 1 wide","drifts down leg, was there some pad or thigh pad on that? The umpire calls it a wide"
15.2,"Lamichhane to Cutting, 1 run","flat outside off, chopped to point for a run"
15.1,"Lamichhane to Cutting, no run","flat and straight, pushed out towards cover"
14.6,"Mishra to Markande, no run","short and wide, carved to backward point"
14.5,"Mishra to Pandya, OUT","is that Mumbai done? Mishra and Iyer embrace! Lovely bowling from Mishra, tossed that up well outside off. Hardik Pandya looks to go for the big slog down the ground but it was wider outside off so he isn't quite in control of that. The ball takes the leading edge and lobs to backward point. Mumbai on the brink of elimination."
14.4,"Mishra to Pandya, no run","full delivery outside off, driven to cover"
14.3,"Mishra to Cutting, 1 run","a googly outside off, patted towards cover for one"
14.2,"Mishra to Cutting, no run","looking for the fine paddle sweep, was very slow from Mishra, the ball climbs past the paddle sweep"
14.1,"Mishra to Cutting, no run","flat on middle and leg, pushed towards cover."
13.6,"Patel to Pandya, no run","a short delivery on leg, Pandya walks across and looks to flick the ball fine, but fails to make contact. Over leg stump that was."
13.5,"Patel to Rohit Sharma, OUT","and again! Maxwell and Boult combine for another relay catch! A full delivery around off, Rohit stays in his crease and lofts the ball towards long-on. Maxwell runs to his left again takes a good catch again and throws the ball back to Boult again, who walks in from long-off. Maxwell has a complaint about the ease of Boult's catches with him doing all the hard work."
13.4,"Patel to Rohit Sharma, no run","full and straight, patted back towards mid-on"
13.4,"Patel to Pandya, 2 wide",good stop by Pant! Harshal drifts well down leg for a wide. Pant gets across to his left and stops four extras
13.3,"Patel to Pandya, no run","131 kph, quick outside off, a good length delivery, creeps under Hardik's bat"
13.2,"Patel to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full outside off, flicked to long-on for a run"
13.1,"Patel to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","a slower ball outside off, worked in the gap for two, at midwicket"
12.6,"Boult to Pandya, FOUR runs","poor delivery. Drifts down leg and Hardik flicks the ball very fine, past backward square leg for four."
12.5,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full and wide outside off, driven to deep cover."
12.4,"Boult to Pandya, 5 runs","overthrows! Four? Short and wide outside off, hit to Iyer at cover, who takes aim and throws at the non-striker's end. The backing-up from deep midwicket isn't very good, Harshal runs around from square leg and attempts to keep the ball in the field of play, fails to do so. The umpire calls five overthrows, shouldn't it be four overthrows? That's absurd."
12.3,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slower ball down leg, worked to deep midwicket"
12.2,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","the wide yorker outside off, Rohit opens the bat face and guides the ball through backward point for four."
12.2,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","a slower, very wide delivery outside off is called"
12.1,"Boult to Pandya, 1 run","good length, on the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
11.6,"Lamichhane to Pandya, 1 run","well bowled. Flat around off, pushed to cover for a quick single. Rohit puts in a dive and makes the single despite some quick work from Pant."
11.5,"Lamichhane to Pandya, no run","the googly on off, clipped to midwicket"
11.4,"Lamichhane to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut away to backward point for a run"
11.3,"Lamichhane to Pandya, 1 run","leg side-ish, and flicked away easily to the deep midwicket fielder"
11.2,"Lamichhane to Pandya, FOUR runs","four more! Flat and wide outside off, Hardik drills a drive past cover for four more. Lots of power on that."
11.1,"Lamichhane to Pandya, SIX runs","got underneath that sufficiently! Lots of flight on that, around off. Hardik clears his front leg and slogs the ball easily over long-on for a massive six."
10.6,"Mishra to Pandya, 1 run","quick and straight, pushed away to long-on. Six off the over"
10.5,"Mishra to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","shortish outside off, punched away to long-on for a run"

10.2,"Mishra to Pandya, no run","the flat dart on off, Hardik gets forward and blocks"
10.1,"Mishra to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","flat outside off, tapped in front of point for a run."
9.6,"Lamichhane to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","another googly outside off, driven to deep cover for one."
9.5,"Lamichhane to Pandya, 1 run","a very full delivery outside off, driven to long-on"
9.4,"Lamichhane to Krunal, OUT","chipped to cover! And Mumbai are collapsing, like RCB yesterday. A googly again outside off, Krunal just drives loosely and finds short cover. Very loose hands, just throwing his hands at the ball."
9.3,"Lamichhane to Krunal, no run","googly outside off, the ball beats the bat."
9.2,"Lamichhane to Krunal, FOUR runs","a googly down leg, Krunal sweeps that very fine for four. The fielder runs around and misfields. Surprise, surprise. This time the fielder is Harshal"
9.1,"Lamichhane to Pollard, OUT","sensational stuff from Maxwell and Boult! Boult has taken tougher ones than this, but this was Maxwell's catch. A legbreak around middle and leg, the ball was exceptionally full so Pollard went straight, full face and flat. Maxwell runs around to his left and takes a reverse-cupped catch, but he's falling over so he just throws the ball to Boult nonchalantly, running in from long-off. The best thing about that catch was that Boult ran towards Maxwell when the ball was in the air, realised very early what was at stake."
8.6,"Mishra to Lewis, OUT","Mishra strikes again! Follows that up with a terrific googly, but it's wider outside off. Lewis doesn't read the variation, he just runs down and slogs across the line. Mishra's wiles ensure the ball is short enough to allow room for turn and bounce to beat the slog. Pant does the rest."
8.5,"Mishra to Lewis, SIX runs","not the best line. It's another googly but well down leg, Lewis top-edges this slog sweep and gets it behind square. Enough timing and power for six, lands on the boundary cushion."
8.4,"Mishra to Pollard, 1 run","a flatter one down leg, worked to deep midwicket"
8.3,"Mishra to Lewis, 1 run","a low full toss outside off, drilled to long-off"
8.2,"Mishra to Lewis, no run","the big slog sweep, goes past Lewis. Lots of flight on that googly and Lewis can't make contact"
8.1,"Mishra to Lewis, no run","a googly down leg, worked to midwicket"
7.6,"Plunkett to Pollard, 2 runs","back of a length on middle, worked to deep square leg where guess who misfields. Shaw again. When your confidence is low, things never go your way, but he has only himself to blame. Extremely sloppy cricket."
7.5,"Plunkett to Lewis, 1 run","strays down leg, worked to deep backward square leg for one"
7.4,"Plunkett to Lewis, no run","hit on the side of the helmet! A short slower ball around off and Lewis is through his shot too early. Because he's early through it, the side of the helmet meets the ball, and the ear! Needs some treatment, maybe a new helmet too."
7.3,"Plunkett to Pollard, 1 run","dropped again! This is a much tougher chance, but dropped nonetheless. Full outside off, a thick outside half travels to backward point's left. Abhishek Sharma leaps to his left, but can't catch as the ball bursts out."
7.2,"Plunkett to Lewis, 1 run","a shorter delivery down leg, pulled to deep backward square leg."
7.1,"Plunkett to Lewis, no run","full and straight, pushed to cover"
6.6,"Mishra to Lewis, 1 run","very quick down leg, swept away powerfully to deep backward square leg"
6.5,"Mishra to Lewis, no run","flat and straight, pushed back to the bowler."
6.4,"Mishra to Pollard, 3 runs","Prithvi Shaw having a shocker! An eaaaaasssy catch dropped. A flighted legbreak outside off, Mishra has done Pollard in all ends up. So he goes after a slog sweep, gets a thick outside edge at head height to slip. The ball just goes through his fingers, and then he looks at the ball, doesn't even go after it. Very sloppy work."
6.3,"Mishra to Pollard, no run","goes right through! The googly outside off, Pollard gets forward and prods but the ball finds a massive gap between bat and pad. Does not hit the stumps"
6.2,"Mishra to Pollard, no run","starts with a googly, down leg. Pollard misses a flick. Struck on the pad."
6.1,"Mishra to Ishan, OUT","strikes first ball does Mishy! Kishan picks out long-on. The first ball after the time-out too. He picked that ball to attack well, ran to the pitch of the legbreak and launched a swat to long-on. Shankar runs around the boundary nicely, to his left, and takes a good reverse-cupped catch with his feet inches away from the boundary."
5.6,"Plunkett to Ishan, 1 run","out again with a direct hit. Short outside off, slapped to mid-off for a single. The bowler picks up neatly but misses at the non-striker's end."
5.5,"Plunkett to Lewis, 1 run","too straight again, worked to deep square leg"
5.4,"Plunkett to Ishan, 1 run","138 kph, full on middle and off, punched to mid-off"
5.3,"Plunkett to Ishan, no run","good length on middle and leg, the ball seaming back in. A defensive block to extra cover"
5.2,"Plunkett to Lewis, 1 run","strays on the pads, doesn't want to offer room. Clipped to deep square leg"
5.2,"Plunkett to Lewis, 1 wide","down leg again, another wide."
5.1,"Plunkett to Ishan, 1 run","good length on off, tapped towards backward point for a run"
5.1,"Plunkett to Ishan, 1 wide","a slower ball drifts down leg, wide."
4.6,"Maxwell to Lewis, SIX runs","six to finish the over! Lots of flight on off, Lewis comes down and hits it straight again. Full face, loads of power over long-off"
4.5,"Maxwell to Lewis, FOUR runs","short and down leg, Leiws works the ball easily over square leg. Got underneath the ball enough"
4.4,"Maxwell to Lewis, no run","again, this is much flatter through, smashed to cover"
4.3,"Maxwell to Lewis, no run","flat and wide outside off, punched to cover"
4.2,"Maxwell to Lewis, SIX runs","six more! Lewis on fire. Flat outside off, Lewis steps out and nails a lofted drive right back. Over the bowler's head"
4.1,"Maxwell to Lewis, no run","flat outside off, pushed to cover. Kishan is sent back, makes it back with a full-length dive"
3.6,"Patel to Lewis, 1 run","that's an awful over. A 122 kph slower ball, but it's wide outside off. He can bowl that now because there is a sweeper cover in place."
3.5,"Patel to Lewis, SIX runs","and smashed over midwicket! 128 kph, a short delivery outside off, sits up for Lewis at that pace and walloped with the cross bat."
3.4,"Patel to Lewis, FOUR runs","poor delivery again. It's full and wide outside off, right in the slot to loft the ball over cover. Iyer can't chase it down either. The length is not very good."
3.3,"Patel to Ishan, 1 run","full outside off, tapped down to third man off the open face"
3.2,"Patel to Lewis, 1 run","dropped! Full and wide outside off, smashed through to cover. About knee height for Vijay Shankar. The ball just pops out and goes to Iyer at a straighter cover. Iyer picks the ball and misses the stumps at the bowler's end, well out had Iyer hit. Boult does the backing up."
3.1,"Patel to Lewis, FOUR runs","poor ball. Overpitched outside off, drilled away through cover with so much ease. No hassle at all."
2.6,"Maxwell to Lewis, 1 run","flat and straight, Lewis skews a lofted drive away towards midwicket via the inside half."
2.5,"Maxwell to Ishan, 1 run","darted in, quick, worked to long-on"
2.4,"Maxwell to Lewis, 1 run","shortish and wide outside off, swatted towards cover, who lazily fields and allows one"
2.3,"Maxwell to Lewis, no run","three dots! Lots of flight on that as well, defended"
2.2,"Maxwell to Lewis, no run","nicely bowled again, full outside off, defended to cover"
2.1,"Maxwell to Lewis, no run","flat around off, chopped towards extra cover"
1.6,"Boult to Ishan, no run","terrific over from Boult, short outside off. Kishan tries to lace a cut through backward point but makes no contact"
1.5,"Boult to Ishan, no run","138 kph, full and straight, more away movement, chipped towards mid-on from the crease."
1.4,"Boult to Ishan, no run","too full this time, on middle, blocked to mid-on"
1.3,"Boult to Ishan, no run","beauty! A full delivery on middle, it straightens after pitching, towards off. Kishan is drawn into a leg-side stroke, which is why he's opened up as he defends"
1.2,"Boult to Ishan, no run","back of a length, and slightly wide outside off, cut to backward point"
1.1,"Boult to Lewis, 1 run","a short delivery outside off, swinging away, pulled away through midwicket for a run."
0.6,"Lamichhane to Ishan, no run","googly, on middle and off. Kishan gets forward and defends to cover."
0.5,"Lamichhane to Lewis, 1 run","a googly outside off, worked to midwicket"
0.4,"Lamichhane to Yadav, OUT","12 runs and a wicket in the opening over so far! Lamichhane strikes, a googly down leg, Suryakumar looks to work the ball through midwicket but a leading edge carries all the way to Shankar at long-on. He ran in quite a bit and took a good catch."
0.3,"Lamichhane to Yadav, 2 runs","just over cover! He hit that with the spin. A legbreak outside off, Suryakumar gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over the infield."
0.2,"Lamichhane to Yadav, SIX runs","4 and now 6. Another poor delivery, short and on the pads. Suryakumar stays low and pulls the ball over backward square leg for six."
0.1,"Lamichhane to Yadav, FOUR runs","oh that's tripe to start. A short legbreak, a filthy long-hop on middle and the batsman pulls merrily over midwicket"
19.6,"Cutting to Abhishek, 1 bye","swings and misses, they scamper a bye. Daredevils have ended well."
19.5,"Cutting to Shankar, 1 run",slaps this slower delivery to long-off
19.4,"Cutting to Shankar, SIX runs","launched straight back over, this smashes into the sightscreen. Massive strike, right in his hitting arc. Shankar got the timing right this time. Can't bowl length. Held his shape superbly, held pose for the cameras later."
19.3,"Cutting to Abhishek, 1 run","toe-ends a slog, went midwicket, got this to point. They scamper a run"
19.2,"Cutting to Shankar, 1 run","lofted, but on the bounce to long-on. No timing again"

19.1,"Cutting to Shankar, 1 wide","full and angling wide, Shankar looks to reach out and slice this over but misses."
18.6,"Bumrah to Shankar, 1 run","high full toss, was it above the waist? He's thumped this to Rohit, who hurts his left shoulder in trying to attempt the catch. He's not wincing in pain but is in some discomfort. The physio attends to him immediately.  Another drop "
18.6,"Bumrah to Shankar, 1 wide","slips this down leg, he looked to tickle this fine but missed."
18.5,"Bumrah to Abhishek, 1 run","squeezes this yorker-length delivery back past the bowler, to long-on"
18.5,"Bumrah to Abhishek, 1 wide","aims for a yorker at the base of leg stump, gets it wrong, even if not too far away. Wide called by Dharmasena"
18.4,"Bumrah to Shankar, 1 run","misses the yorker, turns out to be a half-volley that is drilled to sweeper cover."
18.3,"Bumrah to Abhishek, 1 run",makes room and lofts this inside-out to long-off.
18.2,"Bumrah to Shankar, 1 run","sliced over, just eludes Rohit, who runs to his right from short third man.  Goes down as a dropped chance nevertheless . Slower and fuller from Bumrah, Shankar had to reach out to play this one"
18.1,"Bumrah to Abhishek, 1 run","too full on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
17.6,"Mustafizur to Abhishek, 1 run",squeezes this yorker-length delivery outside off towards mid-on
17.5,"Mustafizur to Abhishek, 2 runs","sliced over cover, on the bounce to Ewin Lewis. Could he have gone for the catch? Looks like Lewis bailed out"
17.4,"Mustafizur to Abhishek, SIX runs","that is sensational from the Under-19 boy! This is too short, he lines himself up properly and muscles this pull into the second tier. He's all of 17 but the shape and his timing is just magnificent. Crisp, clean strike against one of the better death bowlers."
17.3,"Mustafizur to Shankar, 1 run","walks across to pull, mistimes it towards Rohit coming in from deep midwicket"
17.2,"Mustafizur to Shankar, no run","punches this straight to extra cover, big mix up with the running. Shankar was a long way down when he was sent back, a direct hit at the striker's end by Hardik and he would've been gone."
17.1,"Mustafizur to Abhishek, 1 run","length angling away, steered towards point"
16.6,"Krunal to Abhishek, 1 run",flicks this low full toss on middle and leg to deep midwicket
16.5,"Krunal to Pant, OUT","holes out to long-on. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball, went through with the lofted it, but no elevation. Straightforward catch to Pollard. End of a magnificent innings."
16.4,"Krunal to Pant, 2 runs","sees him winding up and fires this full and wide, Pant reaches out for a wallop, loses his shape, balance but somehow manages to skews it into the gap at sweeper cover."
16.3,"Krunal to Pant, no run","fires one into the blockhole, Pant somehow manages to jam his bat down to keep it out."
16.2,"Krunal to Pant, no run",slapped to the man at the edge of the ring at extra cover.

15.5,"Pandya to Pant, no run","looks for the reverse lap, gave away his intention too early. missed it"
15.4,"Pandya to Pant, SIX runs","one-handed whack, sails over deep midwicket! At the moment, he can even bat blindfolded and hit them for sixes, by the looks of it. Slower, too full and he got underneath that to muscle that away. Magnificent, unbelievable"
15.3,"Pandya to Pant, 4 leg byes","slips a length ball down leg, Pant helps this along to beat short fine leg. Off the thigh pad, missed the bat. Races away."
15.2,"Pandya to Pant, no run","hit on the pad to a full delivery he looks to whip over midwicket, but this pitched miles outside leg, and hit him outside leg as well. Thank god for DRS, that was a horrendous decision from umpire CK Nandan."
15.1,"Pandya to Pant, SIX runs","now he shows he can reverse pull as well! This one sails over third man. Helped of course by the length, too short. Pant had enough time to change his blade, half-stance and of course help that over. Raises the half-century stand"
14.6,"Mustafizur to Shankar, FOUR runs","slashes, but gets a thick edge that runs wide of the keeper to the third man boundary"
14.5,"Mustafizur to Pant, 1 run","belted back down the ground, Fizz can't stop this on his followthrough, deflects it to long-on.  Pant's fifth 50 plus score in seven innings.  This one off 34 balls"
14.4,"Mustafizur to Pant, no run",driven firmly to mid-off. Bowled this full and slanted this across to Pant
14.3,"Mustafizur to Pant, 2 runs","belts this to hit Fizz flush on the toe as it deflects towards mid-on. They scamper back for the second because of the overthrow.  Fizz takes his left shoe off, awkward landing as well because he twisted his left leg "
14.2,"Mustafizur to Pant, SIX runs"," that's a one-handed wallop , dragged it from outside off to a slower ball, but it just sailed over wide long-on. Massive from Pant."
14.1,"Mustafizur to Pant, no run","shaped to slog this deep into the stands at cow corner, got the bottom-edge that rolled to the leg side."

10.5,"Cutting to Pant, 1 run","too short, uses the width to punch to sweeper cover"
10.4,"Cutting to Pant, no run","slower ball, looked work to the leg side but ends up offering a dead bat."
10.3,"Cutting to Shankar, 1 run","length angling into middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket"
10.2,"Cutting to Shankar, no run","closer to the stumps at length, dabbed to short third man. Pant refused the run. Could've so easily been another mix-up"

9.3,"Pandya to Shankar, no run",dabs this gently to point
9.2,"Pandya to Shankar, FOUR runs","uses the pace and then times this to perfection. Short third man had no chance. Short, hint of width and Shankar just laced it away."
9.1,"Pandya to Pant, 1 run",pulled down to deep midwicket
8.6,"Markande to Iyer, OUT","oh, dear. He's hit this straight down the throat of deep midwicket. Too short, he picked the correct ball to pull, a googly, pulled but didn't connect as well as he would've liked. Krunal was mindful of the ropes behind him. He was no more than an inch or two in front of the ropes. After a promising start, Iyer has ended the season with a string of ordinary performances."
8.5,"Markande to Pant, 1 run",reaches out to slap this short delivery to sweeper cover
8.4,"Markande to Iyer, 1 run",steps out and works this to short midwicket where Mustafizur misfields to give away a single
8.3,"Markande to Pant, 1 run","turns this gently to square leg, sensible"
8.2,"Markande to Pant, FOUR runs","this is tremendous! There's deep midwicket and deep square, but he bisects the field again. Goes back deep into the crease and whip-pulls this. Strong bottom hands as well. Timed magnificently"
8.1,"Markande to Pant, no run","slides one away, Pant looks at Dharmasena in anticipation of a wide, but not given and rightly so."
7.6,"Cutting to Pant, 1 run","pulled from outside off to square leg, no control over the stroke, so no timing. Rohit hits direct at the striker's end, but there's no real danger of Iyer being out there because he was comfortably in."
7.5,"Cutting to Pant, no run","back of length angling away, Pant stands tall and punches this to cover."
7.4,"Cutting to Iyer, 1 run","dabs this gently into the off side, towards short third man, as they jog the single"
7.3,"Cutting to Pant, 1 run",slaps this short delivery straight to sweeper cover
7.2,"Cutting to Pant, FOUR runs","delightful wrist work. There's point, short third man. It's short, so Pant adjusts slightly to pick the gap between the two. Superbly done. Cut away in style, didn't bother keeping this down because he knew he was hitting this in the gap"
7.1,"Cutting to Iyer, 1 run","length on middle and leg, knocked to deep midwicket."
6.6,"Markande to Pant, SIX runs","steps out, gets to the pitch of the ball to smother it and whips this over deep midwicket, his favourite scoring area. That's the first six of the match."
6.5,"Markande to Iyer, 1 run",flat-bats this short ball to long on
6.4,"Markande to Pant, 1 run","wrong'un at length, dabbed gently to short third man for a quick single"
6.3,"Markande to Pant, FOUR runs","too short and sliding down, Pant pulls this with the spin to beat deep backward square. Valiant effort from Ewin Lewis. Poor from Markande"
6.2,"Markande to Iyer, 1 run",gets right to the pitch of the ball as he eases this to sweeper cover
6.1,"Markande to Pant, 1 run","touch short on middle and leg, worked behind square on the leg side for an easy single"
5.6,"Mustafizur to Iyer, no run","beaten! Another cutter, a typical Mustafizur special. Iyer poked at it with an angled bat."
5.5,"Mustafizur to Iyer, no run","through the pull even before the short of length cutter arrived, on the bounce to Ishan Kishan."
5.4,"Mustafizur to Iyer, no run","driven but can't pick the gap, straight to cover point."
5.3,"Mustafizur to Pant, 1 run",dabbed to short third man for a quick single
5.2,"Mustafizur to Pant, 2 runs","full and sliding into the pads, flicked superbly into the gap towards deep backward square leg."
5.1,"Mustafizur to Pant, FOUR runs","delightful from Pant. Picks the length, stands tall and punches this between cover and point. What timing, special stroke. Who said his game's just about biffing the ball? Held the pose for the cameras too!"
4.6,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run",punches this wide of mid-on to get off the mark.
4.5,"Bumrah to Pant, no run","short of length delivery slanting away, defended from the crease."
4.4,"Bumrah to Pant, no run",gets half a stride in and defends this back towards the bowler.
4.3,"Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT"," right through, 144kph.  Maxwell's forgettable IPL is over. Bumrah gives him the silent treatment. Maxwell went for a glory hit, trying to belt this up and over his head. But the ball angled back in to sneak in off a big inside edge and flatten leg stump. This is the fourth time Bumrah has dismissed Maxwell."
4.2,"Bumrah to Maxwell, no run",bit of an inside edge onto the pad as he looked to hoick this over midwicket. Stifled appeal from Bumrah
4.2,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide","looks to pull, but is beaten for pace. Angling down leg, wide called."
4.1,"Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR runs","goes downtown, one bounce to the long-off boundary. Spotted the change in pace, but this was too full and he got to the pitch and have it a whack. Picked the slower delivery immediately."
3.6,"Mustafizur to Maxwell, 1 run",works this to short fine leg for a quick single
3.5,"Mustafizur to Maxwell, no run","hits the hard length, on middle. Defended to extra cover."

3.2,"Mustafizur to Maxwell, 1 run",stands tall and punches this to cover point.
3.1,"Mustafizur to Maxwell, OUT","what laziness, Shaw was taking a Sunday stroll and has to walk back. Defended to point by Maxwell, he called no and turned back immediately. Shaw was no more than four or five yards outside the crease even as Pandya threw the ball direct at the bowler's end. This is very poor, lack of game awareness. He didn't even make an attempt to get back in. Completely taken aback by Hardik Pandya's throw. Virender Sehwag like."
2.6,"Pandya to Shaw, FOUR runs","pulled behind square. Nice timing, once he beat short fine, he was always assured of a boundary. Too short, Shaw fetched it from outside off."
2.5,"Pandya to Maxwell, 1 run",works this off his hip to deep square leg
2.4,"Pandya to Maxwell, FOUR runs","punchy drive, beats mid-off. No chance for Krunal even though he was no more than a couple of yards away from the ball. That just kept gathering speed."
2.3,"Pandya to Maxwell, no run","slower and fuller outside off, Maxwell takes a step across as he looks to whack this over cover, played too late. On the bounce to Ishan Kishan."
2.2,"Pandya to Shaw, 1 run","wallops this short ball up and over the ring, but there's long-on specifically for that kind of stroke from Shaw"
2.1,"Pandya to Shaw, no run","back of length on off, Shaw gets on top of the bounce and defends back."
1.6,"Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR runs","too short and drifting into middle and leg, Maxwell waits and then tickles this fine off his hip to beat short fine leg."
1.5,"Bumrah to Maxwell, no run",right back in the crease as he defends this incoming length ball to midwicket
1.4,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 2 runs",works this length ball on middle and leg towards deep midwicket.
1.3,"Bumrah to Shaw, 1 run","punches this length ball behind point, down to Krunal at square third man"
1.2,"Bumrah to Shaw, FOUR runs","slashed, too quick for Suryakumar Yadav at slip. By the time he cupped his hands, the ball had flown past him at first slip. Tough, tough chance."
1.1,"Bumrah to Shaw, no run","angles in a full ball on off from wide of the crease, defended solidly."
0.6,"Krunal to Maxwell, FOUR runs","swung away, not in control but manages to hoick this behind square on the leg side. First boundary"

0.3,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run","touch short on middle, tucked towards short midwicket"
0.2,"Krunal to Maxwell, 2 leg byes","drifts in, rolls off the thigh pad to short fine as Maxwell attempts a tickle. Oh, dear. Overthrow from Bumrah at the bowler's end, they get an extra run"
0.1,"Krunal to Shaw, 1 run","short and drifting into middle and leg, whipped to backward square leg to get off the mark. Tumbling stop there by Surya, I think. Little wide and that was four."
19.4,"Brathwaite to Karthik, 1 run","low full toss on middle, and that's been tapped to long on. KKR qualify into the IPL playoffs! Celebrations in the KKR dugout. Hugs in the camp."
19.3,"Brathwaite to Karthik, no run","slower ball, and outside off stump. Attempts the drive but deceived by the pace. Goes past his bat's outside edge"
19.2,"Brathwaite to Rana, OUT","good length on off, and Rana succumbs! Tries to play the pull, but he's mistimed it to fine leg. Bhuvneshwar the man there. Drama?"
19.1,"Brathwaite to Rana, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off, but Rana manages to find the boundary! Reaches at it, but manages to drill this cut past point. Deep point's dive is futile. Scores are tied"
18.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, no run","yorker on off, and that's been squeezed away to point. DK wants the single, but no chance. KKR need five off the final over to secure playoff qualification"
18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, 1 run","full on of, and Rana backs away to make some extra room. Drives through the cover region. Man in the deep though"
18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and this time he manages to drag the pull to deep midwicket"
18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, no run","good length outside off, and angling slightly away after pitching. Tries to pull, but the ball goes under his bat. Through to Goswami"
18.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, 2 runs","full on off, and pushed off the front foot to the midwicket region. No one's there, so long on has to give it a big chase. Enough time to sneak in the second run"
18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, 1 run","yorker on leg stump, but ends up as a very low full toss. Clipped off his boots to deep backward square"
17.6,"Kaul to Rana, 1 run","yorker just outside off, and that's been played with the bat's open face. Glanced to deep point"
17.5,"Kaul to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, and punched off the front foot to sweeper cover. Easy pickings"
17.5,"Kaul to Karthik, 1 wide","slower ball, full outside off. Too wide, says the umpire"
17.4,"Kaul to Russell, OUT","full just outside off, and Russell winds up for a big slog. Tries to send it over long off, but toe ends it this time. In the air for ages, and mid off settles under it"
17.3,"Kaul to Russell, FOUR runs","back of a length on middle, and Russell ain't done trying to pull.Connects this time, and top edges it to fine leg. Good effort by Sandeep at fine leg, but the scoreboard won't show that. Diving effort, but dropped"
17.2,"Kaul to Russell, no run","short on middle, and Russell makes room to pull it away. Misses again!"
17.1,"Kaul to Karthik, 1 run","full, but wide outside off. Forced to reach at it, but still manages to drive it safely past the cover region. Man in the deep"
16.6,"Brathwaite to Russell, no run","back of a length on off, and Russell goes for a wild swing of the bat. Misses completely"
16.5,"Brathwaite to Karthik, 1 run","full toss outside off, and muscled to the wide long-on boundary for a single"
16.4,"Brathwaite to Karthik, FOUR runs","pulled with disdain! Back of a length outside off, and DK picks the slower ball early. Thumps it to the cow-corner boundary thereafter. Flat, and one bounce four"
16.4,"Brathwaite to Karthik, 1 wide","full outside leg, but goes down as a wide. Karthik did try to flick it fine, but can't get bat to ball"
16.3,"Brathwaite to Uthappa, OUT","falls to the pull once again! Wide outside off, but short. And that sends Uthappa chasing after it. Top-edges it, and Goswami runs towards square-leg to complete the catch. Brathwaite does the 'Run D World' dance"
16.2,"Brathwaite to Karthik, 1 run","heavy ball. Full outside off, and driven square to the man in the deep. Easy single"
16.1,"Brathwaite to Uthappa, 1 leg bye","full on leg stump, and the batsman some room on the leg side. Tries to play it towards midwicket, but misses. Hits his pads and goes towards short cover instead"
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run","leading edge! But falls in no man's land. Full on off, and he tries to flick it towards the leg side. Goes to cover point instead. Final time out of the night"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, SIX runs","huuuuuuuuge! Full on off, and he brings his front leg to the pitch of the ball, before depositing it over wide long on. Rashid's in disbelief"
15.4,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, FOUR runs","full just outside off, and this time Uthappa manages to read the turn. Picks the legbreak, and then smashes it over Rashid's head"
15.3,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 1 run","full outside off, but it's the googly! Sharp turn into the batsman, and he tries to defend. Takes the bat's inside edge, and then onto his pads"
15.2,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 2 runs","full on off, and pushed to wide mid on off the front foot. Forces the bowler to chase behind it, which allows the KKR batsmen to complete the second run"
15.1,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball on off, and he tries the reverse paddle. Plays it uncomfortably to short third man"
14.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, 2 runs","almost a yorker outside off, but DK manages to drive it to cover. They're taking the quick run, and KW's throw gets the direct hit. But the batsman's in, and now they take another run"
14.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, 2 runs","good length, but wide outside off. Plays it away from his body, but still manages to punch it beyond the fielder at cover. In the air for a while"
14.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, SIX runs","length ball on middle, but angling down the leg side. Karthik swivels, and then drags it over the fine-leg boundary. Seventy-seven metres!"
14.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, no run","back of a length outside off, and he mistimes the pull to midwicket. Good stop by the infielder"
14.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, no run","full on off, and defended back to the bowler. He wants the single, but turns back eventually. Bhuvi, though, picks up the ball and has a shy at the stumps. Breaks it, but the batsman had dragged his bat in"
14.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, and whipped off his pads to deep backward square"
13.6,"Kaul to Karthik, no run","good length outside off, and angling into him. Carved off the back foot to cover point, but the non-striker sends the batsman back"

13.4,"Kaul to Karthik, 1 run","good length on off, and shaping into the batsman. Fended with soft hands towards the cover region, and he's off for a quick single"
13.3,"Kaul to Karthik, no run","length ball outside off, and DK tries to glance it fine past the keeper's right. But can't get bat to ball, and the delivery sneaks past the outside of his bat"
13.2,"Kaul to Karthik, no run","full on off, and angling into DK. Tapped to midwicket"
13.1,"Kaul to Lynn, OUT","full on off, and in his arc! Lynn swings through, and hits it flat to wide long-on, but Pandey's in the deep! Takes the catch, but lobs it up as he's going over the line, then comes back, and finally completes the catch. Classic T20 catch"
12.6,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","full outside off, and he's down on one knee to sweep it to the man at deep backward square"
12.5,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 2 runs","full, but wide outside off. Driven along the ground to Dhawan at deep extra cover"
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball outside off, and punched to the cover region"

12.1,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, no run","the reverse sweep doesn't come off. Full outside off, and Uthappa goes unconventional"

11.5,"Shakib to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball on off, and worked off his pads to the vacant midwicket region"
11.4,"Shakib to Uthappa, FOUR runs","deft! Best of both words from Uthappa. It was full outside off, but Uthappa uses the depth of the crease to bring out the late cut. Goes between point and short third man"
11.3,"Shakib to Uthappa, SIX runs","full on off, and in Uthappa's arc. Big stride forward, and struck over the man at long on. Classic Robin!"
11.2,"Shakib to Lynn, 1 run","full on middle, but straightens after pitching. Lynn thumps it straight, between the umpire and the non-striker, to long on"
11.1,"Shakib to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball on off stump, and Uthappa makes some room. Attempts to lift it over cover, but slices this over the infield instead"
10.6,"Sandeep to Lynn, no run","length ball on off, and slapped off the back foot to cover"
10.5,"Sandeep to Lynn, SIX runs","slower ball outside off, but Lynn's been waiting for that length ball. Lines it up, gets his front leg away, and then slogs it over the long-on boundary. Fifty! Ninety-six metres"
10.4,"Sandeep to Uthappa, 1 run","full just outside off, and Uthappa check drives over Lynn's head. A chip actually, which saves him. Lands just short of long on"
10.3,"Sandeep to Uthappa, 2 runs","good length on off, and Uthappa shuffles across to the off side. Works it behind square this time, and calls early for the second run"
10.2,"Sandeep to Uthappa, no run","back of a length outside off, but the ball stays low! Uthappa considered pulling that square, but checks his shot at the end. Lets it go to Goswami on the bounce"
10.1,"Sandeep to Lynn, 1 run","yorker on off, and that's been dug away well. Managed to get his bat down and squeeze it towards the off side"

9.5,"Shakib to Lynn, no run",full on off and drifting into Lynn's pads. Fended off the front foot
9.4,"Shakib to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball on off, and he backs away to carve it to sweeper cover. Uthappa wants the second, but Lynn does well to end him back. Would've been harakiri"
9.3,"Shakib to Lynn, 1 run","overpitched just outside off, and that's been muscled down the ground past Shakib's left. Long off's there though"
9.2,"Shakib to Uthappa, 1 run","flatter, and full outside off. Pushed off the front foot to cover point by Uthappa"
9.1,"Shakib to Lynn, 1 run","length ball outside off, and allows Lynn to free his arms. Cuts it to point, and the fielder can't hold on to it. Allows them to complete the run"
8.6,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","drops it short on middle stump, pulled to deep square"
8.5,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run","dropped off his own bowling. Uthappa goes with the slog sweep and gets it off the toe-end. It hangs high in the mid-on area. He's running backwards and looks to be in a bad position as it comes down. Swerves away from him as he follows it and bounces back off the turf to hit him in the face. Not an easy chance, that one"
8.4,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","length outside off, swept along the floor to long leg"
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, no run",trapped on the pads but they won't review the not-out decision. It's a googly that he tries to whip behind square off the back foot. Hits him on the back foot at middle-and-leg .did they think it was going down?
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run",plans the reverse sweep and gets outside the line of off stump to set up for it. But it's a googly and it takes the inside edge before dribbling past the keeper on the leg side
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","length ball wide outside off, gets down and sweeps to long leg"
7.6,"Brathwaite to Lynn, 1 run",short of a length and angled into the corridor. Backs away and under-edges a cut towards mid-off

7.4,"Brathwaite to Lynn, 1 run","yorker on leg stump, tapped into the mid-on region"
7.3,"Brathwaite to Lynn, no run","short ball outside off, backs away and is so eager to wallop this behind point, he ends up losing his shape at the last moment and missing it"
7.2,"Brathwaite to Lynn, SIX runs",mistimed slog over deep midwicket. Length ball slanted into him. Gets outside the line of leg stump and lifts it 87 metres. Yep. Off the inside half.
7.1,"Brathwaite to Lynn, no run","length ball at off stump, defended off the back foot"
6.6,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 2 runs","length ball on middle stump, gets on the front foot and flicks to deep midwicket"
6.5,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, no run",cramped and a big appeal.  Not out - on lbw and caught. Googly ripped in at Uthappa who was set up for a back foot punch. It's off his thigh to first slip
6.4,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","googly at a length outside off. Shuffles, gets the front foot press in and flicks this into the midwicket region"
6.3,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run",short of a length and spinning away outside off. Gets on the back foot and pushes to sweeper cover
6.2,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","length ball just outside off, pokes it through cover off the front foot"
6.1,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, no run","length ball, skidding through rapidly and spinning away outside off. An obligatory waft, beaten"
5.6,"Kaul to Uthappa, no run","bouncer dug in too short for him to attempt a shot. Looked higher than head-height from the front view, but play on says the umpire"
5.5,"Kaul to Uthappa, FOUR runs",graceful. Uthappa springs up quickly after his forward press and lifts this pull shot neatly over midwicket. Full control.
5.4,"Kaul to Lynn, 1 run",low full toss at middle stump. Drives inside-out but can't beat mid-off to his left
5.3,"Kaul to Lynn, no run","low full toss outside off, mistimed flick straight to midwicket"
5.2,"Kaul to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, slices to third man who is very fine"
5.1,"Kaul to Uthappa, no run","length ball on the pads. Looks to flick it fine, but can't get bat. According to everyone but the keeper, who collects and appeals excitedly. No review. Yeah, it's off the pad"
4.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, 1 run",in the air but down to third man. Anxious jab with hard hands at a length ball outside off and it's a thick outside edge
4.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run","under edge through to the keeper on the bounce. Short ball outside off, gets too close as he tries to cut"
4.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run",good length outside off. Leans in to try and jab off the front foot. Thick inside edge to midwicket
4.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, 1 run","short of a length outside off, backs away and chops to sweeper cover"
4.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, 1 wide","bouncer outside off, lets it go after making room. That got a little too steep after he'd set up for it"
4.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, FOUR runs",misses the length this time and is punished. With some force. Overpitched this time on off stump and Lynn drills this between bowler and mid-off
4.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, no run",yorker. Perfect. Lynn can't do more than get his front toe out of the way and dig this out
3.6,"Shakib to Uthappa, no run","tossed up on off stump, defended solidly on the front foot"
3.5,"Shakib to Lynn, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, punched firmly to long-off"
3.4,"Shakib to Narine, OUT",gets him this time. Slightly shorter and a similar slow pace from Shakib. Narine beaten in flight again and this time it's off the inside half of the bat as he looks to slog. Pandey runs in and completes the catch easily
3.3,"Shakib to Narine, SIX runs",clears long-on. Slogs this high. He's beaten in flight a tad but has enough reach to get it off the middle and just get it over Pandey
3.2,"Shakib to Narine, FOUR runs",poor ball. Dragged very short and Narine waits for it to come on before spanking it to the square leg boundary
3.1,"Shakib to Lynn, 1 run","tossed up full outside off. Lynn through the cover drive early, gets an inside edge that tickles through square leg"
2.6,"Kaul to Lynn, 1 leg bye","overpitched ball on the legs, but he can't get bat on this. Looks to flick and can only pick up a leg bye with the deflection"
2.5,"Kaul to Lynn, no run",yorker on middle stump. Backs away again and is forced to jam this to mid-off
2.4,"Kaul to Lynn, FOUR runs",thumped over mid-off. The line and length is predictable - short of a length and in at the body. Lynn backs away in anticipation. Gets a knuckle ball that sits up nicely
2.3,"Kaul to Lynn, no run","short of a length at middle stump, pushes it into the off side from the crease"
2.2,"Kaul to Lynn, SIX runs","swatted away! Not connected too well, but this is Lynn, and this is the norm. Clears the ropes easily. Short ball into the body and he gets the slog out quickly"
2.1,"Kaul to Lynn, no run",kncukle ball that floats away at an off stump line. Lynn solidly behind the line to defend off the back foot
1.6,"Sandeep to Narine, SIX runs",clears the long-on boundary! Sandeep has gone for 20 in his first over. A slower ball. Narine looks like he knows it's coming. Steps out and meets it at the pitch in front of middle stump before launching it flat to long-on's right
1.6,"Sandeep to Narine, 1 wide",now he misfires the yorker. Pushes it down leg side from around the wicket
1.6,"Sandeep to Narine, 1 wide","slower ball, short and skidding down leg side. He steps out and swings at it. Can't hit"
1.5,"Sandeep to Narine, no run",full outside off and bunted straight to mid-off
1.4,"Sandeep to Narine, FOUR runs","over extra cover. Finally gets one off well, somewhere close to the middle. Length ball outside off, swings clean under this and opens the face a touch to get it off the outside half of the bat"
1.3,"Sandeep to Narine, FOUR runs","inside edge this time. Length ball skidding in at leg stump. Steps out and swings at it, gets runs wide of short fine"
1.2,"Sandeep to Narine, FOUR runs",clears point with a mistimed slice. Narine wants to thump this over over but it's a slower ball drifting away from him and it takes the thick outside edge
1.1,"Sandeep to Narine, no run",wide bouncer first up. Narine goes after it but is too slow to get bat on it
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, FOUR runs",whack. Poor ball and he slaps it away. Short of a length with a lot of width. It's well in front of cover
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, 1 run","how did you do that Narine? Ridiculous stuff! An inswinging yorker coming in at middle stump. He opens his stance, and digs it out to third man from less than a yard in front of the stumps"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, 1 run","nicely played but can't get it past mid-off. Outswinger, full and wide outside off. Leans in and drives firmly, right off the middle of the bat"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, FOUR runs",chopped away easily. Short of a length and some width outside off. Lynn stays shuffles back a little and bisects cover and point
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, no run","short of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, no run","big inswinger to start. But it's a tad short of good length. Lynn keeps it out, taps it back to the bowler"
19.6,"Prasidh to Bhuvneshwar, OUT","back of a length on off, and he fails to connect with the short ball! The batsman's trying for a suicidal run, and DK throws down the stumps. The fourth wicket of the over! Sunrisers finish on 172 for 9"
19.5,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, OUT","back of a length outside off, and he tries to send this over cover! The slog finds the bat's outside edge, and that's a skier! Rana's at fine leg, but DK has called for the catch. Takes it from almost near the boundary, and then falls over due to the momentum. Fourth wicket for Krishna!"
19.4,"Prasidh to Shakib, OUT","good length on off, and too close to his body for the pull. Comes off the bat's top half, and Narine's under it at short fine leg. Great death-overs bowling from the youngster"
19.3,"Prasidh to Shakib, FOUR runs","creamed! Full outside off, and allows Shakib to free his arms. Drills this drive to the extra-cover boundary. Oof, what sound off the bat"
19.2,"Prasidh to Shakib, no run",pinpoint yorker on leg stump. The batsman did well to get his toes out of the way
19.1,"Prasidh to Pandey, OUT","full toss outside off, and that's been slogged towards the leg side. It's a flat shot, but Rinku Singh, the substitute, displays some excellent athleticism in the deep. Slides and takes a diving catch running forward. Prasidh applauds!"
18.6,"Russell to Shakib, no run","full and wide outside off. But a well-aimed yorker. Shakib tries to ramp it past short third man, but misses. DK collects and that's well done by Russell"
18.5,"Russell to Shakib, no run","good comeback! Short on off, and going over Shakib's shoulders. He tried to ramp it over DK, but can't get bat to ball"
18.4,"Russell to Shakib, FOUR runs","slower ball, but a length ball. Shakib settles deep into his crease, and pulls it over the square-leg umpire!"
18.3,"Russell to Shakib, 2 runs","full on leg stump, and that's the short arm jab from Shakib. Excellent timing off the bat, but the fielder in the deep puts in the hard yards"
18.2,"Russell to Pandey, 1 run","full outside leg, and he backs away before inside-edging an on drive to deep backward square"
18.1,"Russell to Brathwaite, OUT","back of a length on off, and that's way too quick for Carlos. Tried to pull, finds the top edge. DK races forward and completes a comfortable catch. Russell wins the battle of the West Indians"
17.6,"Prasidh to Brathwaite, 1 run","a yorker on leg stump, and Brathwaite manages to get enough behind that to play it down the ground. Long off cleans up"
17.5,"Prasidh to Pandey, 1 run",back of a length outside off. He backs away and punches it square to the man in the deep
17.4,"Prasidh to Pandey, SIX runs","full on middle, and he gets his front foot out of the way to get his bat swinging. Muscles it over wide long on thereafter!"
17.3,"Prasidh to Brathwaite, 1 run","attempted yorker on leg stump, and that's been inside-edged to the square-leg fielder"
17.2,"Prasidh to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, but angling into Pandey. He checks his punch, and glances it towards backward point on this occasion"
17.1,"Prasidh to Pandey, no run","almost a yorker on middle, that he tries to play the straight drive to. The shot ricochets onto his boot and then goes to the bowler's hands. Prasidh's asking for the catch! They're going upstairs, but the ball actually hit the ground before hitting Pandey's boots. False alarm"
16.6,"Narine to Pandey, 1 run","full outside off, and driven to cover point off the front foot. They'll take the run"
16.6,"Narine to Pandey, 1 wide","quicker ball on leg stump, but that's too wide. Extras"
16.5,"Narine to Brathwaite, 1 run","good length on off, and offspin from Narine. Whipped towards midwicket off the back foot"
16.4,"Narine to Pandey, 1 leg bye","good length on middle, and turning towards the leg side. Clipped off his hips to short fine leg on this occasion"
16.3,"Narine to Pandey, no run","good length outside off, and enough width for him to play the late cut. Played with soft hands, but well intercepted by short third man!"
16.2,"Narine to Pathan, OUT","full on off, and in Pathan's slot. Goes for a big one, but toe-ends it unfortunately. Mid on, Uthappa, settles under it, and holds on to this catch. Narine strikes!"
16.1,"Narine to Pandey, 1 run","good length on off, and turning into his pads. Worked towards the deep square-leg fielder"
15.6,"Prasidh to Pandey, 1 run","slower ball to end the over. But wide outside off, which allows him to free his arms. Thumps a cut to the man in the deep"
15.5,"Prasidh to Pathan, 1 run","good length on middle, and once again worked off his hips to fine leg. Chawla the fielder there"
15.5,"Prasidh to Pathan, 1 wide","short! On off, but always going over the batsman's head. Extras"
15.4,"Prasidh to Pandey, 1 run","length ball on middle, but angling down the leg side. Pandey flicks, and helps it on its way to fine leg"
15.3,"Prasidh to Pathan, 1 run","width offered outside off, and that's been cut off the back foot. Beats point, but third man does well to clean up"
15.2,"Prasidh to Pathan, no run","back of a length outside off, and that's been fended from near his face. Tapped to the cover region"
15.1,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, OUT","given! Slower ball, on off stump, and Dhawan misses the big slog towards the leg side. Deceived by the lack of pace, and the ball hits his front leg. Impact in front of middle, and Gabbar's gotta go. Time out as well"
14.6,"Russell to Pandey, FOUR runs","full on middle, and this time he drills a drive past extra cover. Oh dear, a basic fielding error by Chawla at wide long off. Makes a mess of a fielding opportunity in the deep, and gifts Sunrisers some extra runs"
14.5,"Russell to Pandey, no run","back of a length, slower ball. Pandey tries to cut it over point, but he's completely deceived! Goes through to DK"
14.4,"Russell to Pandey, no run","short on middle, and that's fiery! Pandey hops across to the leg side in a bid to get away from the ball's line"
14.3,"Russell to Pandey, FOUR runs","full just outside off, and that's been whipped! Great use of the wrists, and placed excellently to the cow-corner region"
14.2,"Russell to Pandey, no run","good length on off, and Pandey opens his bat's face, but finds the man at point once again"
14.1,"Russell to Pandey, no run","short and wide outside off. Starts off with the offcutter, and Pandey mistimes a cut to point"
13.6,"Kuldeep to Pandey, 1 run","full outside off, and wide enough for Pandey to free his arms. Drills this drive to sweeper cover"
13.5,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length on middle, but sharp turn away from Dhawan. Flat-bats it to long off and completes his fifty!"
13.4,"Kuldeep to Pandey, 1 run","full on off, and turning away from him. Defended towards short cover"
13.3,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","full on leg, and Dhawan clips it off his pads to deep backward square"
13.2,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, no run","good length on off, but the wrong'un comes into Dhawan's pads. Tapped towards the leg side"
13.1,"Kuldeep to Pandey, 1 run","flighted on middle stump, and comfortably driven past the non-striker to mid off"
12.6,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Pandey, 1 run","starts off with a late cut. Length ball outside off, which he pokes to the fielder at short third man"
12.5,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Williamson, OUT","back of a length outside off, and Williamson's forced to reach at it. Goes for the cut anyway, and he's perhaps timed it way too well! Straight to Russell at deep point, and the slower ball fetches Searles the big wicket!"
12.4,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Williamson, 2 runs","length ball outside off, and this time it's been muscled to the man at cow corner. Took the pace off, Searles"
12.3,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Williamson, SIX runs","different angle, but the same result! Oh dear, KKR are losing the plot aren't they. Full outside leg, and Williamson gets down on one knee and paddles this over fine leg once more"
12.2,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Williamson, SIX runs","visionary! Williamson exposes his leg stump even before the ball was bowled. And when it pitched on leg stump, KW just whips it off his pads, and sends it over the fielder at fine leg!"
12.1,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to S Dhawan, 3 runs","Narine drops it! In the air for ages, but it was one that swerves a lot. Full on middle, and Dhawan's leg-side whip was skied towards the off side. Rana, however, has the presence of mind to aim at the stumps. It's broken the bails, but also allows Sunrisers to steal an extra run"
11.6,"Narine to Williamson, 2 runs","length ball on off, and Williamson shuffles across to the off side and nudges it to the square-leg region. Played with gentle hands, and that actually allows them to take the second"
11.5,"Narine to S Dhawan, 1 run","full on middle, and he's down on one knee to sweep it behind square! Prasidh Krishna manning that region"
11.4,"Narine to Williamson, 1 run","full on off, and pushed off the front foot to mid off"
11.3,"Narine to Williamson, no run","full on middle, but turns sharply into his pads. KW can't get bat to ball, and it hits his pads. Impact on leg stump, but would've gone down the leg side"
11.2,"Narine to Williamson, no run","full on off, and straightens after pitching. Defended off the front foot"
11.1,"Narine to Williamson, 2 runs","on middle, and angling into his pads. Williamson pushes it off his pads to the vacant square-leg region, and there's enough time to come back for the second"
10.6,"Kuldeep to Williamson, 1 run","length ball outside off, and then turning into KW. Cut off the back foot to the man in the deep"
10.5,"Kuldeep to Williamson, 2 runs","good length on middle, and it's the wrong'un this time. But Williamson drags it off the backfoot to deep midwicket with ease"
10.4,"Kuldeep to Williamson, SIX runs","over wide long on! Flighted on middle and leg, but Williamson comfortably gets his front leg out of the way and then thumps it towards the leg side. Too slow from Kuldeep, which gives the batsman that extra second"
10.3,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","full on leg stump, and that's been clipped off his toes to cow corner. Gets KW on strike"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Williamson, 1 run","nice, juicy full toss outside off, but Williamson can't put it away. Miscues a drive to mid off"
10.1,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length on off, and turning away from Dhawan. Drags his shot to deep midwicket for a jogging run"
9.6,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 1 run","half-tracker on off, and pulled along the grass to deep midwicket"
9.5,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 2 runs","misfield! Allows SRH to take another run. Full on middle, and the batsman comes down the wicket. Misses the slog, but manages to play it to backward square. The infielder can't collect"
9.4,"Chawla to Williamson, 1 run","full just outside off, and driven down the ground to long off for a jogging single"
9.3,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 1 run","full on middle, and the front-foot defense finds his outside edge. Goes to short third man, but that doesn't stop the batsmen from stealing a single"
9.2,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 2 runs","good length on off, and turning away from Dhawan. He punches it away from his body, but finds the man at deep extra cover"
9.1,"Chawla to Williamson, 1 run","on middle, and angling into his pads. Rocks onto the back foot and punches it past the non-striker to long on"
8.6,"Kuldeep to Williamson, 1 run","good length on off, and turning away from the batsman. Nudged to the cover-point region, and calls it early for a run"
8.5,"Kuldeep to Williamson, FOUR runs","length ball on middle, and Williamson bends his knees and then pulls this along the ground to the square boundary. Perfectly placed"
8.4,"Kuldeep to Goswami, OUT","flighted again, but this time he gets his dancing shoes on. Comes down the wicket, and tries to slog it over long on, but can't get the distance. Taken at long on!"
8.3,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","flighted on leg stump, and Dhawan pushes it nochalantly to the long-on region. Comfortable single"
8.2,"Kuldeep to Goswami, 1 run","on middle, and turns it off the back foot to the midwicket region. Calls early for the single"
8.1,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","ooo, googly! Full on middle, and turning into the batsman. Chops it towards the leg side for a quick run"
7.6,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length on off, and this time the pull has been dragged to the sweeper fielder on the leg side. They jog across for the run"
7.5,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Goswami, 1 run","full toss, but very wide outside off. Goswami mistimes the cut to sweeper cover for a solitary run"
7.4,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length outside off, and that's been whipped off the back foot to the vacant midwicket region. Searles goes chasing behind it, picks it up, and has an aim at the striker's end. Misses."
7.3,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Goswami, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and angling into the batsman. He backed away to make some extra room, so the bowler did well to follow him. Punched towards cover with soft hands"
7.2,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Goswami, 2 runs","good length outside off, and he backs away to slap this cut past the infield. Enough time to take the second run as well"
7.1,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Goswami, no run","wild! Short on leg stump, but going down the leg side. He's lucky that the batsman had shuffled across to the leg side as well. Hits his shoulder guard and goes to the keeper"
6.6,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","good length on off, and Dhawan goes deep into his crease this time. Pulls it along the ground in front of square, and that shot eventually beats wide long on! Ends the over with a boundary"
6.5,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, no run","pitches outside leg, but spins across the batsman's body. Defended"
6.4,"Kuldeep to Goswami, 1 run","flighted on middle and off, and Goswami attempts the late cut. Mistimed to short third man this time"
6.3,"Kuldeep to Goswami, FOUR runs","flighted on leg stump, and he plays the reverse sweep! That audacity. Quick to adjust his position, and then drags the shot behind square"
6.2,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","full on off, but turns into Dhawan this time. Cuts it to cover point for a quick run, but he played that shot from very close to his body. Always a dangerous option"
6.1,"Kuldeep to S Dhawan, no run","flat on off, and turning away from the batsman. Flat-batted back to Kuldeep off the back foot"
5.6,"Narine to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to long-on off the back foot"
5.5,"Narine to S Dhawan, no run","short and wide outside off, looks to cut and is beaten on the outside edge"
5.5,"Narine to S Dhawan, 1 wide","length ball down leg side, misses on the sweep"
5.4,"Narine to S Dhawan, no run",short of a length on leg stump and pulled straight to midwicket
5.3,"Narine to S Dhawan, SIX runs",so simple. Gets to the pitch and calmly lofts this over long-on with a clean swing. Narine doesn't get grip or turn outside off because of that big stride
5.2,"Narine to Goswami, 1 run","short of a length outside off, opens the face and runs it to short third man"
5.1,"Narine to Goswami, no run",short of a length and cramping him. He pushes it back down the pitch
4.6,"Chawla to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","guides it past short third man. Chawla made to pay for his leg stump line. It's full, it's fast enough - Dhawan shovels it past the fielder"
4.5,"Chawla to Goswami, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven down to long-on"
4.4,"Chawla to Goswami, 2 runs",loopy length ball outside off. Goswami reaches out for the aerial drive over off side but doesn't get to the pitch. Just manages to clear cover with the chip
4.3,"Chawla to Goswami, no run","short of a length on the stumps, tapped into the leg side with soft hands"
4.2,"Chawla to Goswami, FOUR runs","through Uthappa! He's expecting this slice from Goswami to turn to his right at extra cover, but it goes straight after pitching a couple of yards in front"
4.1,"Chawla to Goswami, no run","short of a length slider outside off, cut into the turf off the under-edge"
3.6,"Narine to S Dhawan, no run","full at middle stump, pushed back to the bowler off the front foot"

3.3,"Narine to Goswami, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, dabbed to short third man"
3.2,"Narine to Goswami, no run","well fielded. Overpitched ball outside off, bludgeoned off the front foot but Rana lunges to his right and stops one-handed at cover point"
3.1,"Narine to S Dhawan, 1 run","tossed up at off stump, gets on his knee and drills it along the floor to long-off"
2.6,"Russell to Goswami, FOUR runs",smart. Very smart batting from Goswami. He's dismantled Russell. Leaps to cover the bounce of another short one in the corridor and caresses it between point and backward point
2.5,"Russell to Goswami, 4 byes",short ball clears Karthik! This explodes from the pitch. He bangs it into the corridor and it keeps on climbing after passing the batsman
2.4,"Russell to Goswami, FOUR runs",opens up the off side again! Superb stuff from Goswami. This one is overpitched on off stump and he uses the room to slice it through cover point
2.4,"Russell to Goswami, (no ball)","good bouncer but it's the second one! Free-hit coming up. Russell wins the battle, following Goswami down leg side with this bouncer, but it's come at a cost"
2.3,"Russell to Goswami, SIX runs","oh glorious! Goswamu backs away and launches this length ball from his stumps far, far over extra cover! That is classy. Uses his wrists to open the face at the perfect moment"
2.2,"Russell to Goswami, no run","has him with the bouncer. The batsman has reviewed though, after what seems like a top-edge has been taken at slip .it's off the helmet. Got in an awful position for the hook. So bad, in fact, that the bat isn't anywhere near the ball. Thumps the top of the helmet and hangs up for Rana. No damage to the batsman from that impact. Life's good."
2.2,"Russell to Goswami, 1 wide",attempted offcutter lands on a length but is down leg side
2.1,"Russell to Goswami, no run",length ball in the corridor and he's into the punch too early. Hits the inside half of the bat and rolls back to the bowler
1.6,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, no run","good length just outside off, pushed into the covers on the up"
1.5,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, no run","length ball on middle stump, punched back at the bowler on the up"
1.4,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",just evades Uthappa's hand at backward point. Short-ish again and Dhawan slices hard from underneath. Uthappa stretches to his right and can't hold on
1.3,"Prasidh to Goswami, 1 run",bouncer at leg stump. Gets on top of the bounce nicely and drops it pitch side with soft hands
1.3,"Prasidh to Goswami, 1 wide",looks for the full inswinger. It starts at leg stump and goes down
1.2,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, squares him up as he goes on the back foot. Thick outside edge down to third man"
1.1,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",poor start. Short and wide and slanted across Dhawan. We've seen him long enough to know what that means. Spanks it over backward point
0.6,"Rana to S Dhawan, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, drops it into the covers with soft hands to pinch the single"
0.5,"Rana to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length just outside off, sudbued flat-batted drive straight to extra cover"

0.3,"Rana to S Dhawan, no run","length ball on off stump, tapped to extra cover off the back foot"
0.2,"Rana to S Dhawan, no run",another short of a length ball hooping in sharply at off stump. Dhawan chops straight to short third man
0.1,"Rana to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",short of a length ball skidded into the man he calls bhaiyya in the Delhi Ranji team. Bhaiyya stands tall and slaps it to the cover boundary
19.2,"Unadkat to Siraj, OUT","swung away, but this is a steepler towards deep midwicket. Sanju Samson is running IN, K Gowtham is running back from the ingield, the ball curves in the air and as it comes down, Samson oses balance and fumbles, but Gowtham has the presence of mind to take this on the rebound. Stunning win for the Royals.  Bangalore boys Gowtham and Gopal have booted RCB out of IPL 2018. "
19.1,"Unadkat to Siraj, FOUR runs","reverse paddled past short third man. Lost his balance, was made to look ungainly but somehow connected. If he missed, would've been plumb in front of middle."
18.6,"Archer to Chahal, no run","looks to back away and loft, can only get the bottom of the bat, rolls back to the bowler."
18.5,"Archer to Chahal, no run","looks to muscle this short ball, toe-ends it and it rolls wide of the pitch"
18.4,"Archer to Chahal, no run","superb yorker angled in towards the base of leg stump, Chahal somehow manages to keep that out"
18.3,"Archer to Siraj, 1 run","hit back hard but Archer stops it with his boot, they'll scamper a run nonetheless"
18.2,"Archer to Siraj, no run","walks across to ramp this over short fine leg, beaten as he had no pace to work with."
18.1,"Archer to Chahal, 1 leg bye","full ball that tails in to beat his defence, there's an appeal for lbw. In the meanwhile, the non-striker hares across to force Chahal into the bye. Klaasen fires a throw at the bowler's end, a direct hit and Chahal would've been gone."
17.6,"Unadkat to Southee, OUT","he's got more elevation than distance, would've been six at Chinnaswamy but the boundaries in Jaipur are huge. Swung away and Gowtham takes a simple catch off the toe end at wide long-on."
17.5,"Unadkat to Southee, no run","slower length ball outside off, deviates away. Southee heaves but can't connect."
17.4,"Unadkat to Siraj, 1 run","lofted, but on the bounce to sweeper cover"
17.3,"Unadkat to Southee, 1 run","full toss, swung across to the leg side off the inside edge, down to deep square"
17.2,"Unadkat to Southee, FOUR runs","walks across the stumps, holds his shape and hoicks this slower ball into the gap at deep midwicket"
17.1,"Unadkat to Siraj, 1 run","slower length ball from around the stumps, squeezed to point for a quick single"
16.6,"Archer to Southee, FOUR runs",full toss and he steps out to wallop this over mid-off. Clean strike
16.5,"Archer to Siraj, 1 run",flicked neatly down to deep square leg.
16.5,"Archer to Siraj, 1 wide","slower length ball but way outside off, Siraj looked to upper cut but let it go. Two bounces to the keeper."
16.4,"Archer to Southee, 1 run","thick inside edge onto the pad, rolls to the off side for a single"
16.3,"Archer to Southee, no run","full toss which angles in as he looks to flick, beaten. Hit high on the pad."
16.2,"Archer to Southee, no run","wild heave across the line to a slower length ball, beaten."
16.1,"Archer to Siraj, 1 run","squeezes the drive to cover, a direct hit at the bowler's end from Rahane and he would've been gone"
15.6,"Laughlin to Siraj, 1 run","driven firmly to cover, Rahane misfields but it wouldn't have mattered because they've taken a single anyway"
15.5,"Laughlin to Siraj, FOUR runs","he's walloped this pull to deep square. Too short, Siraj had decided he'll pull no matter what. Hit it cleanly too."
15.4,"Laughlin to Siraj, no run","shapes to squeeze this yorker outside off, beaten."
15.3,"Laughlin to Siraj, no run","slower one, dipped on Siraj as he lunges forward and blocks"
15.2,"Laughlin to Yadav, OUT","the middle and off stump has been flattened. Right through Umesh's defence. Hits the hard length this time, he played all around it. Royals roar."
15.1,"Laughlin to Khan, OUT","stunning from Klaasen! Catch of the match. Sarfaraz looks to play a late cut, but strangely to another slower ball. Surely he can't be trying dinky strokes like those without pace to work with? Doesn't matter, he has to go. Klaasen's anticipation is top notch as he moves quickly to his right, dives low and puts his right hand out to pluck that inches from the ground."
14.6,"Unadkat to Southee, no run","pulls too early, misses and the short ball hits him below the helmet grille. Seems okay, and we'll carry on."
14.5,"Unadkat to Southee, no run",steps out to hoick but is deceived by the slower delivery that spins away past the outside edge to the keeper
14.4,"Unadkat to Khan, 1 run","ramps this up and over, but down to third man. Once again didn't have the pace to ramp this fine."
14.3,"Unadkat to Khan, no run","looks for the late dab off this length ball, but had no pace to work with, beaten. On the bounce to the keeper"
14.2,"Unadkat to Khan, FOUR runs",lofted cleanly over mid-off. Picked the length up and went over.
14.1,"Unadkat to Southee, 1 run","length outside off, bunted wide of cover for a quick single"
13.6,"Sodhi to Khan, no run",tucks this with the spin to short fine leg.
13.5,"Sodhi to Southee, 1 run","drives, gets a thick edge again that rolls to Unadkat at short third man."
13.4,"Sodhi to Southee, no run","googly that he lands outside off, Southee lunges forward and blocks"
13.3,"Sodhi to Southee, 2 runs","thick edge past short third man, they scamper back for the second."
13.2,"Sodhi to Southee, no run","beaten on the drive, sharp turn again from Sodhi."
13.1,"Sodhi to Khan, 1 run","touch short, pulled towards wide long on for a single"
12.6,"Gopal to Southee, no run","too full, drills this straight to cover. Brilliant spell from Shreyas"
12.5,"Gopal to Southee, no run",stretches out and defends this tossed up delivery with soft hands.
12.4,"Gopal to AB, OUT","misreads the googly, gone. That could be the final nail in RCB's coffin this season? Class from Shreyas Gopal! Lands this outside off, AB is sucked into the drive, but is done in by the length as well as the ball rips back in to beat the inside edge. Klaasen is alert as he pulls off another superb stumping."
12.3,"Gopal to Khan, 1 run",lunges forward and defends gently into the off side as they scamper a single
12.2,"Gopal to Khan, no run",goes back into the crease and dabs this gently.
12.1,"Gopal to AB, 1 run","touch short outside off, punched to deep point for an easy single"
11.6,"Sodhi to Grandhomme, OUT","shapes to drive, doesn't get to the pitch, is beaten for turn, and gets a thick edge that has been taken beautifully by Rahane at slip. Excellent captaincy to have himself stationed there. Superb from Sodhi. Dragged him forward into the drive, deceived him in flight and thank you very much. RCB slide further."
11.5,"Sodhi to AB, 1 run","drives but the ball holds its line, thick inside edge to square leg."
11.4,"Sodhi to Grandhomme, 1 run","squared up, leading edge that rolls wide of point for a quick single"
11.3,"Sodhi to AB, 1 run",eased with the spin to deep cover as he jogs the single
11.2,"Sodhi to AB, FOUR runs","too short and he gets punished! So the single has now resulted in a boundary that brings up AB's sixth half-century this season. Too short, he stays his ground and flat-bats this into the gap at deep midwicket"
11.1,"Sodhi to AB, 2 runs","tossed up outside off, AB drives to a misfielding Samson at sweeper cover, ran in too quickly and couldn't bend down properly. Gives away an extra single"
10.6,"Gopal to AB, 1 run",rocks back and pulls this short ball to Samson at deep midwicket.
10.5,"Gopal to AB, no run",chops this cut to cover. Sharp turn from length again for Shreyas
10.4,"Gopal to Grandhomme, 1 run",eased with the spin to long off
10.3,"Gopal to Mandeep, OUT","there's the big wicket. Mandeep runs down under pressure to go over the top, beaten by sharp turn and Klaasen executes a straightforward stumping. Superb bowling, nicely tossed up him and deceived him in flight.  Big moment in the match."
10.2,"Gopal to Mandeep, no run","dabs this to short third, looks for a single but is sent back"
10.1,"Gopal to AB, 1 run",works this gently past midwicket for an easy single
9.6,"Sodhi to Mandeep, 2 runs","works this with the spin to long-on, picked the googly off the hand."
9.5,"Sodhi to AB, 1 run","eased with the spin to deep cover, sensibly done."
9.4,"Sodhi to Mandeep, 1 run","leading edge as this rolls to short third man. Mandeep was squared up, looked to work this to midwicket. Sharp turn for Sodhi"
9.3,"Sodhi to AB, 1 run","the googly that rips back in from length on off, worked to deep midwicket"
9.2,"Sodhi to AB, 2 runs","driven nicely into the gap at sweeper cover, back for the second comfortably"
9.1,"Sodhi to AB, no run",steered with the spin to point
8.6,"Gopal to Ali, OUT","he's chipped this back to Shreyas, who leaps high to take an excellent return catch. The double-strike returns to stun RCB, the blue flags are out. The googly has done the trick. He's a short man, but timed his jump superbly."
8.5,"Gopal to AB, 1 run",driven with the spin to sweeper cover
8.4,"Gopal to Ali, 1 run",turns this gently towards square leg with the spin to get off the mark
8.3,"Gopal to Patel, OUT","slides one across, Parthiv shapes to pull but this beats the underedge as he misses. In doing so, he dragged his back foot forward and it was on the line when the bails were whipped off. Stunning work from Klaasen. Parthiv's done his job though."
8.2,"Gopal to AB, 1 run",eased with the spin to long-off
8.1,"Gopal to AB, no run",defended back with the spin to the bowler. Didn't get to the pitch as he looked to loft over
7.6,"Sodhi to Patel, no run","too close to cut, goes through anyway. Can only squeeze this straight to point."
7.5,"Sodhi to AB, 1 run","slides one from length outside off, cut away to deep point"
7.4,"Sodhi to Patel, 1 run","leading edge but eludes the infield, on the bounce to long off. Parthiv looked to stretch out and work this leg side but was deceived by the googly."
7.3,"Sodhi to AB, 1 run","shapes to drive, gets a thick inside edge past midwicket"
7.2,"Sodhi to AB, FOUR runs","to short again, he rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket where Archer makes a mess of it. Did all the hard work in getting to the ball, but as he tried to get up and recover to throw the ball back in, he ended up palming this over the boundary."
7.1,"Sodhi to AB, FOUR runs","welcomes him with a reverse sweep past short third man. Flatter one that spins away from outside off, so AB was hitting it with the spin. Easy, he just helped it along."
6.6,"Gopal to AB, 1 run","length, spins away outside off, whipped to long-on"
6.5,"Gopal to Patel, 1 run",gets the front foot across and whips this fuller one through midwicket
6.4,"Gopal to AB, 3 runs","under edge that gets through first slip. Not sure that carried. Nope, it didn't. Fell just short of him and bounced over him. They take three"
6.3,"Gopal to Patel, 1 run",gets down to sweep a length ball and gets a top-edge through backward square leg
6.2,"Gopal to AB, 1 run","short and wide, cut to sweeper cover"
6.1,"Gopal to Patel, 1 run","pitched up on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
5.6,"Unadkat to Patel, 1 run",opens the face to a back of a length delivery and steers to short third man who dives and gets a hand to it. Stopped a certain boundary
5.5,"Unadkat to Patel, FOUR runs","shot! Extremely full outside off, and Parthiv drills it through extra cover with exquisite timing"
5.4,"Unadkat to Patel, no run",
5.3,"Unadkat to Patel, FOUR runs",dropped. Would have been a stunning catch but Samson gets his hands to it but can't hold on. Samson isn't standing as behind as he'd like. Parthiv swings at this length ball from outside off and crunches it off the middle to deep midwicket where Samson leaps and gets his right hand up but the ball pops out at the last minute
5.2,"Unadkat to AB, 1 run","sees AB back away and drops it at a back of a length on the leg-stump line, and AB pulls it away to square leg"
5.1,"Unadkat to AB, no run","short of a length, backs away and punches to cover"
4.6,"Laughlin to Patel, FOUR runs",swings wildly at this wide fuller ball and gets an outside edge that gets over short third man and carries to the boundary
4.5,"Laughlin to AB, 1 run","leg-side fuller ball, clipped to backward square leg"
4.4,"Laughlin to AB, no run","short of a length, cuts him in half and goes over the stumps after missing the inside edge"
4.3,"Laughlin to AB, FOUR runs","oh, what a shot! Where do you bowl to this man! Advances down the ground and gets right under the ball before crunching it straight down the ground. Got so under it that his nose was over it"
4.2,"Laughlin to Patel, 1 run","full and wide, crunched to sweeper cover"
4.1,"Laughlin to Patel, no run",opens the face to one outside off and misses
3.6,"Archer to AB, FOUR runs","full and angled in, he just has so much time to get in position, and then uses his wrists to flick it through midwicket"
3.5,"Archer to AB, FOUR runs","short of a length, this is a cutter, and AB make sure to give himself enough room, before punching it crisply with loads of timing through extra cover"
3.4,"Archer to AB, no run",tries to force a cut from close to the body and knocks it towards point
3.3,"Archer to AB, no run","length ball, just outside off, tentatively defends into the surface as the ball lands close to the stumps"
3.2,"Archer to AB, FOUR runs","short and angled into him, can't be bowling there to AB, who pulls it away to deep backward square leg"
3.1,"Archer to AB, 2 runs","short of a length on off, gets an inside edge to midwicket"
2.6,"Gowtham to AB, 1 run","full and flat on middle and leg, driven down to long-on"
2.5,"Gowtham to Kohli, OUT","gone, Kohli's gone! This is a huge wicket for Royals. You got the feeling Kohli was playing for the 15.5 over requirement. Charges down the ground to force the pace, not quite full enough and he swipes only for the ball to spin in from a length and flatten the stumps"
2.4,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 bye",backs away and swings wildly at this back of a length delivery and misses. Gets past the keeper as well after missing leg stump
2.3,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run","just back of a length, flat, punched wide of long-on"
2.2,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 run","shortish on middle, curves in and he backs away and whips it to mid-on"
2.1,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run","flat length ball, punched to deep midwicket"
1.6,"Archer to Patel, SIX runs",and again. Archer drops it short to Parthiv who leans back and helps it over the keeper. This time the timing's so good that it carries all the way
1.5,"Archer to Kohli, 1 run","short of good length, cuts into him from outside off and gets an inside edge to the on side"
1.4,"Archer to Patel, 1 run",gets a top-edge to a short ball that drops short of deep midwicket
1.3,"Archer to Patel, no run",backs away to a short of a length ball and swings and misses
1.2,"Archer to Patel, no run",gets an inside edge to a back of a length delivery outside off
1.1,"Archer to Patel, SIX runs","what a shot! Oh, that's stunning. Arches back to a short delivery that climbs outside off and just uses the pace to help it over with a ramp"
0.6,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run",backs away to force a cut but makes no contact and loses balance as the ball nearly shaves off-stump
0.5,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 run",shifts back to a short of a length delivery that curves into him and hurriedly whips it away to the on side
0.4,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run","pitched up outside off, driven down to long-on"
0.3,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run","flat back of a length ball outside off, Kohli fends and gets an inside edge, lucky to not chop on"
0.2,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run",tucked to midwicket
0.1,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run","length outside off that stays low, Kohli shuffles and the ball sneaks from beneath"
19.6,"Southee to Gowtham, OUT","walks across, so Southee fires this full and wide, he can't carve it so decides to scoot a bye. Parthiv flicks the underarm throw to Southee, who breaks the bails at the bowler's end with Gowtham not even in sight."
19.5,"Southee to Gowtham, no run","bowls this full and wide, inside the wide line though as Gowtham leaves."
19.4,"Southee to Gowtham, 2 runs","squeezes this full delivery to short third man, a direct hit at the bowler's end from short third man and Gowtham would've been gone.  As it turns out, they sneak in an overthrow"
19.3,"Southee to Gowtham, SIX runs","too full, too straight and banged over long off. Hitting right out of the top drawer. Reach, height and timing - everything perfect for that stroke."
19.2,"Southee to Gowtham, SIX runs","pulled magnificently. What were you doing inside the dressing room for so long, KG? Goes short and wide, Gowtham is across in a jiffy as he nails this pull in front of square to perfection."
19.1,"Southee to Tripathi, 1 run",squeezes this full length delivery straight to extra cover
18.6,"Siraj to Klaasen, OUT","looks to clear long off, but no timing and Moeen takes a simple catch at the ropes. Klassen backed away, Siraj bowled it full and wide. Slowed the pace down as well, so he couldn't get any timing on that as well despite having a good reach. Useful knock nonetheless."
18.5,"Siraj to Klaasen, no run","sees him backing away and bowls a slower one outside off, Klaasen can't reach this. Nice awareness from Siraj"
18.4,"Siraj to Klaasen, 2 runs","skiddy bouncer, Klassen fetches this pull from way outside off, gets it into the gap between deep midwicket and long on"
18.3,"Siraj to Klaasen, FOUR runs","full toss, he walks across and then scoops this deep into the stands at fine leg. Siraj looked for a yorker, missed his length completely."
18.2,"Siraj to Klaasen, SIX runs","carved away over backward point, clears the ropes. Opened the bat face and then got underneath the full length delivery to put this away. Lovely"
18.1,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run","right into the blockhole, Tripathi backs away and squeezes this to cover"
17.6,"Southee to Tripathi, 1 run","toe-ends a slog to long on, called two but had to pull out as AB came around quickly."
17.5,"Southee to Tripathi, 2 runs",down on one knee as he slogs this to deep midwicket where Kohli covers good ground and then dishes in a dive to stop that. The recovery too was top notch
17.4,"Southee to Tripathi, no run","slower and fuller outside off, Tripathi looked to biff this over midwicket but swung through early and missed."
17.3,"Southee to Klaasen, 1 run","dipping yorker on middle and leg, toe-ends a lofted hit to long on"
17.3,"Southee to Klaasen, 1 wide","backs away to to over the off side, Southee sees this and lands the slower ball wide but gets this outside the wide line. Rolls to Parthiv"
17.2,"Southee to Tripathi, 1 run","too full, yorker length on off, drilled to long-off"
17.1,"Southee to Klaasen, 1 run","right into the blockhole on middle, squeezed to long on"
16.6,"Chahal to Tripathi, no run","drifts in and gets some fizz off the delivery from length on middle, defended back."
16.5,"Chahal to Klaasen, 1 run","top-edges a reverse sweep, can't get it past short third man."
16.4,"Chahal to Tripathi, 1 run","swung across the line, but on the bounce to long on. Dragged it from wide outside off."
16.3,"Chahal to Klaasen, 1 run","hit hard but can't pick the gap, straight to long off"
16.2,"Chahal to Tripathi, 1 run","tossed up on middle and leg, gets to the pitch and whips this to long on"
16.1,"Chahal to Klaasen, 1 run","flatter and fuller on off, Klaasen gets a thick inside edge on the drive past midwicket"
15.6,"Siraj to Klaasen, 1 run","drills this full delivery to wide long-off, doesn't want to chance a second against Kohli's strong arm."
15.5,"Siraj to Klaasen, 2 runs","slower and fuller outside off, slapped to deep cover as they hare back for the second"
15.4,"Siraj to Klaasen, FOUR runs",backs away and punches this length ball on the up between cover and mid-off. Lovely timing.
15.3,"Siraj to Klaasen, FOUR runs","thick inside edge, flies past leg stump into the fine leg boundary. Went for a pull, no position to play it."
15.2,"Siraj to Klaasen, no run","skiddy length ball back in from wide of the crease, Klaasen hops back and defends"
15.1,"Siraj to Klaasen, no run",slips back in to beat the underedge as Klaasen looks to punch on the up.
14.6,"Ali to Tripathi, no run","late cut, but straight to Sarfaraz at short third man"
14.5,"Ali to Tripathi, SIX runs","good, clean strike. Down the ground as he gets to the pitch and lofts it straight into the sightscreen. Magnificent timing and use of the feet"
14.4,"Ali to Tripathi, no run",dabs this gently but straight to short third man
14.3,"Ali to Tripathi, 2 runs","gets outside the line of off and works this to deep midwicket where de Grandhomme misfields to concede the second. Ran in too quickly, then lost his balance as he attempted a one-handed pick-up"
14.2,"Ali to Tripathi, no run",punched back to the bowler. Looked to work it from way outside off towards midwicket
14.1,"Ali to Klaasen, 1 run","flatter on middle, worked wide of midwicket"
13.6,"Yadav to Klaasen, 1 run","full outside off, drilled off the inside of the bat towards mid-on"
13.5,"Yadav to Klaasen, no run","make that three in one over! Umesh is producing another sharp burst of bowling. And this is a stunning delivery. An extremely full ball, curving into him at pace and dipping to hit the pad. Klaasen reviews and could the angle save him here? No, it's actually an inside edge. Clear deflection onto the pad. Top delivery nonetheless"
13.4,"Yadav to Klaasen, 2 runs","length, angled in at off, flicked to the left of deep midwicket"
13.3,"Yadav to Klaasen, no run","short of a length, defended in front of off from the crease"
13.2,"Yadav to Samson, OUT","straight to short midwicket. Umesh again provides RCB with crucial strikes. Royals cannot afford to slow down anymore, and Samson has paid the price for checking his stroke here. Closes the face from outside off to a length ball and the follow-through isn't great as he's caught in two minds. Chips it straight to Moeen Ali"
13.1,"Yadav to Rahane, OUT","swings across the line to heave it over the leg side and gets hit on the pad. Umesh turns around and appeals and the umpire takes a long time to give it. Rahane asks for the review. A little too full for him to attempt that heave with a half-angled bat as the ball sneaks from underneath after keeping a little low. Seems to be be hitting the stumps, but he did take a big stride across which is what could save him. Nah, actually, it's umpire's call on impact"
12.6,"Chahal to Tripathi, 2 runs","again floats it up well away from the batsman, forcing him to reach out for a drive to sweeper cover"
12.5,"Chahal to Tripathi, no run","takes it away from him and spins away, and that's got to be a wide. Tripathi was expecting the call, which is why he let it go. But not called by the umpire"
12.4,"Chahal to Tripathi, 2 runs",comes down the track and goes inside-out to the left of long-off
12.3,"Chahal to Tripathi, FOUR runs","comes down the track and heaves blindly without getting behind the line, gets a thick outside edge that runs away to third man. Nicely done by Chahal to flight it up and draw the batsman forward but taking it away from him"
12.2,"Chahal to Tripathi, no run","length ball on leg, pushed back to the right of the bowler"
12.1,"Chahal to Rahane, 1 run","flat slider on leg, swept to deep square leg"
11.6,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, SIX runs",comes down the track and there is an absolute lack of pace at 103.7kmph. Chips it straight over and the ball crashes on the bounce into the sightscreen
11.5,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 2 runs",skews this short one off the top portion of the bat to deep midwicket. No pace again at 111.7kmph. Fifty for Tripathi
11.4,"Grandhomme to Rahane, 1 run","short around off, tries to pull and gets an under edge to deep square leg"
11.3,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 1 run",cuts very late and finds backward point. Boundaries have completely dried up. They need some desperately
11.2,"Grandhomme to Rahane, 1 run",gives the charge and ends up awkwardly slapping a length ball to long-off
11.1,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 1 run","length, cuts into him at off, punched to wide long-on"
10.6,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run","fullish outside off, driven away to deep point"
10.5,"Siraj to Rahane, 1 leg bye",walks a long way across to paddle this one and gets hit on the pad as it rolls away to short fine leg. Impact outside off. Not too far away though
10.4,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run","short and sitting up nicely on off, pulled to deep midwicket"
10.3,"Siraj to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length, walks across prematurely and pulls it away to deep midwicket"
10.2,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run","full outside off, drilled down to long-on"
10.1,"Siraj to Rahane, 1 run","pacy length ball outside off, uses that pace as he opens the face and runs it down to third man"
9.6,"Grandhomme to Rahane, 1 run","full outside off, flicked away across the line to deep midwicket"
9.5,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 1 run","length on off, whipped away wide of long-on"
9.4,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 2 runs",walks down the ground and waits for this slower one to come on before picking the gap between midwicket and long-on. Pushes back for a quick second
9.3,"Grandhomme to Rahane, 1 run",pats a length ball to midwicket for one
9.3,"Grandhomme to Rahane, 1 wide",this one's the worst of the lot. Way down the leg side. That's three wides in the over
9.2,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 1 run","full and straight on off, crunches a drive to long-off"
9.2,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 1 wide",slid down the leg side again. Poor from de grandhomme
9.1,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 2 runs","fuller ball outside off, slower in pace, and he mistimes the whip between midwicket and long-on. Kohli and Southee converge and Kohli slides and picks it up"
9.1,"Grandhomme to Tripathi, 1 wide",sprays it down the leg side and gets past the attempted glance
8.6,"Yadav to Tripathi, 1 run","shortish outside off, opens the face to third man"
8.5,"Yadav to Tripathi, FOUR runs","full outside off, carved away over the covers. Uppish but through the gap"
8.4,"Yadav to Rahane, 1 run","slower length ball, angling in, tucked away through square leg"
8.3,"Yadav to Tripathi, 1 run","full outside off, leans into a drive to the left of sweeper cover"
8.2,"Yadav to Rahane, 1 run","fullish at off at 144.8kmph, flicked between mid-on and midwicket"
8.1,"Yadav to Tripathi, 1 run","fullish length outside off, driven away to sweeper cover"
7.6,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run",pushes forward early and chips a punch to a length ball that nearly carries to backward point
7.5,"Siraj to Rahane, 1 run","good length outside off, opens the face to third man"
7.4,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run","short and wide, slapped to sweeper cover"
7.3,"Siraj to Tripathi, no run",crunches this length ball to cover where AB dives and saves it
7.2,"Siraj to Tripathi, no run",gets an under-edge that nearly finds the stumps. Too much bounce outside off for him comfort and he can't et on top of it as he tries to pull
7.1,"Siraj to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length outside off, opens the face to third man"
6.6,"Southee to Rahane, 1 run",uses the inwards angle to turn around and guide it to backward square leg
6.5,"Southee to Rahane, no run","too much bounce, catches him off guard and raps him on the pad as he misses the flick. Southee belts out an appeal, but then again, bounced too much"
6.4,"Southee to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length at 132.9ks on middle stump, pulled away to backward square leg"
6.3,"Southee to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length, cuts into him, whipped off the pads to deep backward square leg"
6.2,"Southee to Tripathi, 1 run","full and straight on off, drilled down to long-on"
6.1,"Southee to Rahane, 1 run","short of a length, tucked around the corner to deep fine leg"
5.6,"Chahal to Tripathi, no run","sharp turn from middle, he goes back and defends back"
5.5,"Chahal to Rahane, 1 run",wrong'un which he gently nudges towards midwicket for a quick single
5.4,"Chahal to Rahane, no run","pushed through quicker on off, defended with soft hands to the off side"
5.3,"Chahal to Tripathi, 1 run","drifts this in fuller on middle and leg, worked wide of short midwicket"
5.2,"Chahal to Tripathi, FOUR runs","shortens his length, Tripathi quickly transfers his weight back and slaps this through midwicket"
5.1,"Chahal to Tripathi, FOUR runs","steps out, gets outside leg and then lofts this inside-out over cover. Magnificent"
4.6,"Southee to Tripathi, 1 run","steps out and hammers this down the ground, AB dives full stretch to his right at mid-off to save a certain boundary"
4.5,"Southee to Rahane, 1 run",angles this slower delivery down to third man
4.4,"Southee to Tripathi, 1 run","nips back in from outside off, firmly defended between cover and point"
4.3,"Southee to Tripathi, 2 runs","looks to biff this pull, no timing and just manages to get it into the gap at midwicket. Hit the top part of the bat"
4.2,"Southee to Rahane, 1 run","slower length ball on off, worked across to square leg"
4.1,"Southee to Rahane, FOUR runs","whipped superbly. Beats deep square leg. Lovely wrist work. Just a touch short from Southee, Rahane used the depth of the crease superbly to put that away."
3.6,"Yadav to Tripathi, FOUR runs","short-arm jab, gets it up and over midwicket. This kept a touch low but the timing was superb. Fetched the pull from outside off."
3.5,"Yadav to Rahane, 1 run","pulled, but not in control. Gets this wide of mid-on"
3.4,"Yadav to Rahane, FOUR runs","right in the slot, thumped over the bowler's head. No chance for mid-on. Lovely followthrough as he picked the length up"
3.3,"Yadav to Rahane, no run",right behind the line of the length ball as he defends.
3.2,"Yadav to Rahane, FOUR runs",Lovely timing! Opened the bat face late to ease this behind point. Pure timing
3.1,"Yadav to Rahane, no run",punched straight to point
2.6,"Ali to Tripathi, no run","goes through him! Sharp turn to beat the inside edge and hit the pad. Big appeal from Parthiv, nearly four appeals. Moeen joined in late. May have been missing leg stump. RCB don't review Moeen hinted to Kohli that it may have gone down leg."
2.5,"Ali to Tripathi, no run","sharp turn from length outside off, defended back"
2.4,"Ali to Tripathi, SIX runs","gets outside the line of the stumps and sweeps this with the spin over deep backward square leg. The big stride was the key, neatly executed."
2.3,"Ali to Rahane, 1 run","drifts in a quicker delivery on middle and leg, eased to long on"
2.2,"Ali to Rahane, 2 runs","turns this gently towards the man coming in from mid-on, aggressive running. Misfield from Chahal"
2.1,"Ali to Tripathi, 1 run","touch short, he rocks back and pulls to AB at deep midwicket"
1.6,"Yadav to Rahane, no run","beaten by a beautiful away-swinger! Leans to drive, no feet and simply goes through with hard hands, done in by late swing. Zips through to the keeper."
1.5,"Yadav to Rahane, no run",gets half a stride in as he defends this length ball to point
1.4,"Yadav to Archer, OUT","he's gloved this down leg, so the move hasn't worked. Archer swivels back to pull but is cramped for room as the ball angles back in, faint little edge through to Parthiv. Fourth duck of the season for Jofra."
1.3,"Yadav to Archer, no run",stands tall and punches this length ball to point
1.2,"Yadav to Archer, no run","skiddy bouncer, Archer is late on the pull, toe-ends it to midwicket"
1.1,"Yadav to Archer, no run","length ball on middle, Archer works this to midwicket"
0.6,"Chahal to Tripathi, no run","drifts back in from wide of the crease, lands on length and spins back in. Tripathi defends. Excellent first over"
0.5,"Chahal to Tripathi, no run","slows it down nicely, tossed up on middle, Tripathi lunges forward and blocks"

19.6,"Boult to Jadeja, 1 run","142 kph, full and straight, skewed away to long-on. And Daredevils take away a 34-run win."
19.5,"Boult to Chahar, 1 run","a slower ball on off, inside-edged to square leg"
19.4,"Boult to Chahar, no run","full down leg, Chahar walks right across and misses a swing. Good non-call, not a wide."
19.3,"Boult to Jadeja, 1 run","short and wide, under-edged to the keeper for a run."
19.2,"Boult to Bravo, OUT","a full delivery outside off, Bravo backs away and chips a lofted drive towards cover. Shankar backtracks and takes it comfortably."
19.1,"Boult to Jadeja, 1 run","a low full toss down leg, worked to deep square leg for a run."
18.6,"Patel to Jadeja, 1 leg bye","length on middle and leg, 134 kph, off the pad to third man. Sensational night for Harshal Patel: 4-0-23-1 and a terrific cameo."
18.5,"Patel to Jadeja, no run","a shortish and wide delivery outside off. And again, Jadeja plays over the line, another dot."
18.4,"Patel to Bravo, 1 run","a shortish delivery outside off, swings too early again, to deep square leg."
18.3,"Patel to Jadeja, 1 run","a short and wide delivery outside off, cut to deep point for a run. That's the better option in these conditions, can't concede sixes to that."
18.2,"Patel to Jadeja, 2 runs","a short slower ball down leg, worked to short fine leg, who falls over the ball, concedes an additional run."
18.1,"Patel to Jadeja, SIX runs","just clears the boundary. Full on middle and off, Jadeja lofts the ball elegantly. Very high but just enough and clears the straight boundary."
17.6,"Boult to Dhoni, OUT","that's the game! A stunning over this from Boult. Not just because he has conceded just five and taken out MS Dhoni, but his execution has been awesome. A low full toss from Boult, on middle and off. Dhoni broings out his bottom hand and whips the ball flat. But not enough distance. Iyer runs in and takes a good catch."
17.5,"Boult to Jadeja, 1 run","a full delivery on middle and leg, swung away to deep square leg for a run."
17.4,"Boult to Dhoni, 3 runs","and now the short ball, around middle and leg. Pulled away to midwicket. Boult goes for the catch but falls over. Long-on throws wildly to the keeper and somehow Mishra gets around to his left to prevent four overthrows. CSK get three"
17.3,"Boult to Dhoni, no run",awesome bowling. He has a clear plan (the easy part) and then he executes to Dhoni with deadly accuracy (soooo hard).
17.2,"Boult to Dhoni, no run","it's wide, but on a length. Dhoni's eyes light up and he swings, but toe-ends it back to the keeper. DOT."
17.1,"Boult to Jadeja, 1 run","creamed that, but he finds deep midwicket. Back of a length on off, pulled away with fierce power."
16.6,"Patel to Jadeja, 1 run","Avesh does not go for the catch. The bowler says go for it. Full and wide outside off, Jadeja looks to go over cover but the ball skews off the outside half, to the sweeper cover fielder. On the bounce!"
16.5,"Patel to Dhoni, 1 run","and again. Another short and wide slower ball, chopped away down to gully for one."
16.4,"Patel to Dhoni, no run","short on middle and leg, pulled away down to short fine leg. Another dot."
16.3,"Patel to Dhoni, no run","another dot! A short slower ball outside off, Dhoni misses an attempted dab to third man."
16.2,"Patel to Jadeja, 1 run","a good length delivery on off and middle, worked to deep square leg for a run."
16.1,"Patel to Jadeja, no run","well bowled, the right length. Quick outside off, not full, not short. Jadeja misses a cut."
15.6,"Lamichhane to Dhoni, no run","the legbreak outside off, pushed to cover. Excellent spell from the young leggie: 4-0-21-1."
15.5,"Lamichhane to Jadeja, 1 run","short around off, pulled to deep midwicket"
15.4,"Lamichhane to Dhoni, 1 run","flat on off, worked to long-on. Dhoni knows what he's doing. Letting Jadeja take the risks now, he'll stay there till over No. 20 and take full responsibility then"
15.3,"Lamichhane to Jadeja, 1 run","flat and straight, driven to long-on for a run."
15.2,"Lamichhane to Jadeja, 2 runs","that's sloppy. Short and wide outside off, carved away to deep cover for a couple. A misfield from Harshal allows two."
15.1,"Lamichhane to Jadeja, SIX runs","gets to the pitch and Jadeja goes boom! A googly outside off, Jadeja runs down, gets there and launches a massive six over the bowler's head. 89 metres back."
14.6,"Mishra to Dhoni, no run","another dart, quick down leg. Dhoni misses a sweep. Struck on the pad."
14.5,"Mishra to Dhoni, no run","quick and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
14.4,"Mishra to Jadeja, 1 run","tossed up outside off, worked to long-on with the spin."
14.3,"Mishra to Billings, OUT","top-edged sweep, down to short fine leg. It's always risky sweeping a wristspinner for this very reason. The googly ALWAYS produces extra bounce because there are more revolutions on the ball. So you'd rather go from bottom to top while sweeping. But Billings tries to keep this down, takes a thick leading edge straight to the fielder. Also, he had to drag the shot from well outside off."
14.2,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 run","a very quick delivery on off, maybe the low full toss, smashed to long-on"
14.1,"Mishra to Dhoni, no run","spin for Mishy. Flat on off and middle, the ball spins and beats the bat."
13.6,"Lamichhane to Billings, no run","just short of cover! That's the shot I was referring to, dancing down and trying to work the ball to midwicket. But the ball spins away, takes the leading edge and lobs towards cover."
13.5,"Lamichhane to Billings, no run","shortish and wide, the googly. Cut to point"
13.4,"Lamichhane to Billings, no run","just misses leg stump! The googly down leg, Billings looks for the reverse-swat (he plays that as well very well). But bottom-edged and just misses leg stump"
13.3,"Lamichhane to Dhoni, 1 run","runs down the pitch, meets the ball as it pitches and skews a lofted drive to long-on"
13.2,"Lamichhane to Billings, 1 run","too full, on-driven to long-on"
13.1,"Lamichhane to Raina, OUT","he's picked out deep midwicket. And Lamichhane is pumped! That was a googly that Raina picked as soon as it was released because of the line - it was down leg. So Raina cleared his front leg and looked to smash that over midwicket, but he did not get underneath it well enough. All he did was pick out the fielder."
12.6,"Mishra to Dhoni, no run",a very full delivery and Dhoni just pushes it back.
12.5,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","the googly outside off, Raina closes the bat face and gets a leading edge towards extra cover for a run"
12.4,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 run","a legbreak outside off, tapped to point for a run. And Dhoni has 6000 T20 runs"
12.3,"Mishra to Dhoni, no run","quick and flat outside off, punched to cover from the crease"
12.2,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","95 kph, flat and quick on middle and leg, pulled to deep midwicket"
12.1,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 run","the flat delivery outside off, pulled to deep midwicket for a single."
11.6,"Maxwell to Raina, no run","flat and wide outside off, carved to point."
11.5,"Maxwell to Raina, no run","flat outside off, pushed to cover. 95 kph."
11.4,"Maxwell to Dhoni, 1 run","an offbreak on leg, worked to deep midwicket for a run"
11.3,"Maxwell to Dhoni, FOUR runs","short and wide from Maxwell, and even though the ball is turning back in, Dhoni creates room by generating some power through the line of the ball and scything the ball through backward point."
11.2,"Maxwell to Raina, 1 run","flat outside off, punched to long-off from the back foot"
11.1,"Maxwell to Raina, FOUR runs","that's the Raina trademark. A flat delivery outside off from Maxwell, Raina lofts the ball over cover so easily. I remember him playing a similar shot in the second IPL, with Matthew Hayden at the non-striker's end. Now, Hayden on air says ""there is no better player of that shot"""
10.6,"Lamichhane to Raina, 1 run","another googly, on middle and leg. You can read that based on where it pitched. Nudged to square leg."
10.5,"Lamichhane to Dhoni, 1 run","lots of flight outside off, driven with the spin to long-off"
10.4,"Lamichhane to Raina, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, chopped to extra cover for a tight run"
10.3,"Lamichhane to Dhoni, 1 run","comes down and chips the ball towards long-on, in typical Dhoni fashion"
10.2,"Lamichhane to Raina, 1 run","naughty. A googly outside off, punched away to the bowler's left. He dives over the ball in his follow-through"
10.1,"Lamichhane to Dhoni, 1 run","a full delivery outside off, drilled to deep cover for a run"
9.6,"Patel to Rayudu, OUT","good catch by Maxwell! He's hit that well, but he's met the ball too early. Rayudu came charging at the bowler but it was an offcutter. So Rayudu was through the shot a fraction of a second earlier than he would have liked. Therefore, the ball met the bat with its bat face already pointing up. That means the ball will always go higher up than further back. Hangs in the air for a long time. Maxwell takes a good reverse-cupped catch."
9.5,"Patel to Raina, 1 run","a short delivery down leg, helped down to fine leg for one. Another slower ball, 112 kph."
9.4,"Patel to Rayudu, 1 run","full and straight, pushed to long-on. Another fifty for Rayudu, off 28 balls. Sparkling form."
9.3,"Patel to Raina, 1 run","a slower ball down leg, worked to deep midwicket. Taking pace off the ball is a good option here."
9.2,"Patel to Rayudu, 1 run","better line, more on middle and leg, worked to deep square leg for one."
9.1,"Patel to Rayudu, FOUR runs",an excellent yorker but the line is errant. It's slightly leg side-ish and Rayudu flicks the ball easily through backward square leg for four. Just had to place the ball there.
8.6,"Mishra to Rayudu, 1 run","full on off, and it's flatter this time. Driven to mid off, and they're taking the quick run. Rayudu would've been gone, except the fielder can't get the direct hit."
8.5,"Mishra to Rayudu, SIX runs","flighted on middle, but Rayudu comes down the wicket, converts it into a full toss, and then thumps it over Mishra's head. Oh, delighful."
8.4,"Mishra to Rayudu, FOUR runs","full just outside off, and it's the one that's spinning away. Rayudu's quick to pick that, and drives it beautifully after getting to the pitch of the ball. Long off can't cut it off either"
8.3,"Mishra to Rayudu, no run","full on off, and defended back to the bowler off the front foot"
8.2,"Mishra to Rayudu, no run","full on leg, and Rayudu comes dancing down the wicket. Misses the drive, and it hits his front leg. Impact outside leg"
8.1,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","bowls the cross seamer, almost like a pacer! Full on middle, and Raina pushes it towards midwicket and gets off strike"
7.6,"Maxwell to Raina, 1 run","full on off, and Raina takes a big stride forward to drive to wide long on. He'll keep strike"
7.5,"Maxwell to Raina, no run",fended by Raina on this occasion
7.4,"Maxwell to Rayudu, 1 run","full on middle, and worked off his toes to wide long on"
7.3,"Maxwell to Raina, 1 run","full on off, and smothered with the spin to midwicket"
7.2,"Maxwell to Raina, no run","full on off stump, from around the wicket. Defended off the front foot by Raina."
7.1,"Maxwell to Rayudu, 1 run","good length outside off, and punched off the back foot past the non-striker to long on"
6.6,"Mishra to Raina, no run","dropped first ball! Pant the guilty man. Good length outside off, and sliding further away from Raina. He tried to poke at it, but the ball found the outside edge. Oh dear"
6.5,"Mishra to Watson, OUT","flighted on off, and turning away from Watson. He tries to lift it over Mishra, and this time it doesn't have the power to go over long off. Straight down Boult's throat in the deep"
6.4,"Mishra to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and he stands tall to punch it past the bowler's left. Mid off's there"
6.3,"Mishra to Rayudu, no run","flighted on middle, and Rayudu drives it straight back to Mishra. Meets the ball before it could even turn"
6.2,"Mishra to Watson, 1 run","full on middle, and Watson drives it to the cover region"
6.1,"Mishra to Watson, no run","full on middle, and he tries to slog it towards the leg side. The legspin takes the leading edge, and it goes to cover"
5.6,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, SIX runs","Twenty-two runs off the over! What a way to end the Powerplay. Length ball on off, and Rayudu backs away to power it over wide long on this time. Swings away, and connects with it well enough for it to soar over the boundary rope. Big, big over. End of the Powerplay too, and they've taken the time-out as well"
5.5,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, SIX runs","good length on middle, but Rayudu comes shimmying down the wicket. Swings his bat towards the leg side, and manages to get some connection behind it. Mistimed, but enough power for it to over the midwicket boundary"
5.4,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, no run","good length on off, and Rayudu backs away before driving it through the cover region. A packed field inside the circle though"
5.3,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, FOUR runs",four or six is the question! Drops just short of the boundary. Length ball on off and Rayudu swivels to slog it over the cow-corner region once again. Ten off three
5.2,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, no run","quick! Rayudu's too slow to play the pull. Short on off and angling into Rayudu. He tried to repeat that shot, but it's come off the bat's top half and over the bowler's head"
5.1,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, SIX runs","full on off, and that's been thumped over cow corner! Once again Rayudu goes well to deep inside the crease, gets his front leg out of the way, and then powers it into the midwicket boundary"
4.6,"Patel to Watson, no run","full on middle but angling into his pads. Watson misses the shot towards midwicket, and it raps him on his pads. Appeal for lbw turned down. Good decision, the bowler's natural angle would've taken it down the leg side"
4.5,"Patel to Rayudu, 1 run","short on off, and Rayudu pirouettes on his toes to pull it to deep backward square"
4.4,"Patel to Rayudu, no run","short outside off, and that's a wild shot from Rayudu. Tries to slap it over point, but absolutely no timing behind that. Through his shot way too early"
4.3,"Patel to Watson, 1 run","slower ball, outside off, and Watson checks his slog. Muscles it over midwicket, and the ball falls in no man's land"
4.2,"Patel to Watson, no run","full on off, and driven down the ground past the non-striker to mid on. No chance of a single"
4.1,"Patel to Watson, no run","good length on off, and Watson rocks back to fend it off the back foot"
3.6,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, no run","back of a length, but very wide outside off. Rayudu did shuffle across to the off side, but failed to connect with the cut. Through to Pant"
3.5,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, FOUR runs","crunched through cover! Full, but just a bit too much outside the off side. Rayudu goes deep into his crease, and smashes it over extra cover. Great shot"
3.4,"Avesh Khan to Watson, 1 run","length ball on off, and angling into Watson. He drops his hands, and defends it towards the leg side. Rayudu wants the quick single, and he manages to complete it easily. Watson looked kinda surprised by the pace!"
3.3,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","full on off, and tries to slog towards the leg side. Slices it towards deep backward square though"
3.2,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, no run","full on middle again, and almost a yorker this time. Dug away towards mid on, but no single on offer"
3.1,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, no run","overpitched outside off, and Rayudu mistimes the straight drive. Plays it back to the bowler on this occasion"
2.6,"Boult to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length on leg stump, and Rayudu walks across to the off side. Whips it off his pads to square leg"
2.5,"Boult to Watson, 1 leg bye","on leg stump, but shaping down the leg side. Hits his pad though, and the ball drops near his toes. They scamper across for a run"
2.4,"Boult to Watson, no run","yorker on leg! Great comeback ball, but Watson manages to dig it away towards the leg side"
2.3,"Boult to Watson, SIX runs","pulled for a flat six! Good length on middle, and way too comfortable for the big man. Thumps it over deep midwicket, with an excellent swing of the bat"
2.2,"Boult to Rayudu, 1 run","good length on off, and gets big on Rayudu. He glances it down to third man to get off the mark"
2.1,"Boult to Rayudu, no run","good length on off, and angling away from the batsman. Rayudu, playing his first ball, tries to defend towards cover, but the ball goes past his outside edge. Nice carry to Pant"
1.6,"Lamichhane to Watson, no run","full outside off, and turning into Watto again. Defended off the front foot to mid on"
1.5,"Lamichhane to Watson, no run","full outside off, and it's the legspinner. But Watson played for the googly, and the drive takes a leading edge. Goes to mid off"
1.4,"Lamichhane to Watson, no run","full just outside off, and defended towards the off side"
1.3,"Lamichhane to Watson, no run","flighted outside off, and it's the wrong'un this time! Turns sharply into Watson, who backs away and cuts to point"
1.2,"Lamichhane to Watson, 2 runs","flighted outside off, and driven with the turn past cover. Iyer gives it a chase, and manages to pull it back. Abhishek Sharma cleans up"
1.1,"Lamichhane to Watson, no run","full on off, and going straight into Watson's pads. Defended back to the bowler off the back foot"
0.6,"Boult to Watson, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and get big on Watson. He tried to defend off the back foot, comes off the bat's shoulder. Goes to third man"
0.5,"Boult to Watson, 2 runs","short on middle, and Watson manages to swivel and pull. Mistimes the shot to deep midwicket, and CSK are off the mark"
0.4,"Boult to Watson, no run","full on middle, and this has been picked off his toes towards the leg side. Played to midwicket, but yet another dot"
0.3,"Boult to Watson, no run","full on middle, and shaping into his pads again. Driven to mid off on this occasion. Three dots to start off"
0.2,"Boult to Watson, no run","late inswing! But well defended by Watson. Full on middle, and angling back into his pads"
0.1,"Boult to Watson, no run","good length outside off, and punched off the back foot to cover point"
19.6,"Bravo to Patel, SIX runs",Bravo concedes 52 off four overs! That was the worst last over from Bravo I've seen ever. Ends with a full toss on off and Harshal smashes the ball straight back for six. Hits the sightscreen.
19.5,"Bravo to Patel, SIX runs","six more. A nice symmetry to this over: 6, 1, 6, 1, 6. In the slot again and Harshal drills a lofted drive over Bravo's head. Big hit again."
19.4,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 run","length down leg, worked to deep midwicket"
19.3,"Bravo to Shankar, SIX runs","another poor delivery. A length slower ball on middle and off, Shankar swats the delivery over midwicket. Picked the variation. Might want to change his line."
19.2,"Bravo to Patel, 1 run","much better. A yorker outside off, jammed to long-on for one"
19.1,"Bravo to Patel, SIX runs",that's a poor delivery. Right in the slot from DJ. A quick length delivery on middle and leg. A well-executed lofted heave over long-on. Full face of the bat.
18.6,"Thakur to Patel, 1 run","a length delivery on middle and leg, slogged away to deep square leg."
18.5,"Thakur to Patel, no run","excellent slower ball, the knuckle ball. On middle. A bit of extra bounce takes the ball over off and middle stump after beating a heave"
18.4,"Thakur to Shankar, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, mis-timed again to long-on for a run."
18.3,"Thakur to Patel, 1 run","full and wide outside off, 134 kph, Harshal looked for a lap scoop but tapped it to point"
18.2,"Thakur to Shankar, 1 run","a length delivery outside off, swatted to deep midwicket"
18.1,"Thakur to Shankar, 2 runs","just clears mid-off. A good length delivery outside off, Shankar chips a flat-batted swat over mid-off for a couple."
17.6,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 run","133 kph, a low full toss is worked away to deep midwicket for one."
17.5,"Bravo to Shankar, 2 runs","a shorter slower ball outside off, flicked away into the gap at midwicket for two. Right in the gap. Even Sam Billings can't stop two."
17.4,"Bravo to Patel, 1 run","a full toss on middle and leg, pulled away to deep midwicket. Very bad timing on that, under the waist."
17.3,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 run","full outside off, blocked to mid-off for a run. Nicely bowled from Bravo."
17.2,"Bravo to Patel, 1 run","full on middle and leg, punched to long-on"
17.1,"Bravo to Patel, SIX runs","that's a good slower ball, it deceived Harshal Patel. But he got there early and still flicked the ball over square leg for six. Enough power"
16.6,"Thakur to Shankar, no run",a wide yorker that is well executed. Jammed away into the leg side.
16.5,"Thakur to Shankar, SIX runs","digs it in, Shankar reads the length early, stays back and pulls over deep midwicket for a big six. Far too easy once he picked the length."
16.4,"Thakur to Patel, 1 run","full down leg, worked to deep midwicket for one."
16.3,"Thakur to Shankar, 1 run","a back of a length delivery outside off, Shankar mis-times a pull to long-on for one"

16.1,"Thakur to Shankar, no run","a full delivery outside off, an open-faced dab to backward point."
15.6,"Ngidi to Patel, FOUR runs","boundary to end the over! That never hurts. Offcutter outside off, and slapped away to the point boundary"
15.5,"Ngidi to Patel, no run","slower ball outside off, and Harshal waits for a long time before fending it back to the bowler"
15.4,"Ngidi to Shankar, 1 run","played to the man at deep square leg this time. On off, but angling into his pads. Billings in the deep"
15.3,"Ngidi to Shankar, no run","full toss outside off, and he plays the check-drive to cover. Well stopped!"
15.3,"Ngidi to Shankar, 1 wide","deja vu! Same line, same length, same result. Good length on middle, and going down leg"
15.3,"Ngidi to Shankar, 1 wide","good length on middle, but sliding down the leg side. A run added to Daredevils' total"
15.2,"Ngidi to Patel, 1 run","full on off, and worked away towards deep midwicket this time. They walk across for one"
15.1,"Ngidi to Patel, no run","yorker, outside off. And Patel squeezes it away towards point. Off the bat's toe end"
14.6,"Thakur to Shankar, FOUR runs","lovely! Short on middle, and Shankar adjusts towards the off side, and flicks it fine past MSD's left. Collects four to end the over"
14.5,"Thakur to Patel, 1 run","full on off, and whips it off his pads to deep midwicket. Gets off the mark first ball"
14.4,"Thakur to Abhishek, OUT","short on middle, and that's been top edged! Bhajji makes no mistake at mid on. Quicker ball, and his inexperience to the pace shows. Not as good a performance as last time for Abhishek. The ball got big on him, and eventually cramped him for space. Looks like it's the time-out as well"
14.3,"Thakur to Abhishek, no run","punched! But well stopped by Raina at cover. Stood tall, and played it well, but you know how good Raina is"
14.2,"Thakur to Shankar, 1 run","plays it late, and chops it down to third man. Good length just outside off on this occasion"
14.1,"Thakur to Abhishek, 1 run","on off, and pushed off the back foot towards cover. Comes off the bat's outside half, and goes to deep backward point instead"
13.6,"Jadeja to Abhishek, 1 run",plays it to midwicket to get off the mark. Nice use of the wrists to give it a whip
13.5,"Jadeja to Maxwell, OUT","but he's gone this time! What a terrible way to get out. Full on leg, and he tried to play the reverse sweep. The quicker ball sneaks under his bat, and crashes into the leg stump. Pays the price for playing a pre-meditated shot"
13.4,"Jadeja to Maxwell, no run","full on off, and turns away from the batsman. He defends down the wrong line, and MSD whips the bails off. Stumped? Naw, his back leg was always down"
13.3,"Jadeja to Shankar, 1 run","flat on middle again, and Shankar goes onto the back foot. Fended towards short cover"
13.2,"Jadeja to Shankar, no run","flatter on middle, and clipped off his pads to square leg. Two dots"
13.1,"Jadeja to Shankar, no run",full on off and driven to wide mid off
12.6,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 run","low full toss, and Shankar plays this towards wide long on. It was an attempted slower ball"
12.5,"Bravo to Shankar, FOUR runs","full just outside off, and that's been drilled! Straight past Bravo, and even beats the man at long off! Bravo did well to get his feet out of the way"
12.4,"Bravo to Maxwell, 1 run","slower ball, and Maxwell mistimes to long on. It was full and wide outside off, and his attempted punch comes off the bat's inside half"
12.3,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 run","full on off, and the straight drive goes to deep midwicket. That's because the bat turned in his hand"
12.2,"Bravo to Shankar, no run","short on off, and he tries to hook it over square leg. Misses, and the ball goes through to MSD. Shankar looks at the umpire for a wide, but nope."
12.1,"Bravo to Maxwell, 1 run","full on off, and pushed past the non-striker to long on. They walk across for another run"
12.1,"Bravo to Maxwell, 1 wide","extras. Yorker, but outside leg. MSD does well to hang on to it"
11.6,"Jadeja to Shankar, no run","good length on off, and fended towards the off side"
11.5,"Jadeja to Shankar, no run","back of a length on off, and spinning away from Shankar. Tries to defend, but the ball sneaks just past his outside edge"
11.4,"Jadeja to Shankar, no run","full just outside off, and defended with the bat's open face to point"
11.3,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run","on leg stump, and clipped off his pads to midwicket. No one's there, so Jaddu has to go chasing behind it"
11.2,"Jadeja to Shankar, 1 run","gets off the mark first ball. Full on off, and pushed to wide long off with ease"
11.1,"Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run","full on middle and leg, and worked off his pads to deep midwicket. A walking single"
10.6,"Ngidi to Pant, OUT","full outside off, and Pant tries the big heave towards midwicket. Slices it though, and that's gone straight down third man's throat. Lungi gets Pant"
10.5,"Ngidi to Pant, 2 runs","slower ball, and a length delivery on leg stump. Pant shuffles across to the off side, and nudges it off his hips to deep midwicket"

10.3,"Ngidi to Iyer, OUT","cleaned him up! Iyer tries to make room and cut, but Ngidi bowls straight on off stump. Iyer misses, Ngidi hits. Crashes into the top of off stump"
10.2,"Ngidi to Iyer, no run","too close to his body for the cut! On the corridor of uncertainty, but Iyer attempted the square cut anyway. Through to Dhoni"
10.1,"Ngidi to Pant, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and that's been pulled along the carpet. Man in the deep"
9.6,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run",he'll keep strike. Good length outside off and he walks down the wicket to tap it towards cover
9.5,"Harbhajan to Pant, SIX runs","flighted outside off, and Pant takes the bait! Slices it over Bhajji's head, and long off's getting under. Nope! Sails just over Bravo"
9.4,"Harbhajan to Pant, no run","grip and spin! On off, but turning away from Pant. Defended with soft hands"
9.3,"Harbhajan to Pant, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and cut away past point! Men there inside the circle, but Pant manages to thread the gap with perfection"
9.2,"Harbhajan to Pant, no run","tries the reverse, but can't connect! It was full outside off, but Pant expected it to be closer to him. Stopped by MSD"
9.1,"Harbhajan to Pant, SIX runs","on his toes, and slogged over cow corner! Full on off, and muscled by Pant towards the leg side. The ball straightened after pitching, but Pant's just too good"
8.6,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","full outside off, slogged away to long-on for one."
8.5,"Bravo to Iyer, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, driven to long-on for a run."
8.4,"Bravo to Pant, 1 leg bye","a slower ball down leg, Pant misses a flick. Off the pad to square leg."
8.3,"Bravo to Pant, no run","a length delivery down leg, Pant swings across the line, off the thigh pad down to fine leg."
8.2,"Bravo to Pant, 2 runs","just over cover. Full outside off, chipped over cover for two. A sloppy effort from Thakur and Pant gets two"
8.1,"Bravo to Pant, no run","full outside off, Pant looks to drive but the ball goes past the outside edge, Just missed a straight ball."
8.1,"Bravo to Pant, 1 wide","angles this wide, but too wide. Called a wide."
7.6,"Harbhajan to Iyer, no run","a wide yorker outside off, jammed out. I wonder why spinners don't bowl that more, it's a very good defensive option, right?"
7.5,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run","and now a good single. Slow outside off, tapped to point for one"
7.4,"Harbhajan to Pant, FOUR runs","that's muscled. Feigns a forward movement then goes back, forcing a short delivery from Bhajj. Rocks back and carves his cut in front of cover. Lovely batting and execution"
7.3,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run","short and wide, 91 kph, carved away to deep point."
7.2,"Harbhajan to Iyer, no run",nicely bowled. Sees Iyer coming so he fires it wider. Defended to cover.
7.1,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run",runs down and shovels a flick to long-on.
6.6,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","quick down leg, the pace beats Iyer's flick. Struck on the pad."
6.5,"Jadeja to Iyer, FOUR runs","beautifully played. That's all class. Short and wide outside off, sliced away off the open face through backward point for four."
6.4,"Jadeja to Pant, 1 run","gets his body behind the ball, like my cricket coach used to say. Short and wide outside off, carved towards short third man. Harbhajan dives over the ball but his broad frame stops the ball."
6.3,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","on middle and leg, nudged away to deep midwicket again. One more run."
6.2,"Jadeja to Pant, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, wanted to slog sweep but had to improvise a dab to point."
6.1,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","on the pads from Jadeja, 96 kph, worked to midwicket for one."
5.6,"Thakur to Pant, no run","130 kph, another bouncer on off. Pant gets over the bounce and pulls, but finds midwicket."
5.5,"Thakur to Pant, FOUR runs","122 kph, a short delivery, aimed at the helmet. Pant watches this nicely, gets on top of the bounce and pulls through square leg for four. Nice."
5.4,"Thakur to Pant, no run","and again! Wow, there is no improvisation or reassessment from Daredevils. Back of a length outside off, a swing and the ball goes over the bat."
5.3,"Thakur to Pant, no run","full and wide outside off, another swing and miss from Pant."
5.2,"Thakur to Pant, no run","full outside off, a leaden-footed drilled drive finds mid-off."
5.1,"Thakur to Pant, 2 runs","full and straight, some swing. Pant works the ball through backward square leg for a couple. He had to get bat on it because it swung back in."
4.6,"Chahar to Iyer, FOUR runs",awful bowling. Tripe. He digs a slower bouncer outside off with third man up? Iyer has four free runs if he makes contact: he does with an upper cut over Dhoni.
4.5,"Chahar to Iyer, no run","a slower ball down leg, Iyer stands his ground and slogs across the line. Misses. Struck on the pad, but going down leg."
4.4,"Chahar to Iyer, FOUR runs","clever batting! Makes room, clears his front leg, gets a ball to cut because it's short and wide. He goes from bottom to top and slices the ball over the infield, over point."
4.3,"Chahar to Iyer, no run","out with a direct hit! Good from Pant to trust his partner. But maybe he shouldn't have. A good length delivery down leg, Iyer pushes to mid-on, calls for one, realises his weight is on the back foot so he says no very late. But Pant is already down, he turns back and dives back. But the throw from the fielder is not accurate so he's fine. His wrist is not though. Some damage to his hand."
4.2,"Chahar to Pant, 1 run","good length delivery on off, pushed to cover for one. That's much better cricket, if the ball is not there for the shot, you take one."
4.1,"Chahar to Shaw, OUT","and it gets worse. What kind of a shot is that? It's a good length delivery on off, Shaw stands in his crease and looks to hoick the ball over midwicket. No feet movement, no regard for the fielder at long-on. Exuberance, I suppose. But all he can do is splice the ball to long-on. That was not a very pleasing innings."
3.6,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","flat and wide, Iyer tries an open-faced dab but misses."
3.5,"Jadeja to Shaw, 1 run","dropped. Should have been taken. Quick and straight, it's another ugly across-the-line hoick that travels at head height to Thakur's right. He sticks out his right hand but the ball pops out."
3.4,"Jadeja to Shaw, 2 runs","good work. Flat and straight, Shaw slog-sweeps again over midwicket. Just clears the fielder. Thakur goes back and pulls the ball back in."
3.3,"Jadeja to Shaw, no run","quick, flat and straight, defended"
3.2,"Jadeja to Shaw, 2 runs","just over midwicket for a couple. Flat and straight, Shaw stays low and slogs a sweep over midwicket. He's looking quite bad with those strokes"
3.1,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","full on off, quick. Iyer comes down and pushes away to long-off. More of a leading edge"
2.6,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length outside off, Iyer makes room and slices a cut to backward point. Picks out the fielder very well. But a fumble allows one."
2.5,"Chahar to Iyer, no run","good length and straight, defended back towards mid-on"
2.4,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 run","a full delivery on off, it's a wild slog over midwicket. Across the line. A thick outside edge races down to third man. I'm just wondering should such a young batsman be playing these shots so early in his career?"
2.3,"Chahar to Shaw, SIX runs","he's picked the length of that. A slower delivery on middle and leg, Shaw reads the length and swats over midwicket with so much ease. A poor delivery."
2.2,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","full delivery outside off, a massive swing and miss from Shaw."
2.2,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 wide","a good change in length but too short. Dug in around middle, Shaw ducks. Too high."
2.1,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","swung away. Looking to go through the line. Full and wide outside off, Shaw throws his hands at the ball, mis-hit to mid-off"
1.6,"Ngidi to Iyer, no run","good length around off, Iyer defends towards point solidly"
1.5,"Ngidi to Iyer, no run","good length delivery outside off, tapped away towards backward point"
1.4,"Ngidi to Shaw, 1 run","that's better timing. Good length outside off, punched to wide mid-off. The fielder dives to his left and saves runs, Bhajji the fielder."
1.3,"Ngidi to Shaw, no run","wow, Shaw struggling against swing! Full this time outside off, Shaw drives and is beaten comfortably. Very loose indeed"
1.2,"Ngidi to Iyer, 1 run","nice work. Good length outside off, outside-halved down to third man for a run. Thakur runs to his right and saves three."
1.1,"Ngidi to Iyer, 2 leg byes","was there glove on that? Sloppy glovework from Dhoni. Back of a length down leg, off the pad as Iyer misses a flick. Dhoni dives to his left, but the ball pops out for some leg byes."
0.6,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","beaten again! Good length delivery outside off, Shaw's feet are rooted in the crease as he drives. The ball beats the bat"
0.5,"Chahar to Shaw, FOUR runs","hoicked away over square leg. Chahar tries the other one this time, the inswinger. Back of a length down leg, Shaw picks the length early and pulls easily over square leg"
0.4,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","back of a length on middle and leg, punched away to mid-on from the back foot."
0.3,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","beaten on swing again! That's another beautiful delivery, back of a length outside off. Shaw looks to punch the ball through cover, but the ball swings and moves away late"
0.2,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","back of a length outside off, Shaw stands tall and punches to cover from the back foot"
0.1,"Chahar to Shaw, no run",beauty! Swing! A good length delivery pitched on off or just outside off. The ball pitches and swerves away from the prod late. Jaffa
0.1,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 wide",yikes. That's a horror start. Short and very far down leg. Wide.
19.6,"Siraj to Pandey, 1 run","swings this full toss towards wide long-on, single is all Pandey will get.  Firecrackers go off in Bengaluru as RCB stay alive!  Sunrisers have been pipped at the post despite some shoddy bowling from Royal Challengers."
19.5,"Siraj to Pandey, 2 runs","slices this up and over the infield, lands in no man's land behind point, they'll come back for the second. Chinnaswamy roars, the red flags are out"
19.4,"Siraj to Hooda, 1 run"," Kohli fluffs a simple chance at long-off  but Chinnaswamy applauds because they know barring a brain freeze, they can't lose this. Hooda looked to clear the ropes, toe-ended it"
19.3,"Siraj to Pandey, 1 leg bye","full toss angling down, swings and misses. Ball deflects off the pad towards short fine. A leg bye is all they'll get.  Siraj escapes with a juicy full toss "
19.2,"Siraj to Pandey, no run","trying to be too cute, misses. Looks to ramp this over short third man but the length is too full and straight. Can't lay bat to it"
19.1,"Siraj to Williamson, OUT"," scoops this straight to de Grandhomme at fine leg!  This went a mile in the air as he walked out to expose all three stumps and scoop, the ball went a mile, was swirling high and handsome, but de Grandhomme kept his composure to pull off a difficult catch. Is that the game? What a game."
18.6,"Southee to Pandey, FOUR runs","misses his length, and gets pumped! Right underneath the length as he belts this to beat wide long-off."
18.5,"Southee to Pandey, no run","in the blockhole, just inside the wide line. Pandey let it go, errs in judgment. Hits the turf in anger."
18.4,"Southee to Williamson, 1 run","walks across to scoop, Southee bowls this full and wide, deflected gently to short third man, misfield from substitute Pawan Negi, but there's no damage done"
18.3,"Southee to Pandey, 1 run","into the blockhole perfectly, squeezed on the bounce over Southee's head, Kohli comes hustling in from long-off to keep it to a single"
18.2,"Southee to Pandey, FOUR runs","one bounce over long-off. Lined himself up, stayed right inside the crease, got underneath the length and clobbered this"
18.1,"Southee to Pandey, FOUR runs","gets underneath the length and belts this over, de Grandhomme comes in from long-on, and slides to stop but in doing so, ends up kicking this over the ropes. Oh, oh. Half-century for Pandey. CDG was late in getting down"
18.1,"Southee to Pandey, 1 wide","slower ball gone wrong, way outside off."
17.6,"Siraj to Pandey, 1 run","right into the blockhole again, squeezes this to third man. Superb end to an over that started off badly"
17.5,"Siraj to Pandey, no run",beaten! Once again tried to play that scoop over short third man. Beaten by the change in pace. Bowled that cross-seam
17.5,"Siraj to Pandey, 1 wide","sees Pandey move around in the crease and spears this full and wide, but bowls this well outside the wide line outside off."
17.4,"Siraj to Williamson, 1 leg bye","walks across to scoop, gets into a tangle as the ball hits the pad. They scamper a leg bye"
17.3,"Siraj to Pandey, 1 run",swings this low full toss to deep midwicket
17.2,"Siraj to Pandey, FOUR runs","gets into position to scoop again, Siraj bowls length outside off, so Pandey gets down on one knee and ramps him cleverly over short third man. Stunning!"
17.1,"Siraj to Pandey, SIX runs",walks across the stumps and scoops this full delivery over short fine leg. All three stumps exposed. Siraj missed his yorker and watched him lap sweep. Pandey power. Finds an admirer in VVS from the dugout
16.6,"Southee to Pandey, 1 run","nails another wide yorker to perfection, squeezed to cover. Just six from it, magnificent over under pressure"
16.5,"Southee to Williamson, 1 run","walks across and squeezes this wide yorker to Umesh again, at mid-off. Followed Williamson's movements there."
16.4,"Southee to Pandey, 1 run","once again hit hard and flat, this time Umesh gets his body behind the line at mid-off."
16.3,"Southee to Pandey, 2 runs","drills this straight to mid-off, there's a misfield from Umesh to concede two when it should've been a dot. The Sydney harbour bridge"
16.2,"Southee to Pandey, no run","slower and fuller outside off, Pandey looks to go over Southee's head but mistimes it straight back to him. Dot ball"
16.1,"Southee to Williamson, 1 run","yorker-length outside off, Williamson walks across and squeezes this to third man"
15.6,"Chahal to Pandey, 2 runs","works this indrifter towards wide long-on, 100 partnership comes up"
15.5,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run",nurdled towards deep square as they jog the single
15.4,"Chahal to Pandey, 1 run","tossed up outside off, drilled to sweeper cover"
15.4,"Chahal to Pandey, 1 wide","short and fired down leg, wide called. Rightly so. Frustration for Chahal and RCB"
15.3,"Chahal to Pandey, 2 runs","turns this against the turn to deep square leg, the throw from de Grandhomme is on the bounce but a touch wide, Pandey hares back and is safe. Only just. Saved by a couple of centimetres. Great work by Parthiv as he gathered the throw and came up with an underarm flick onto the stumps"
15.2,"Chahal to Pandey, FOUR runs","short and sliding in, Pandey swivels back and helps this to the deep square leg boundary. Poor ball from Chahal"
15.1,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run",turns this shortish delivery to deep square
14.6,"Grandhomme to Pandey, SIX runs","clean strike to clear long-on. Big, big strike. Pandey is finding his hitting range, finally. Length ball from De Grandhomme, punished."
14.5,"Grandhomme to Williamson, 1 run",walks across and drives this full toss to the edge of the ring at cover
14.4,"Grandhomme to Williamson, SIX runs","full toss angling in and he's deposited this over deep square leg. This is magnificent, didn't try to over-hit. All timing and class. Magical wrist work to flick this"
14.3,"Grandhomme to Pandey, 1 run",slaps this to the edge of the ring at cover for a single
14.2,"Grandhomme to Pandey, FOUR runs","wrist work to the fore! Length and sliding into middle and leg, whipped to the square leg boundary"
14.1,"Grandhomme to Pandey, FOUR runs","pulled, this was destined to reach the boundary, but Kohli put out a sliding stop, or nearly. Slipped in trying to pull it back in and ended up parrying it over the boundary"
13.6,"Yadav to Williamson, SIX runs","this is deep into the stands at deep midwicket. Fetched the pull from outside off, hit it off the middle. SRH aren't out of this by any means. Umesh has bowled out"
13.5,"Yadav to Pandey, 1 run",whipped uppishly but down to AB on the bounce at deep midwicket
13.4,"Yadav to Williamson, 1 run",dabs this down to square third man
13.3,"Yadav to Williamson, FOUR runs","cut away, beats point like a tracer bullet as Shastri would say. Square third man stood no chance, magnificent timing."
13.2,"Yadav to Pandey, 1 run",defends this back down the ground to long-on. Was winding up to pull but the length wasn't there
13.1,"Yadav to Pandey, no run",cracked away but Moeen dives to his left to stop this wallop at cover
12.6,"Grandhomme to Williamson, SIX runs","muscled over deep midwicket. May have challenged the sweeper in Hyderabad, not so in Bangalore. This was headed into the stands right from the moment he hit it."

12.4,"Grandhomme to Williamson, 1 run","slower length ball again, slapped to deep cover"

11.3,"Siraj to Williamson, SIX runs","pulled over deep midwicket! Flat hit. Too short, sitting up nicely, Williamson picked the length early"
11.2,"Siraj to Williamson, no run","gets on top of the bounce and slaps this to a diving Mandeep at backward point, superb stop."
11.1,"Siraj to Williamson, no run","skiddy length ball on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"

10.3,"Chahal to Williamson, no run","drifts in a full ball from wide of the crease, defended back"

9.4,"Ali to Williamson, 1 run","touch shorter and spinning back in, whipped to deep midwicket"
9.3,"Ali to Williamson, SIX runs","goes over the ropes, clears deep midwicket. Clean loft, done with such class and composure. Got outside the line and then swung this with the spin. Delightful"
9.2,"Ali to Williamson, FOUR runs","whipped from outside off, bisects deep midwicket and wide long-on. Magnificent"
9.1,"Ali to Williamson, FOUR runs","hammers the pull to the square leg boundary. Too short from Moeen, he swivelled back and gave it a thump"

8.5,"Southee to Williamson, FOUR runs","steps out, reaches out to this length ball and lofts this over cover. Clean strike"
8.4,"Southee to Williamson, FOUR runs"," Sarfaraz has made a right royal mess at deep square leg!  Pulled straight to him, but he couldn't stop this as he bent low. Kicks the ropes in frustration"

8.2,"Southee to Pandey, no run",slapped to Mandeep on the bounce to point
8.1,"Southee to Pandey, no run",forces this length ball to cover
7.6,"Ali to Hales, OUT"," today is a day of catches, physics-defying from AB!  It's that superman AB de Villiers. The catch is so good that Kohli and his mates do a 100 metre dash to run towards their mate. Magnificent, incredible. Hales steps out and muscles this length ball over deep midwicket, he thinks he's cleared it but doesn't know what's to come. AB leaps high, but realises the ball was swirling away. Instinctively puts his right hand out and pulls off a one-handed stunner even as it continued to curl away. Mind you. he was airborne when the ball lodged in his hand, so there was still a simple matter of having to land, keep control and be mindful of the ropes. All items checked. Wow"
7.5,"Ali to Williamson, 1 run","steps out and works this with the spin to deep square, Umesh is a busy man"
7.4,"Ali to Hales, 1 run","sweeps but no timing, off a thick inside edge to deep square leg"

6.3,"Yadav to Williamson, 1 run",whips this from outside off towards Southee at deep midwicket

6.1,"Yadav to Williamson, no run",driven firmly but straight to mid-off

5.2,"Chahal to Williamson, no run",squeezes the drive to cover.
5.1,"Chahal to S Dhawan, OUT"," hit straight back!  Dhawan steps out to go over the top, can't get to the pitch and ends up chipping it back. Big wicket for RCB. Dhawan checked his shot because the ball gripped the surface and spun back in, may have been able to just clear the bowler had he gone through"
4.6,"Siraj to Hales, SIX runs","length ball sliding into middle and leg, swung over deep square with an air of nonchalance"
4.5,"Siraj to Hales, no run"," magnificent effort, but can't hold on at mid-on. Oh, Kohli has dropped a tough chance!  Drilled down the ground, Kohli took two steps to his left and then stretched to go with his left hand. Bobbled out as his elbow hit the turf"
4.4,"Siraj to S Dhawan, 1 run","through with the pull early, hit on the body. Siraj changed the pace, rolled his fingers across the seam to bowl a slower bouncer"

2.5,"Yadav to Hales, 1 run","Southee pulls off a stunner at deep square leg! This was pulled flat, but the ball was dying on Southee. He could've so easily looked to save the boundary, but he dived low and pulled it off inches from the ground.  Soft signal is out.  Understandable this time that the third umpire wants to look at multiple replays.  Oh, wait. Has he pressed the wrong button?  Not out flashes the big screen. Southee's face was in the firing line too, if he got a bad bounce, that could've so easily smashed into his face.  Oh, dear. Third umpire says not out.  He's overturned the decision. Kohli is shocked, Southee is shocked, shakes his head in disbelief.  Michael Clarke on air goes: ""I can't believe that!""  The third umpire in question is  C Shamsuddin "
2.4,"Yadav to Hales, no run","punched but can't beat mid-off, refuses the single."
2.3,"Yadav to Hales, no run","through with the pull even before the ball arrived, beaten."
2.2,"Yadav to Hales, SIX runs","the helicopter has taken off. The wristy whip from outside off to the deep midwicket boundary. Sensational from Hales. Not much wrong with the delivery, Umesh has an exasperated look."
2.1,"Yadav to Hales, FOUR runs","looks to go over mid-on but gets a thick inside edge that just about clears midwicket. Lucky boundary, but he'll take the runs"

19.4,"Kaul to Khan, 1 leg bye","a quick delivery on leg, Sarfraz is beaten for pace, off the thigh pad into the off side."
19.3,"Kaul to Khan, 2 runs","dropped by Sandeep! A slower ball on leg, Sarfraz top-edges his hoick, it carries to a very fine fine leg. Sandeep runs in but puts the catch down, he had too much forward momentum."
19.2,"Kaul to Grandhomme, OUT","Rashid takes that! He misjudged that as well but he's taken a one-handed stunner! Much like Trent Boult, Rashid misjudges this, comes in, and backtracks late. He then goes back, but this is much flatter so all he can do is stick out his right hand take the catch nonchalantly. It was a flat-batted swat from CdG."
19.1,"Kaul to Grandhomme, 2 runs","a wide slower delivery outside off, it goes up towards Williamson at cover. The ball swerves and swirls and Williamson drops it."
18.6,"Basil to Grandhomme, 1 run","a good yorker to finish. A low full toss on off, pushed to long-on. Thampi finishes with 4-0-70-0"
18.5,"Basil to Khan, 1 run","a slower delivery on off, Sarfraz tried to play the same shot but all he can do is tap the ball to backward point"
18.4,"Basil to Khan, SIX runs","140 kph, a straight full toss. Sarfraz shows AB how to play it. Opens the bat face and just lets the ball hit bat, over short third man for six. Lovely hit."
18.3,"Basil to Khan, FOUR runs","squeezed past backward point for four. That's more awful bowling. It's full and straight, right in the slot for a nice T20 heave away over midwicket, but Sarfraz opens the face and guides the ball past the fielder. Nicely done."
18.2,"Basil to Grandhomme, 1 run","gets away with that. Another poor ball, actually much worse than the previous delivery. It's a full toss on the pads, CdG picks out deep midwicket"
18.1,"Basil to Grandhomme, SIX runs","that's tripe from Thampi. 97 kph, a very very very very slow delivery outside off. CdG says I can play that, slapped over cover for six. Huuge."
17.6,"Kaul to Grandhomme, 1 run","good stop from Goswami. Another slower ball outside off, tapped away towards the keeper, who dives to his right and stops three."
17.5,"Kaul to Khan, 1 run","full and straight, worked away towards square leg."
17.4,"Kaul to Khan, FOUR runs","misfield this time. A short and wide slower ball, cut away towards short third man. Thampi runs to his right but falls over the ball."
17.3,"Kaul to Grandhomme, 1 bye","a good short slower ball, CdG misses it. Goswami fumbles and Sarfraz runs through. Good from him."
17.2,"Kaul to Grandhomme, SIX runs","clears midwicket! A badly-judged catch from Rashid. That should have been taken by tonight's standards. A full delivery outside off is skewed away off the inside half. Rashid runs in, then backtracks after misjudging it. The ball then just clears him and clears the boundary"
17.1,"Kaul to Mandeep, OUT","Dhawan takes the catch at long-off. A shortish length delivery outside off, hoicked away but with bad timing. The bat turns in his hands as well, taken by Dhawan. Easy catch."
16.6,"Shakib to Grandhomme, SIX runs","finished with six. Flat and wide outside off, CdG lofts the ball nicely and cleanly over cover. No stopping that, into the stands."
16.5,"Shakib to Grandhomme, 2 runs","wow, has he stopped that from six? The standard of fielding today is exceptional. A slog sweep looks to clear deep midwicket. Hooda is right on the boundary, sticks out his right hand and stops the momentum of the ball, his hand on its downward trajectory then pushes the ball back into the field of play."
16.4,"Shakib to Mandeep, 1 run","flat outside off, a tap to short third man."
16.3,"Shakib to Mandeep, 2 runs","same line and length, but Mandeep plays a different shot, a flick into the gap at midwicket for two."
16.2,"Shakib to Grandhomme, 1 run","flat and quick again, outside-edged to short third man"
16.1,"Shakib to Mandeep, 1 run","flat and quick outside off, pushed to cover for one. Good single, good awareness from Mandeep"
15.6,"Basil to Grandhomme, no run","edged, but short of the keeper. Well bowled to finish. Another slower ball outside off, CdG gets a bit of bat on his swing."
15.5,"Basil to Grandhomme, no run","keeps low, a back of the hand slower ball outside off. CdG waits and waits and swings, but the ball goes under"
15.4,"Basil to Grandhomme, SIX runs","that's Thampi's fifty! And what a shot to take him there. To be honest, that's a plain awful delivery. Full and straight, right in the slot. And CdG lofts the ball over long-off with a full face. Beauty!"
15.3,"Basil to Grandhomme, 2 runs","a slower delivery outside off, carved away to backward point. Carlos Brathwaite misfields and allows a second. Sloppy."
15.2,"Basil to Grandhomme, FOUR runs","CdG too going after everything. Full and wide outside off, a thick outside edge over short third man."
15.1,"Basil to Grandhomme, 2 runs","full outside off, swatted away into the gap at midwicket for two. RCB have runs 150 and 151"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, no run","a googly outside off, patted back."
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, no run","the googly down leg, ricochets off the pad into the leg side"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Ali, OUT","two in three! Rashid pulls things back. A flat googly outside off, Moeen reverse-paddles the ball from the back of the bat. It's a significant deflection, but Goswami gets his gloves to it, and parries the ball up and takes the rebound. Not the worst shot from Moeen, but another fantastic catch."
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Ali, FOUR runs","Moeen doesn't care much. A legbreak outside off, flat-batted over the umpire for four. Straight and quick."
14.2,"Rashid Khan to AB, OUT","for all the pyrotechnics of RCB batting, that is spectacular from Dhawan! Stalls this innings, quietens the crowd with a typical T20 play. Events such as this change games. And all it needs to be is a catch. A flat delivery on middle and leg, AB stays low and sweeps towards deep square leg It seems like it's lobbing over Dhawan, but he stays calm, takes the catch and ensures his balance doesn't take him over by keeping a strong centre of gravity. Awesome catch. Not as good as Boult's, but very close."
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Ali, 1 run","a shortish delivery on off, pulled over long-on"
13.6,"Sandeep to Ali, 1 run","full on leg, flicked away to deep midwicket"
13.5,"Sandeep to Ali, SIX runs","107 kph, how has that gone for six? YIKES! A slower ball outside off, a very good one. A wide knuckle ball that's just inside the tramline, it's the perfect line. But a deceived slap carries all the way over long-on"
13.4,"Sandeep to Ali, no run","well bowled, 104 kph, a gutsy slower ball outside off, right in the slot, but it's the pace that deceives Moeen. Swing and miss"
13.3,"Sandeep to AB, 1 run","127 kph, a low full toss on middle and leg, chipped to long-on"
13.2,"Sandeep to AB, FOUR runs","a very similar delivery, a slow wide delivery outside off. AB goes from bottom to top and carves the ball over backward point."
13.2,"Sandeep to AB, 1 wide","that's what he does, forces you to bowl wides. Just outside the tramline and wide. But that's a good option from Sandeep"
13.1,"Sandeep to Ali, 1 run","squeezed away towards short third man. Good stop from Thampi, to his left. A wide yorker is jammed away"
12.6,"Basil to Ali, 1 run","full and wide, carved to deep point. Timing is extraordinary."
12.5,"Basil to AB, 1 run","well bowled, a yorker on middle, pushed to long-on"
12.4,"Basil to AB, SIX runs","wow, that's stunning batting. A full toss on middle and leg, de Villiers gets low again like the previous delivery and sweeps the ball over backward square leg for a humongouuuuuus six. OUT THE GROUND! 105 metre six."
12.3,"Basil to AB, FOUR runs","it's the shot he plays when he feels at the top of his game. Remember him sweeping Steyn or Rabada or Holder? He tries it again, it's a slow delivery, he waits and pull-sweeps over short fine leg. AB at his best"
12.3,"Basil to AB, 1 wide","drifts down leg, wide. Free run."
12.2,"Basil to Ali, 1 run","superb effort from Man Pan at long-on. A full delivery on leg, swatted away into the gap, but Pandey doesn't give up on it. Runs in and almost gets there, on the bounce."
12.1,"Basil to Ali, FOUR runs","what timing. A low full toss and Moeen this time drills a drive through cover to move to fifty. His maiden IPL fifty, first-pumps from Kohli too."
11.6,"Kaul to Ali, 1 run","a shortish delivery outside off, 122 kph, slapped to long-off."
11.5,"Kaul to Ali, SIX runs","Moeen on faaaya! A short delivery on off and middle, Ali pulls fiercely and beautifully over square leg for six. A front-foot pull, that's how much T20 batting has changed."
11.4,"Kaul to AB, 1 run","a full delivery on middle, pushed to long-on. That may have been six if he decided to attack it, but the runs in the over are there so no."
11.3,"Kaul to AB, FOUR runs","another fifty for AB. And what an innings too. Just a tad short on middle, he stays back and pulls through midwicket for four. So easy "
11.2,"Kaul to AB, FOUR runs","whew, what power! My word, what a shot.A shortish delivery outside off, but not too wide. He arches his back to make room, sounds weird I know, but that's what he did and sliced a cut through point."
11.1,"Kaul to AB, 2 runs","full on off, swatted away off the inside half to deep midwicket. In the gap and two."
10.6,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","flat and quick again, on leg, reverse-swept away to third man"
10.5,"Rashid Khan to AB, no run","another googly down leg, he misses a swat. AB asks why is that not a wide with his expressions at the umpire."
10.4,"Rashid Khan to AB, no run","AB misses a sweep, gets right outside the line for just this. The googly hits the pad, but outside the line"
10.3,"Rashid Khan to Ali, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, 96 kph, very quick through the air. Hit to long-off"
10.2,"Rashid Khan to Ali, 2 runs","flat and wide, carved past point for a couple."
10.1,"Rashid Khan to Ali, SIX runs","he's taking Rashid down too! Superb batting. Runs down the pitch and goes through the line. It's the googly so he hits the ball over long-off, with the spin."
9.6,"Sandeep to Ali, 1 run","length outside off, slapped to long-off"
9.5,"Sandeep to Ali, SIX runs","a great catch from Dhawan at long-on, but he backtracks into the boundary cushion. Slapped with fierce power from Ali, flat and hard. Dhawan takes an overhead catch but goes back into the boundary for six. This is a lovely cameo"
9.4,"Sandeep to AB, 1 run","127 kph, length outside off, punched to the sweeper cover"
9.3,"Sandeep to Ali, 1 run",a length delivery outside off is slapped to long-off
9.2,"Sandeep to Ali, no run","a slower ball outside off, Ali's wild heave is missed."
9.1,"Sandeep to Ali, 2 runs","a slower delivery outside off, tapped to short third man. A throw at the batsman's end misses, resulting in an overthrow."
8.6,"Shakib to AB, no run","flat and straight again, punched to cover. Excellent over from Shakib."
8.5,"Shakib to AB, no run","signs of a slow surface, but it's very slow from Shakib too, on middle and leg, wants to hit to cover, hits to the bowler"
8.4,"Shakib to AB, no run","flat and straight, de Villiers drives back to Shakib. Well bowled again"
8.3,"Shakib to Ali, 1 run","very wide outside off, forcing Ali to drag a sweep, to deep midwicket"
8.2,"Shakib to AB, 1 run","slow on middle, AB backs away and pushes to cover."
8.1,"Shakib to Ali, 1 run","flight outside off, Ali flat-bats a slog to long-on. This is new-age T20 cricket, going after pretty much everything early in the over"
7.6,"Basil to Ali, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover from the back foot."
7.5,"Basil to AB, 1 run","on the bounce! A slower delivery on leg, 98 kph, may have been too slow for AB. Pulled to deep square leg"
7.4,"Basil to AB, FOUR runs","that's pummeled. That's his decision making again. That's why the timing is so good, that's why it's right in the gap. Digs that in short on leg, and smashed over midwicket."
7.3,"Basil to Ali, 1 run","good batting, a slower ball outside off, tapped to point for one."
7.2,"Basil to Ali, SIX runs","six more. Slightly shorter, he may have anticipated that length because of the errant first delivery. So he stays back and pulls nonchalantly over square leg. The 1-2 play, 12 runs off two balls."
7.1,"Basil to Ali, SIX runs","smashed for six! That's good, clear, proactive batting from Ali. Doesn't want to leave all the scoring to AB, so when he gets a full delivery outside off, he lofts a lofted drive over mid-off."
6.6,"Rashid Khan to Ali, 1 run","a clear sign he has no sign which way it's spinning. A lovely T20 slog sweep, inside-edged to fine leg."
6.5,"Rashid Khan to Ali, no run","the legbreak, flat and straight. Inside-edged into the pad and then back up towards the keeper."
6.4,"Rashid Khan to Ali, no run","the googly outside off, goes past Ali's cut."
6.3,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","a tad short. That's the AB 1-2. Forcing a short delivery after a good shot of the full one, pulled to square leg."
6.2,"Rashid Khan to AB, FOUR runs","it's all in the head. He premeditated that. He stayed low, got his pad outside the line in case he missed it and reverse-paddled that past slip."
6.1,"Rashid Khan to Ali, 1 run","a googly on off, tapped to cover for one. He read that well did Mo Ali."
5.6,"Kaul to AB, no run","excellently bowled, a yorker on middle, jammed out to mid-off. Very good over from Kaul."
5.5,"Kaul to AB, no run","full and straight, driven to cover."
5.4,"Kaul to AB, FOUR runs","AB's picking them before the bowler knows what he wants to bowl. As soon as he sees it's full and straight, he knows where he's going - over mid-on because the field is in. And even though it's not AB's best timing, it's good enough because his decision-making is so quick. Awesome. Just lands inside? This is taking an age from the third umpire. The 147th replay goes on screen. Woooohooo, a decision at last: it's four."
5.3,"Kaul to Ali, 1 run","on middle and off, worked to deep square leg"
5.2,"Kaul to Ali, no run","a full delivery around off, not much swing, none at all. Pushed to point."
5.1,"Kaul to Ali, no run",140 kph yorker on off. The ball that got Moeen in the 2015 World Cup against New Zealand from Southee. This time he jams down and taps to point.
4.6,"Rashid Khan to Ali, 1 run",pushed away to long-on
4.5,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, OUT","cleaned 'im up. You can't really say that often but that was poor game awareness from Kohli. He just got four against the opposition's best bowler, and went for six this time. It's a tossed up googly outside off, Kohli backs away and slogs across the line. He misses, the ball doesn't, hits off and middle stump. Maybe it was instinct or his determination to attack the best, but that wasn't the best decision he's made."
4.4,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, FOUR runs","races away. Rashid drops short, Kohli goes back and pulls over midwicket for four. Just read the length quickly."
4.3,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, no run","Williamson saves four. Flat and wide outside off, Kohli flat-bats that towards KW at mid-off. He races away and dives to his right"
4.2,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, no run","the googly on middle, worked to midwicket. Kohli comes down, AB says get back. And Virat does. Good early communication because it was the wrong call from Kohli"
4.1,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, no run","the wide yorker, going defensive from the outset. Excellent execution, goes under the bat"
3.6,"Shakib to Kohli, 1 run","too much flight there, overpitched and Kohli chooses the safer option to drive with the spin to deep cover."
3.5,"Shakib to AB, 1 run","flatter through the air around off, chipped to deep cover again"
3.4,"Shakib to Kohli, 1 run","flat and straight, some more spin but Kohli is an exceptional player of spin. Goes back and works to wide mid-on, against the spin"
3.3,"Shakib to AB, 1 run","nicely bowled actually. Very slow outside off, bowling to his field. AB drives to deep cover and gets off strike."
3.2,"Shakib to AB, no run","a good defensive ball, flat and wide, hit to cover."
3.1,"Shakib to AB, FOUR runs","the same shots he played so well against Daredevils, bad news for Sunrisers. It's full outside off, he walks across and doesn't bother about the spin because it's a cross-batted slog with so much elegance over midwicket. What do you do?"
2.6,"Sandeep to Kohli, no run","full and straight, may have been a well-executed legcutter, defended back."
2.5,"Sandeep to AB, 1 run","full and straight, he has the runs in the over so why take another risk? Too experienced for that so a checked drive to long-on."
2.4,"Sandeep to AB, no run","another slower delivery outside off, carved to short third man. Loud call of ""nooo"" from Kohli."
2.3,"Sandeep to AB, no run","doesn't want to overdo it, so he blocks a full delivery just to show he can."
2.2,"Sandeep to AB, FOUR runs","nailed! 18 off 7 now is AB. This one is full outside off, he clears his front leg and nails a lofted drive over cover. This is glorious, free stroke-making"
2.1,"Sandeep to AB, FOUR runs","wow, it's so easy for him. It's not even wide, a good length delivery on the fourth or fifth stump channel. He makes room and carves a cut through point, that's a shot Warner has owned."
1.6,"Shakib to AB, 1 run","still shortish, can go a tad fuller and try to get AB out playing a lofted drive on this surface. The short length allows AB to go back and cut towards cover for one. Excellent over from Shakib, but well played too."
1.5,"Shakib to Kohli, 1 run","lots of spin actually already. Flat and wide, it takes plenty of spin and Kohli cuts away into the off side"
1.4,"Shakib to AB, 1 run","full and flat outside off, pushed to mid-off for a run"
1.3,"Shakib to AB, no run","excellent bowling. Slows the pace up outside off, AB checks his shot. Takes a thick leading edge towards point, does not carry. Lovely flight"
1.2,"Shakib to AB, FOUR runs","just the start he had against Daredevils at this ground earlier in the season. He played the same shot against Nadeem and didn't look back. A flat delivery outside off, chipped over cover for four. Too good."
1.1,"Shakib to AB, FOUR runs","that's a fantastic start for AB. He loves it when he starts with four. A short flat delivery outside off, AB hurries back and nails a cut through point."
0.6,"Sandeep to Patel, OUT","125 kph. Sunrisers strike early. A good catch from Kaul at third man. A back of a length delivery outside off, moves away too and may have bounced a tad extra. Parthiv heaves across the line, felt like he was there a touch early too. The ball takes a thick leading edge and goes very very high - more elevation than distance - and carries down to third man, who runs to his right and takes a good catch."
0.5,"Sandeep to Kohli, 1 run","good single now. Back of a length outside off, tapped down towards point and Kohli calls his partner through."
0.4,"Sandeep to Kohli, FOUR runs","yummy! A full delivery outside off, Kohli walks down to negate the swing. It's full enough and he nails a delectable off drive. Past the bowler, past mid-off. Lovely shot."
0.3,"Sandeep to Patel, 1 run","the umpire stops four! Ump S Ravi. A full delivery on the pads, Parthiv flicks right into the knee of the square leg umpire. He just could not get out of the way."
0.2,"Sandeep to Patel, no run","on the pads from Sandeep, a hint of away shape. Worked away to midwicket"
0.1,"Sandeep to Patel, no run","good stop. Full and wide, swinging away. Parthiv goes chasing and hits the ball nicely but finds short cover. Actually, that has just carried to Hooda, to his right. The ball bursts out. Dropped!"
19.6,"McClenaghan to Tiwary, FOUR runs","it's a good shot but it won't be enough. To be fair it wouldn't be enough if he'd lifted that a few 100 metres further. Short ball into the ribs, pulled past short fine"
19.5,"McClenaghan to Axar Patel, 1 bye",misses the bouncer and is now involved in a run out appeal at the non-striker's end. Both the batsman and the bowler are caught napping. Axar beats Mitch to the stumps. Third umpire confirms he's in. But are Kings XI? Not really 
19.4,"McClenaghan to Axar Patel, SIX runs",at last! A poor ball that's been punished! Axar Patel lines up this full toss with a lot of width outside off and slaps it over long-on.
19.3,"McClenaghan to Yuvraj, OUT","holes out to sweeper cover! It's the third length ball in a row from Mitch, and this time he even gets rewarded for it. Yuvraj uses the angle and tries to go off side - ends up slicing it straight to deep extra cover"
19.3,"McClenaghan to Yuvraj, 1 wide",leaves it alone and probably skips a heartbeat! But it's well judged in the end. Length ball pushed across the wide marker
19.2,"McClenaghan to Yuvraj, no run",oh he's missed a juicy length ball outside off. That was there for the six. Yuvraj swings and can't get bat on it
19.1,"McClenaghan to Axar Patel, 1 bye",wide yorker outside off. Very wide. He swings across the line and misses. Ishan Kishan fumbles and they sneak a bye. That should have been a wide 
18.6,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","overpitched outside off, drilled straight to long-off"
18.5,"Bumrah to Yuvraj, 1 run",inside edge onto body. A short ball and a nervous poke from Yuvraj. Single pitch side on the leg side 
18.4,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","low full toss, opens up his body and punches to long-off"
18.3,"Bumrah to Rahul, OUT","he's got him! There is one hero in the Mumbai Indians team too! 2 for 12 in his fourth over before this ball. Jasprit Bumrah's slower ball has deceived Rahul again. It's in the slot - overpitched outside off - and Rahul is looking to deposit this over long-off. It's off the toe-end and is taken well inside the boundary. It's a sensational, if not legendary innings, from this man. But he's fallen with 10 balls to go."
18.2,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, dragged along the floor to long-on"
18.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","lovely bowling. Slower ball yorker. Dipping outside off, toe-ended to long-off. That wasn't the intention"
18.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 wide",slower ball. Pitches and cuts away from the wide marker. Rahul leaves
17.6,"Cutting to Rahul, 1 run","yorker outside off, jams it to extra cover from the crease"
17.5,"Cutting to Rahul, FOUR runs","genius. KL Rahul knows exactly what's coming. He's made it so - he's making the bowler do it. Another slower ball dropped short, another reverse-swipe to third man"
17.4,"Cutting to Rahul, FOUR runs",shot! Rahul with the reminder he's still around. Slower ball dropped short outside off. He swivels and reverse-swats this over short third man!
17.3,"Cutting to Rahul, FOUR runs",bye-bye! Don't. Bowl. Short. It's climbing up at Rahul's shoulder but he has swiveled much before it can get close and swatted to this to the long leg boundary
17.2,"Cutting to Axar Patel, 1 run",top edge lands well in front of deep midwicket. Short ball and he looks to pull. Hurried on it
17.1,"Cutting to Rahul, 1 run","backs away, gets a length ball. Can't make use of it. Gets it wide of long-off off the toe-end"
16.6,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, no run","short of a length outside off, driven on the up. Uppishly to extra cover."
16.5,"Bumrah to Stoinis, OUT","appeal immediately, given immediately! Bumrah has turned it on! Stoinis has no answer to this mean bouncer headed for his face. Not even close to playing a hook. It's flicked the glove before half his swing is in. He's out before he can put in a semblance of a follow through. What. An. Over."
16.4,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run",short ball in at the hips. He shovels it uppishly to deep midwicket
16.3,"Bumrah to Rahul, 2 runs","full toss outside off, driven to sweeper cover's right. It's running away, running away but so is Krunal Pandya! This family has been given the fielding gene, that's for sure. Slides to his right and keeps it in play"
16.2,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run","length ball, driven firmly back down the pitch. Deflects into the midwicket region off Bumrah's leg"
16.1,"Bumrah to Finch, OUT","good catch from Hardik Pandya. This ball has gone at least five stories up from what I can see. He has to run in from deep midwicket with half an eye on Evin Lewis who is coming in from deep square. For most of his journey, that ball is possibly just a dot in the sky. For some of it, it's swerving. And by the end, it's coming down hard. He is fully composed through it all and completes it. Good job. Finch was looking to bludgeon this length ball over deep square leg"
15.6,"Markande to Rahul, SIX runs","what pressure?, Rahul asks as he jumps down once more and sends this flying into the second tier over long-on! What a player this guy is. He hasn't got to the pitch of this after stepping out but he goes through and launches it long"
15.5,"Markande to Rahul, SIX runs",you gorgeous man! Rahul jumps down confidently to meet this length ball at leg stump and holds his shape - perfect shape - to cream this over  the straight boundary
15.4,"Markande to Rahul, 2 runs","lifts it over short third but hasn't hit it too well. Krunal pedals backwards and flicks it back for point who has given him an option. Rahul lifted this with a reverse-scoop, it was full on off stump"
15.3,"Markande to Finch, 1 run",top edge! Lands to short third man's left. He's teasing Finch here. Loopy length ball spinning away from off. He's backing into the leg side and swinging for midwicket
15.2,"Markande to Finch, 2 runs","loopy, tossed up ball on leg stump. Finch swings hard. Gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket's right comes back very casually and just makes his ground as Kishan deflects the throw onto the stumps"
15.1,"Markande to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length slider at middle stump, pushed to long-on off the back foot"
14.6,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","full on off stump, driven straight to long-off"
14.5,"Pandya to Finch, 1 run","overpitched outside off, driven hard but straight to sweeper cover"
14.4,"Pandya to Finch, no run",nice. Very nice. Steep bouncer is too much for Finch as he looks to hook. Carries nicely to Kishan
14.3,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, short and wide outside off. Mistimed cut towards sweeper cover"
14.2,"Pandya to Rahul, no run",gets it right. Well bowled. Rahul looks to clobber this length ball over midwicket from outside off. It's an offcutter that sits in the pitch and climbs past the outside edge
14.2,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 wide",another one. This one barely lands on the pitch outside off
14.2,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 wide","offcutter, very short and wide. Left alone"

13.4,"Krunal to Finch, 1 run","length on the stumps, driven to long-on"
13.3,"Krunal to Finch, FOUR runs","bludgeoned. Krunal Pandya, what are you doing sticking your hand out at that?! A full ball floated up at middle stump and the shot would have taken the bowler with it if he had miraculously reacted quick enough to get a hand on it"
13.2,"Krunal to Finch, 2 runs",short of a length ball at off. An ugly hoick from Finch. Off the inside half of the bat and running away from Cutting at deep midwicket. He sprints and lunges to his right to stop this
13.1,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","length on middle stump, clips to deep midwicket off the front foot"

12.4,"McClenaghan to Finch, FOUR runs","just clears mid-off and Cutting's slide is not enough for him to pull this back. Short ball outside off, Finch backs away and picks the right direction to go with the drive on the up - but it's off the toe-end"
12.3,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length outside off, mistimed chop to extra cover"
12.2,"McClenaghan to Rahul, FOUR runs",there it is. Rahul's newfound superpower to find boundaries behind the wicket. Short ball angled into him and he caresses it with the pace past short fine leg. Not the smartest length from the bowler with fine leg in
12.1,"McClenaghan to Finch, 1 run",length ball angled in at off stump. Skips across and whips to deep square
11.6,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 run","short of a length on middle stump, pushed towards long-on off the back foot"

11.3,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 run","length ball at middle stump. Taps it into the mid-on region and they takes off for the quick one. Mitch Mac swoops down on it from midwicket to his left, but can't get a decent throw in. Good effort"
11.2,"Bumrah to Finch, no run",short ball outside off. Looks to guide this to third man's right but finds point
11.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, punches on the up to long-on"
10.6,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","sixth fifty in seven chasing innings. Sixth in the tournament as well. Gets calmly behind this length ball and nudges to long-on. KL Rahul, once again, has got into the zone."
10.5,"Krunal to Finch, 1 run","length on middle stump, punched to long-on"
10.4,"Krunal to Finch, FOUR runs",gets on his knee and swipes right. On the cricket field that's a four. Length ball angled in at leg stump and finds the long leg boundary

8.4,"Markande to Finch, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, goes on the back foot, tickles it wide of short fine"
8.3,"Markande to Rahul, 1 run",slider on a length at middle stump. Goes on the back foot and flicks to deep midwicket
8.3,"Markande to Rahul, 1 wide",full and very wide outside off. Left alone
8.2,"Markande to Finch, 1 run",picks the googly but mis-hits the slog sweep. It trickles out to deep square

7.3,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","tossed up at middle stump, gets to the pitch and whips to deep midwicket"
7.2,"Krunal to Rahul, no run","length ball outside off, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
7.1,"Krunal to Rahul, FOUR runs",oh no. Poor bowling. Rahul's been putting these away since he was 10. Short and wide. Decent pace on it too - perfect for a square cut that is executed perfectly
6.6,"Markande to Rahul, 1 run","tossed up at off stump, leans in to drive to sweeper cover"
6.5,"Markande to Finch, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
6.4,"Markande to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length on middle stump, hurries him as he goes on the back foot and punches to deep midwicket"
6.3,"Markande to Finch, 1 run","full on the stumps, stays in the crease and pokes this into the midwicket region with soft hands"
6.2,"Markande to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length skidder at off stump, steps out and drives to long-on"
6.1,"Markande to Rahul, FOUR runs","nice. Waits and waits. It's a slow turner from Markande, but it's very short. He hangs deep and bisects backward point and short third man"
5.6,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","floated up at off stump, drives to extra cover with soft hands to steal the single"
5.5,"Krunal to Rahul, FOUR runs",oh shot. A quicker one fired down leg side. Quickly gets down on a knee and uses the pace to ramp this over short fine
5.4,"Krunal to Finch, 1 run","length ball into the pads, clipped into the square leg region"
5.3,"Krunal to Finch, no run","length on off stump, punched into the covers"
5.2,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run",dropped! An extremely difficult chance for Cutting at cover point. Rahul backs away and stabs aimlessly as this spins away from off stump. It floats high for Cutting who leaps to his right with his left-hand going at the ball and tips it over the bar
5.1,"Krunal to Rahul, FOUR runs","miscued but he doesn't need to more than clear mid-on. He does it. Beaten in flight and lofting agains the spin as he steps out, but it's one bounce and into the boundary"
4.6,"Pandya to Finch, SIX runs",oh yeah! Is that Finch getting back into form? Two controlled chops and now an old-fashioned swing across the line to send this slower ball wayyyyyy over deep midwicket. A length ball on off and he's got such a sweet connection on this
4.5,"Pandya to Finch, 2 runs",well played again. Short ball outside off and this time it's a controlled square cut. Krunal runs to his left and puts in a slide at sweeper and doesn't even bother getting off the floor as he throws it in
4.4,"Pandya to Finch, 2 runs",deftly done. Short of a length outside off and he guides it past short third man with an open face
4.3,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, pushed to cover off the back foot"
4.2,"Pandya to Finch, 1 leg bye","slower ball, short of a length and into the pads. Deflected into the leg side as he looks to play the glance"

3.6,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","slower ball, full outside off. Leans in for the drive but can't time it. Gets it straight to extra cover"
3.5,"McClenaghan to Gayle, OUT","got him! The bouncer and the catch in the deep on the leg side - just like in the last game. Rohit points his finger and sprints at Ben Cutting, the fielder who went to his right at deep square to take this miscued hook. Mitch Mac is known for this specific wicket-taking ball. It's climbing, Gayle is swatting. Gayle is gone. Wankhede has burst into celebration"
3.4,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run",out of the way quickly. A bouncer slanted in at his throat and Gayle is hopping to get out of the way. A customary air-ramp to make it look more convincing. He misses
3.3,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, full outside off. Opens the face and drives to sweeper cover"
3.2,"McClenaghan to Gayle, 1 run",short of a length and cramping him. Drags it out to long-on with a half-pull
3.1,"McClenaghan to Gayle, FOUR runs","drilled. Mitch has changed ends and changed length. It's full and in at middle stump - perfect for Gayle to have a swing at it. And he does, four on the bounce at long-on"
2.6,"Pandya to Rahul, FOUR runs","shot!/ Glorious flowing drive to beat extra cover to his left. An overpitched ball from Hardik, who has managed to be all over the place in a span of six balls. Nice transfer of weight through the forearms from Rahul as he extends them and keeps them along the floor"
2.5,"Pandya to Rahul, FOUR runs","deceived but he makes the best of it. Short of a length ball climbing up at him, a knuckle ball. He's in position to try and flick this but has to follow with his hands as it cuts away. Runs it past slip"
2.4,"Pandya to Rahul, no run","short of a length on off stump, stabbed into the off side from the crease"
2.3,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 run","short ball on leg stump, tucked behind short fine off the back foot"
2.2,"Pandya to Gayle, FOUR runs",a full-pace short ball this time. Close to off stump and he looks to cut. Thick outside edge over short third man
2.1,"Pandya to Gayle, SIX runs","boom. Pandya messes up his slower ball. It's dug very short and it's sitting up at leg stump. Gayle stands tall and slaughters it, over deep square"
1.6,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run",short of a length and in at off stump. Defended to point off the back foot
1.5,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run","beaten as he looks to carve one over point. It's a short of a length ball with some width, but it's also an offcutter that he doesn't pick"
1.4,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run","full and in at off stump. Front foot nice and close to the bat, with the full face offered. Drives straight to mid-off"
1.3,"Bumrah to Gayle, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length on leg stump. Taps it to midwicket off the back foot"
1.2,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run",nervous feet from Gayle and a slight loss of shape as he fends this away. A short of a length ball in the corridor
1.1,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run",and there's the first one. A mean bouncer spitting across him. A tad too wide to make him play though. The crowd feels it
0.6,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","short of a length on off stump, defended solidly on the back foot"
0.5,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run",disappointed with himself as he can't get this square cut past backward point. A hint of width outside off and he makes good connection on it
0.4,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run",beaten. Length ball pushed across the corridor. A lazy jab at it from Rahul and it skids past his outside edge
0.3,"McClenaghan to Rahul, SIX runs",a superb landing 50 metres behind the keeper. Rahul didn't want it to go there. Trying to tickle a short ball from his hips only to get a top edge
0.2,"McClenaghan to Gayle, 1 run",full ball in at leg stump. Stands tall to nudge this to deep square
0.1,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run",short of a length ball with some shape into the body. Jabs it into the cover off the back foot
19.6,"Sharma to Markande, 1 run",can't scoop this slower length ball past short fine.
19.5,"Sharma to McClenaghan, 1 leg bye","right into the blockhole, squeezed off the pad to the keeper. He walked across to flick but couldn't get any bat on it"
19.4,"Sharma to Markande, 1 leg bye","walks across to help this over short fine, can only get hit on the pad, they scamper a legbye"
19.4,"Sharma to McClenaghan, (no ball) 1 run",walks across and sweeps this high full toss straight to short fine leg. McClenaghan was on one knee as he looked to play the stroke but this was clearly over his waist.  Freehit coming up 
19.3,"Sharma to McClenaghan, no run","swing and a miss. Another slower length ball, looked to fetch it from outside off"
19.3,"Sharma to McClenaghan, 1 wide","looks for a slower ball, end up bowling it way outside off, rolled to the keeper"
19.2,"Sharma to Markande, 1 run","defended gently to short third man, back-of-the-hand delivery this time"
19.1,"Sharma to Markande, FOUR runs","helps this slower length ball over short third man, no one there. Cleverly done"
18.6,"Tye to McClenaghan, no run","swing and a miss. Slower and fuller outside off, he whacked the humid air instead of the ball"
18.5,"Tye to McClenaghan, no run","slower ball angling away, he looked to pull but missed"
18.4,"Tye to McClenaghan, FOUR runs","carved over point, too easy. Too full, he cleared his front leg, used the width and walloped it into the gap"
18.3,"Tye to Markande, 1 run",defended back down to long on for a single
18.2,"Tye to Pandya, OUT","the knuckleball on length, Pandya looks to cut but can only get a thick outside edge that lobs straight to Ashwin at short third man."
18.1,"Tye to Pandya, 2 runs","full toss on the pas, flicked into the deep midwicket region where Mayank Dagar, the substitute, puts out a stunning one handed stop after a dive"
18.1,"Tye to Pandya, 1 wide","slower ball gone wrong, way outside the wide line. Hardik swung and missed."
17.6,"Ashwin to McClenaghan, SIX runs","into his swinging arc as the ball drifts in from around the stumps, Mitch McClenaghan is down on one knee as he slogs this over cow corner! The carromball gone wrong this time"
17.5,"Ashwin to Pandya, 1 run","turns this flatter one on leg to square leg, they scamper a quick single"
17.4,"Ashwin to Cutting, OUT","dags the slog sweep from outside off, picks out Axar at deep midwicket. As easy as they come. Cutting was hitting this against the turn as well."

16.4,"Tye to Cutting, no run",dug in short but way over Cutting's head as he ducks

16.2,"Tye to Pandya, no run",defends solidly to cover

15.6,"Ashwin to Cutting, no run","flatter and fuller on off, defended."
15.5,"Ashwin to Pandya, 1 run","legbreak drifting into mdidle and leg, worked to deep midwicket"
15.4,"Ashwin to Cutting, 1 run",gets across a long way and paddles this full delivery to fine leg
15.3,"Ashwin to Pollard, OUT","backs away and clobbers this straight to long-off. Ashwin bowled this just slightly wide outside off as he saw Pollard backing away, he went through with the stroke but didn't hit this off the middle and Finch takes an excellent catch moving to his left at long-off."
15.2,"Ashwin to Pandya, 1 run","bowls this carrom ball wide, Pandya mistimes this slap to cover"
15.1,"Ashwin to Pandya, no run","length on middle, defended."
14.6,"Stoinis to Pollard, SIX runs","thumped over long-off, what a way to get to a half-century. This is some way to announce your return in style. Pollard is pumped, fist-pumps towards the dressing room  Clearly being left out hurt him. What a way to channel that hurt. He's delivered when his team needed him to."
14.5,"Stoinis to Pollard, FOUR runs","slower ball, the result is the same. Yuvraj can't stop it at third man despite the effort to run around and get there. Pollard saw this full, went for the big hit and sliced it over."
14.4,"Stoinis to Pollard, FOUR runs",squeezes this yorker through a thick outside edge to race away to the third man boundary. More frustration for Kings XI
14.3,"Stoinis to Pandya, 1 run",punches this full toss to wide long on
14.2,"Stoinis to Krunal, OUT","too short, sticking into the surface because this is an offcutter, Krunal into the pull early and he toe-ends this straight to short fine leg."
14.1,"Stoinis to Krunal, 2 runs",squeezes this yorker into the gap at deep midwicket
13.6,"Rajpoot to Krunal, 1 leg bye","thuds into the thigh pad as he shuffles across to whip, deflects to short fine"
13.6,"Rajpoot to Krunal, 1 wide","slower delivery but down leg, the umpire will have tougher decisions to make tonight"
13.5,"Rajpoot to Pollard, 1 run","misses his length as he goes for a yorker, hammers this straight to long off"
13.4,"Rajpoot to Pollard, FOUR runs","full toss angling into the pads and he's picked him to the deep square leg boundary. Too easy, he'll put those away even if his sleep"
13.3,"Rajpoot to Pollard, FOUR runs","drills this past the diving extra cover fielder, Finch can't stop it despite a dive. Boundary when it should've just been a single"
13.2,"Rajpoot to Pollard, SIX runs",muscled over long-on. This is brute Pollard power to the fore. Fetched it from outside off but he knew what he was doing
13.1,"Rajpoot to Krunal, 1 run",driven back towards long on
12.6,"Axar Patel to Pollard, SIX runs","backs away, Axar drifts this into his swinging arc and Pollard muscles this over deep midwicket. Onto the top tier"
12.5,"Axar Patel to Krunal, 1 run","cramped for room, forces this nevertheless through cover off the backfoot"

12.1,"Axar Patel to Pollard, 1 run",whips this flatter one to wide long on
11.6,"Stoinis to Pollard, 1 run","has he overstepped? Pulled from outside off towards deep midwicket. Apparently not, my eyes were playing tricks."
11.5,"Stoinis to Krunal, 1 run","forces this back past, down to long off"
11.4,"Stoinis to Krunal, FOUR runs","slower and fuller outside off and he's drilled this to beat long-off. Stoinis under pressure, crunching stroke that"
11.3,"Stoinis to Krunal, SIX runs","short-arm jab but wow, that has sailed over deep midwicket. Picked the length early, transferred his weight back and bang!"
11.2,"Stoinis to Krunal, SIX runs","helped up and over, just over the leaping Rajpoot at fine leg. Too short on leg stump and he just used the pace to help it along. Would've been a little nervous"
11.1,"Stoinis to Pollard, 1 run","pulled away, on the bounce to deep square leg"
10.6,"Axar Patel to Pollard, 1 run",punched down to long-on
10.5,"Axar Patel to Pollard, no run","turn and grip from length on off, defended back"

9.3,"Stoinis to Krunal, 1 run",works this off his hip towards the man coming in from wide long on

8.2,"Rajpoot to Rohit Sharma, OUT","mistimes his pull and is gone as Yuvraj takes a dolly at the edge of the ring at mid-on! Huge moment in the match. This was short, Rohit cramped for room as he looks to take him on and hit in front of square, got it high on the bat."

5.4,"Tye to Yadav, OUT","knuckleball, knuckleball and them seam-up. is there some bat on it? Yes! Two in two and Tye is on fire. Surya his hustled for pace as this skids on, he looks to play the short-arm jab to square leg but ends up getting a thick bottom edge edge that lobs off the thigh pad and is taken by the keeper."
5.3,"Tye to Ishan, OUT","cross-batted heave but he can only hit it as far as mid-on. No timing, no power, dragged it from outside off. Clever from Tye, it's that knuckleball again."

5.1,"Tye to Ishan, 1 run","steps out but is cramped for room by the length, bunted to mid-off for a quick single"

4.5,"Sharma to Ishan, SIX runs","steps out and slices this to clear deep point. Not where he wanted to hit it, but he'll take it. Wanted to go inside-out over cover. Beautiful piece of wood, I tell you"

4.2,"Sharma to Ishan, FOUR runs","draws him forward on the drive, Kishan gets a thick edge past slip to beat third man. Streaky"

2.5,"Rajpoot to Yadav, SIX runs","slower and fuller outside off, belted through the line to clear long-off. Stunning from Surya"
2.4,"Rajpoot to Yadav, SIX runs","top-edges a pull and this sails all the way. That's the shortest boundary at fine leg, around 57 metres. What does a bowler do? Hustles him for pace, causes him to rush into the stroke and then sees the ball sail away."
2.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run","defended back, bowler parries it towards cover"
2.2,"Rajpoot to Yadav, FOUR runs","pulled away handsomely. Too short, he picked the length early, swivelled back and hammered it to deep square leg"

1.1,"Sharma to Lewis, no run",slaps this length ball straight to mid-off
0.6,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run",stands tall and punches straight to cover again
0.5,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run","this time he leans into the drive, caresses it straight to Tiwary at cover"
0.4,"Rajpoot to Yadav, FOUR runs","thick outside edge, flies past a vacant second slip to the third man boundary. There for the drive, he went with hard hands, ended up slicing it."
0.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run",eases this length ball to Yuvraj at point
0.2,"Rajpoot to Lewis, 1 run","shapes back in from length, punched to point where there's a halfstop"
0.2,"Rajpoot to Lewis, 1 wide","slants a length ball away, but does so outside the wide line. Some early exercise for Maraius Erasmus"
0.1,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 run","back of length on middle, punched wide of mid-on"
17.6,"Archer to Karthik, SIX runs","hoists a short ball over long-on and take his team across the line. KKR move up to third place now in front of 61,000 of their supporters"
17.5,"Archer to Karthik, FOUR runs","outside edge flies away to the third man boundary. Gowtham does his best to stop it with a full length dive, it'll be a top effort if he has saved it. But it's unlikely  Yep, replays confirm he makes contact with the boundary while flicking the ball back"
17.4,"Archer to Karthik, no run","full on middle, whips it to midwicket"
17.3,"Archer to Russell, 1 run","low full toss, which Russell swings away to long-on"
17.2,"Archer to Russell, FOUR runs","clears the front leg and smears a half-volley outside off to the cover boundary. 145 kph coming down, several more going away"
17.1,"Archer to Karthik, 1 run",swivels on the back foot and pulls it down to long leg
16.6,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run",finds a single behind point
16.5,"Unadkat to Karthik, no run","tries to glide it fine to third man again, beaten for the second time"
16.4,"Unadkat to Karthik, no run","looks for third man again, angling the face of the bat against a shortish delivery coming into him. No connection"
16.3,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR runs","that's ridiculously good! Unadkat is bowling around the wicket, often taking all the pace off it. This one comes down at top pace, Karthik spots it and gently deflects it away to the third man boundary. Imagine your friend putting an arm around you, only to slap a sign that says ""kick me!"""
16.2,"Unadkat to Russell, 1 run",clears the front leg to smash a back of a length ball over long-on. But it's off-pace and it induces an inside edge ontp pad
16.1,"Unadkat to Russell, FOUR runs","wallops it to the point boundary, backing away against a short ball intending to cramp him. Sensational hitting, bounces only inches short of the rope"
15.6,"Stokes to Karthik, no run",defends a good length ball on middle. That's Stokes' spell - and his season - done.
15.5,"Stokes to Karthik, no run","full on off stump, knocks it down towards mid-on"
15.4,"Stokes to Russell, 1 run","full on middle, Russell knocks it away to deep midwicket"
15.3,"Stokes to Karthik, 1 leg bye","half an appeal for lbw, with DK shuffling across his crease. They pinch a legbye and soon after that's done, Royals review. It's a good length ball angling into the right-hander, beating the inside edge, and would go down with the angle past the stumps. HawkEye says it might clip, and that means umpire's call"
15.2,"Stokes to Lynn, OUT","taken at deep point! It's short. It's wide. It needs to be whacked, which Lynn tries to do. But the connection is weak. It comes off the outside half of the bottom of the bat and goes only as far as Anureet."
15.1,"Stokes to Karthik, 1 run",turns a good length ball to long-on
14.6,"Sodhi to Lynn, no run","beats him with a good length ball that drifts in on middle, grips the pitch and then zips away past the outside edge like they're mortal enemies"
14.5,"Sodhi to Lynn, 2 runs","an awkward looking sweep shot, right off middle stump. Top-edge for a couple."
14.4,"Sodhi to Lynn, no run","sees the ball lob up over his eyeline, loves the width on this, looks to smash through the covers. But the dip and turn do him in."
14.3,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run","tosses it up on middle, Karthik blocks into the covers and sprints through"
14.2,"Sodhi to Karthik, FOUR runs","pulls out the reverse sweep, and he finds the boundary with third man up in the circle. The line of this ball merits the shot - outside off. No threat to the stumps"
14.1,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run","goes inside out, but he is too close to the ball on leg stump to drive it properly through the covers"
13.6,"Archer to Lynn, FOUR runs","top edge flies away past Buttler on the right. Lynn sees another short ball that he likes, this time he goes for a pull, and still gets the runs he wants. Perhaps more considering that part of the ground is well protected"
13.5,"Archer to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, slides it down to deep third man"
13.4,"Archer to Karthik, no run",leaps off his feet to control a short ball outside off and run it down to point
13.3,"Archer to Lynn, 1 run","takes the pace off, but Lynn picks it and pulls to long-on"
13.2,"Archer to Lynn, no run","another cut shot, but this time he finds point"
13.1,"Archer to Lynn, FOUR runs",carves it to the point boundary! A little room to work with. A lot more pace to take advantage of. And the old Chris Lynn. The man nearly everyone comes to watch at the Gabba in the BBL pops out to prove it really is him
12.6,"Anureet to Karthik, FOUR runs","full, wide, smash and the ball disappears to the cover boundary. Karthik's skills in finishing a chase are fairly incredible"
12.5,"Anureet to Lynn, 1 run","full on off stump, bunts it down to long-on"
12.4,"Anureet to Karthik, 1 run",nudges a shortish delivery outside off to long-on

12.2,"Anureet to Lynn, 1 run",reaches out to the short ball outside off and pummels it to deep square leg.
12.1,"Anureet to Karthik, 1 run",rolls his wrists to adjust to the slower ball on off stump and sends it skipping away through midwicket
11.6,"Unadkat to Lynn, no run",blocks a shortish delivery on middle to point
11.5,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run","makes sure to play close to the body, which is important against someone with good slower balls, and finds a single at midwicket"
11.4,"Unadkat to Lynn, 1 run",glides a full delivery on off stump to deep third man
11.3,"Unadkat to Lynn, FOUR runs","picks the slower ball, sees fine leg up in the circle, and exploits it all beautifully with a pull shot. Lovely roll of the wrists, perfect placement, because deep square leg is also lurking."
11.2,"Unadkat to Lynn, no run","pushes, with an open face, and this good length ball on off stump goes to point"
11.1,"Unadkat to Lynn, no run",blocks a back of a length delivery from round the wicket to cover
10.6,"Sodhi to Lynn, 1 run","bounces short of long-on, where K Gowtham races in seeing Lynn loft a short and wide ball in his direction."
10.5,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run","full and outside off, drives to deep point"
10.4,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run","tosses it up on middle and off, DK stretches forward to block"
10.3,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run","almost to the slip fielder! DK sets up for a pull because this is slow and short, but then the ball breaks sharply, and as a result, he has to dab it down into the off side. Does so well enough to beat Stokes"
10.2,"Sodhi to Lynn, 1 run",shifts over to off stump to deal with Sodhi's big-turning legbreaks and whips this through midwicket
10.1,"Sodhi to Lynn, no run","beats him with a gorgeous legbreak, pretending to come into the right-hander a little way and then it pitches and changes direction. Gloriously fickle."
9.6,"Unadkat to Karthik, no run",looks to smack the wide length ball on the up through the covers. But there is no contact
9.5,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR runs",gets his hands up high to deal with the bounce on this back of a length delivery and somehow drives it through the covers. Superb timing
9.4,"Unadkat to Lynn, 1 run","offcutter again, which Lynn glides to the sweeper cover"
9.3,"Unadkat to Lynn, no run","slower bouncer, moving across the right-hander, Lynn ignores it"
9.2,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length on leg stump, Karthik deflects it to fine leg"
9.1,"Unadkat to Lynn, 1 run","full and outside off, knocks it down the pitch towards where mid-off would have been"
8.6,"Sodhi to Karthik, 2 runs","goes for a sweep, dragging a well flighted delivery from outside off over to deep midwicket. And he even pinches an extra run"
8.5,"Sodhi to Karthik, no run","lovely drift into the right-hander, but Karthik stretches forward to cover it and blocks with soft hands"
8.4,"Sodhi to Lynn, 1 run","full on off stump, he pushes it off the front foot through to the sweeper cover"
8.3,"Sodhi to Karthik, 1 run",rocks back to cut a shortish delivery to the sweeper cover
8.2,"Sodhi to Rana, OUT","huge appeal for lbw. Umpire Dharmasena says no but Royals want a second look. Regardless of what happens, this is a lovely delivery. Sodhi slows it up, and as a result, gets it to drift away. That drift has Rana nervous. He has no stride, he is playing outside the line as if he thinks this is a googly, but the ball turns sharply to pin him on the front pad and HawkEye shows it is hitting leg stump. Decision overturned. Royals rising."
8.1,"Sodhi to Lynn, 1 run",flicks a quicker delivery on top of off stump through midwicket
7.6,"Gowtham to Lynn, 1 run","full on off stump, flicks to long-on"
7.5,"Gowtham to Rana, 1 run","fires it in from around the wicket, Rana reads the trick early and chops it behind point"
7.4,"Gowtham to Rana, SIX runs","lifts it over extra cover! It's the footwork again, bravely jumping down the pitch and this time hitting with the turn, perhaps because he isn't right to the pitch of this ball on off stump"
7.3,"Gowtham to Lynn, 1 run",stands back to punch a flatter delivery on off stump to long-on
7.2,"Gowtham to Rana, 1 run","shimmies down, reaching the pitch of the ball on off stump, and since he's right on top of it, he can work it against the turn through midwicket"
7.1,"Gowtham to Lynn, 1 run",yanks a full delivery from outside off through midwicket
6.6,"Sodhi to Rana, no run","on middle and leg, defended back."
6.5,"Sodhi to Rana, no run","the googly around off, 82 kph. Rana looks for the big slog sweep but all he can do is chop it back into his body"
6.4,"Sodhi to Rana, FOUR runs","that's four. Always four when it beats the fielder. It's short and wide, reads it very carefully and correctly. Goes back and slashes his cut through point."
6.3,"Sodhi to Lynn, 1 run","shortish delivery outside off, short enough for Lynn to go back and read the ball off the pitch. Worked to wide long-on"
6.2,"Sodhi to Lynn, no run","80.5 kph. Very hard hands from Lynn, which is why that ball almost popped back. A legbreak on middle, Lynn blocks and almost carries back to Ish."
6.1,"Sodhi to Rana, 1 run","the googly, read by Rana. He goes back and carves a cut to point"
5.6,"Stokes to Rana, 1 run","on middle and leg, worked into the gap at wide mid-on for a single."
5.5,"Stokes to Rana, no run","back of a length around off, 135 kph, defended into the off side. Rana happy to play this out."
5.5,"Stokes to Rana, 1 wide","a slower ball that drifts down leg, wide."
5.4,"Stokes to Lynn, 1 run","another slower ball, shortish and wide, cut to the sweeper cover fielder."
5.3,"Stokes to Rana, 1 run","full on middle and off, 140 kph, nudged away towards midwicket."
5.2,"Stokes to Lynn, 1 run","back of a length outside off, punched away towards cover. The fielder dives to his left but falls over the ball."
5.1,"Stokes to Lynn, no run","a good slower ball, 109 kph, some loop and dip on that. Ends up floating like a butterfly, and jamming down on Lynn as he blocks."
4.6,"Archer to Rana, 2 runs",does it again! Backs away and chops a cut into the ground towards point for a couple.
4.5,"Archer to Rana, FOUR runs","149.6 kph. Back of a length on middle, Rana backs away, clears his front leg and carves a cut wide of backward point, to his left. That's his strength and he played to that."
4.4,"Archer to Rana, no run","good stop by Tripathi. Full and wide outside off, caressed away towards cover. Tripathi dives to his left"
4.3,"Archer to Rana, no run","and again! 146 kph, back of a length outside off, the ball pitches and moves away again. Beaten quite convincingly"
4.2,"Archer to Rana, no run",the beautiful Test 1-2! A nice full delivery that pitches and moves away. Rana's feet are rooted and his drive is beaten
4.1,"Archer to Rana, no run","Rana too has struggled against the bouncer already this IPL. A bouncer outside off, Rana avoids that watchfully."
3.6,"Stokes to Lynn, FOUR runs","too full and Lynn says why bother bowling there? An overpitched, hit-me, half-volley outside off. Lynn gently drills the drive through cover for four."
3.5,"Stokes to Uthappa, OUT","taken at deep square leg! 144 kph, it's another short delivery. Another well-directed bouncer. Uthappa struggles to time the ball or keep it down. He does neither and picks out the fielder. Stokes is using that length exceptionally well. Harried for pace."
3.4,"Stokes to Uthappa, 2 runs",nice timing. On the pads and flicked away nonchalantly into the gap at midwicket for two.
3.3,"Stokes to Lynn, 1 run","doesn't carry to mid-on! Another good delivery, back of a length on the body. He is so rushed on that that he splices the ball towards midwicket. Mid-on can't get around in time to catch"
3.2,"Stokes to Lynn, no run","keeps low? Back of a length down leg, Lynn looks to pull, but the ball keeps a tad low. He is hit on the thigh or midriff"
3.1,"Stokes to Uthappa, 1 run","good single. Full and straight, pushed away to mid-on for a single."
2.6,"Archer to Lynn, no run","147 kph, short around off, patted back"
2.5,"Archer to Lynn, FOUR runs","147 kph. ""That's not the plan with third man up,"" says Warne with the host broadcaster. That indeed is a terrible plan. A short delivery outside off, Lynn just stays underneath the length and lofts the ball over short third man. Lands just inside"
2.4,"Archer to Lynn, SIX runs","the look-away pull six from Lynn. Archer attacks the badge, it's a very good bouncer. But that's the risk on grounds like these. Lynn is hurried, he takes his eyes off the ball and then top-edges the pull over backward square leg."
2.3,"Archer to Uthappa, 1 run","shortish and wide outside off, slashed down to third man for a run"
2.2,"Archer to Uthappa, no run","just short of Buttler! Back of a length outside off, Uthappa looks to guide this down to third man, an under edge is collected on the bounce."
2.1,"Archer to Uthappa, no run","full and straight, on-driven away to mid-on. Not the greatest timing"
1.6,"Stokes to Lynn, no run","a slower ball down leg, nudged down to short fine leg. 0 off 5. Wicket maiden from Stokes."
1.5,"Stokes to Lynn, no run","a full delivery on middle and leg, chipped away to mid-on. Not found his fluency at all."
1.4,"Stokes to Lynn, no run","lovely shot, lovely stop. Shortish and wide outside off, carved away towards backward point."
1.3,"Stokes to Lynn, no run",a full delivery outside off is driven to extra cover.
1.2,"Stokes to Narine, OUT","Gowtham takes the catch and sends Narine off. 21 off 7, that's three runs a ball. Job done from Narine. But that's the length to bowl to Narine. Another short delivery outside off, Narine backs away and mis-times a pull. He was clearly rushed for pace there, and all he could do was splice the pull to cover."
1.1,"Stokes to Narine, no run",that's how Narine plays the short deliveries. Gets outside the line and tries to hit short deliveries over point. Misses.
0.6,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run","flat and quick outside off, Lynn blocks."
0.5,"Gowtham to Narine, 1 run","too close to that! BOOO! Full and straight, Narine comes down and hits to long-on. All along the ground."
0.4,"Gowtham to Narine, FOUR runs","flat on middle and leg, Narine backs away and slaps the ball over cover. Flat-batted glory for Narine. Bludgeoning both lengths."
0.3,"Gowtham to Narine, SIX runs","toe-ended away over long-on. Narine is looking at the bottom of the bat. He runs down, gets close enough to the pitch and lofted pretty cleanly over long-on for six! Job done? 16 off 3."
0.2,"Gowtham to Narine, FOUR runs","flat and straight, around leg. Pulled over square leg for four. Lands just inside the boundary."
0.1,"Gowtham to Narine, SIX runs","first ball six! Block the first ball? Watch the spin? Play with a straight bat? No, says Narine. It's full, straight and T20d away over midwicket for six. Too full and heaved away"
18.6,"Prasidh to Unadkat, OUT","that's it. A slower ball crashes into middle stump as Unadkat looks for a slog sweep. Misses it completely, but the umps are going to check on the no-ball. He's fine. Innings over."
18.5,"Prasidh to Anureet, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, carves it to the sweeper cover"
18.4,"Prasidh to Unadkat, 1 run","full toss on off stump, Unadkat whacks it to long-on"
18.3,"Prasidh to Anureet, 1 leg bye",strikes him on the pad as Unadkat is late on the flick shot.
18.2,"Prasidh to Unadkat, 1 run","full toss on off stump, he carves it to sweeper cover"
18.1,"Prasidh to Anureet, 1 run","slower ball off the back of the hand, dipping on the right-hander. Anureet defends in front of middle and gets a single"
17.6,"Russell to Anureet, 1 run","full toss on middle, Anureet slices it to sweeper cover"
17.5,"Russell to Unadkat, 1 run",pushes it down the ground
17.4,"Russell to Unadkat, no run","dropped by Krishna running in from cover. This is the quicker ball, and it that should have got a wicket. Unadkat is beaten for pace. He's swinging hard because it's short and outside off. But it goes straight up. There's an age for Krishna to get under it, but it pops out"
17.3,"Russell to Archer, OUT","goes for the slog, but he is deceived by the change of pace, and so goes up instead of long. Gill is coming in from long leg and takes it ever so cleanly"
17.2,"Russell to Archer, no run","legcutter, which Archer picks, but the lack of room means he can only find cover"
17.1,"Russell to Unadkat, 1 run",steers a back of a length delivery on and around off stump to deep point
16.6,"Prasidh to Archer, 2 runs",whips it straight down the ground for a couple
16.5,"Prasidh to Archer, no run","full on off stump, defends"
16.4,"Prasidh to Archer, FOUR runs",short-arm pulls it away to the square leg boundary. For half a second he seems cramped for room as the short ball comes up to his hips. But the bottom hand makes up for all that
16.3,"Prasidh to Sodhi, OUT","appeal for the weirdest caught behind ever with KKR thinking the ball has come off the bottom edge, onto boot and then to the keeper. Soft signal is not out. The fun starts with a yorker, that Sodhi inside edges onto his back boot, bounces off his back pad and settles in DK's hands. Third umpire rules it out, rightly. Boy, if ever there was a sign that this game is KKR's "
16.2,"Prasidh to Sodhi, no run",swings looking for the midwicket boundary but is utterly deceived by a slower ball. Goes through between the leg stump and the batsman's back thigh
16.1,"Prasidh to Sodhi, no run",looks for the pull as he sees a short ball with some room outside off. No connection
15.6,"Narine to Unadkat, FOUR runs",over the fielder at point! Unadkat is 22 from 12! And he's played some sparkling shots. Like rasping cut to a short and wide delivery.
15.5,"Narine to Sodhi, 1 run",tucks this off middle to deep square leg
15.4,"Narine to Sodhi, no run",waits until the very last second so he can read the turn off the pitch and then dabs the shortish delivery outside off to short third man
15.3,"Narine to Unadkat, 1 run",backs away as he cuts the shortish delivery turning into the stumps. Single to the sweeper
15.2,"Narine to Unadkat, FOUR runs","width on offer and Unadkat lashes it to the point boundary. Lovely placement, picks the gap to the right of the man inside the circle and to the left of the sweeper"
15.1,"Narine to Unadkat, no run",spins away from the right-hander and he slices it to the left of backward point
14.6,"Shivam Mavi to Unadkat, 1 run",gets right behind a back of a length delivery on middle and finds a single at mid-off
14.5,"Shivam Mavi to Unadkat, no run","slower ball on off stump, Unadkat picks it and blocks down the pitch"
14.4,"Shivam Mavi to Unadkat, no run","full on middle and off stump, Unadkat smokes it to cover"
14.3,"Shivam Mavi to Unadkat, SIX runs","steps away on the leg side and pulls a bouncer that is following him, coming up towards his head, away to the deep square leg boundary. DK rushes up to his young bowler to have an urgent chat"
14.2,"Shivam Mavi to Unadkat, FOUR runs","spears it through the covers, Unadkat showing how its done. Stands still on leg stump, opens the face to place it to the right of the fielder"
14.1,"Shivam Mavi to Unadkat, no run","back of a length on middle, he clips to short midwicket"
13.6,"Kuldeep to Sodhi, no run","tosses it up on off stump, Sodhi comes forward to block. That's the end of a supremely good spell of spin bowling."
13.5,"Kuldeep to Stokes, OUT","pops it back to the bowler! Fourth wicket for Kuldeep! This angle from around the wicket to Stokes has really been messing with him. The left-hander keeps playing the original line, with each ball pitching on leg stump, but since he isn't reading the ball out the hand, and with his team in tatters, he cannot attack. He can only nudge. Goes for a little flick, but there is just enough gap between the ball and bat for it to turn, claim a bit of the leading edge and return to where it came from."
13.4,"Kuldeep to Unadkat, 1 run",works it away to deep square leg
13.3,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run","defends on middle stump, but since he isn't to the pitch of the ball, which is also a googly, he ends up playing outside the line and gets an inside edege through square leg"
13.2,"Kuldeep to Unadkat, 1 run",sweeps a length ball on off stump out to long leg.
13.1,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run","loops it up on leg stump, from around the wicket, Stokes makes room and drives to long-on"
12.6,"Shivam Mavi to Gowtham, OUT",bounces him out! Hostile stuff! Gowtham has shown he is outrageously good at dispatching anything in his half out of the park. So makes perfect sense to test him with the short ball. And Mavi's really quick too. Gets it to come up towards his throat. Gowtham shuffles inside the line and tries to fend it away to fine leg. Only gloves it through to the keeper
12.5,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, 1 run","short on middle, Stokes dabs it through point"
12.4,"Shivam Mavi to Gowtham, 1 run",opens the face and glides the short of a length ball outside off to deep third man
12.3,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, 1 run",strays on the pads and Stokes whips it away to deep square leg
12.2,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, no run","slower ball, and Stokes, who is stuck in the crease, mistimes it to mid-off"
12.1,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, no run","back of a length and outside off, Stokes chops it to point"
11.6,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run",goes back to flick a flatter delivery outside off through midwicket
11.5,"Kuldeep to Gowtham, 1 run",goes back to flick a good length ball behind square leg
11.4,"Kuldeep to Gowtham, no run","another googly! Gowtham presses forward to defend, thinking it will spin into him, but the ball darts past the outside edge and into the keeper's gloves"
11.3,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run",looks to nudge it through wide mid-on as Kuldeep goes around the wicket. Gets a leading edge down to long-off
11.2,"Kuldeep to Gowtham, 1 run","full and on off stump, works it down to long-on"
11.1,"Kuldeep to Binny, OUT","sensational googly! Binny does not pick it. He's lunging out of his crease, searching for ball so he could flick it through midwicket. But it just does not behaves the way he thinks it would. Drifts past the edge. Pitches and spins further. DK is ready and waiting behind the stumps and well "
10.6,"Narine to Binny, 1 run",stays back now and works the length ball from off stump through midwicket
10.5,"Narine to Binny, no run","lunges forward to block a tossed up offbreak and is surprised by the dip on it. Binny thinks he can get to the pitch, but suddenly has to use his wrists to keep the ball down"
10.4,"Narine to Binny, no run","good length and outside off, Binny lets it go"
10.3,"Narine to Samson, OUT","appeal for lbw as Samson sets up a pull shot. He is hitting with the turn, but the ball skids through and strikes him on the pads. DK wants to review. The impact is on the back leg, which is right in line with off stump, and HawkEye says it's hitting the stumps as well. Umpire Anil Chaudhary will have to change his on-field not-out decision"
10.2,"Narine to Stokes, 1 run","length ball on leg stump, Stokes flicks it away to deep midwicket"
10.1,"Narine to Stokes, 2 runs","on the pads, spinning away from the left-hander. Stokes works it through midwicket"
9.6,"Kuldeep to Samson, FOUR runs","steps leg side, then back in normal position at the crease and sweeps a length ball in line with the stumps to the square leg boundary"
9.5,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run","full and on and around off stump, Stokes hits to long-on"
9.4,"Kuldeep to Samson, 1 run",full toss outside off which Samson slaps down to long-off
9.3,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run",nice and full to the new batsman and Stokes jams it down the ground
9.2,"Kuldeep to Buttler, OUT","reverse sweeps . straight to short third man! He was 11 runs away from becoming the first batsman in the IPL to score six fifties in a row. But with the run-rate slipping, with wickets falling, he knows it is up to him to shake Royals out of their funk. Goes for the unorthodox shot - a shot he's very confident playing - but the ball out the front of the hand bounces a little more than he expects"
9.1,"Kuldeep to Buttler, no run",nice drift away from the right-hander and that is what makes Buttler a tad bit tentative. Reaches out to it and blocks as carefully as he could
8.6,"Prasidh to Samson, no run","a straight, very full delivery is jammed back to the bowler."
8.5,"Prasidh to Samson, no run","back of a length on middle and off, that's a better line. And therefore, earns a dot ball too. Pushed to cover."
8.4,"Prasidh to Samson, FOUR runs","back of a length outside off, 138 kph. A thick outside edge flies down to the third man boundary. He did attempt to open the face, but was that intentional? Don't think so."
8.3,"Prasidh to Buttler, 1 run","a very full delivery on off, pushed to long-on"
8.2,"Prasidh to Buttler, no run","back of a length outside off, 137 kph, some width. Krishna may want to avoid that line. Cut away towards backward point"
8.1,"Prasidh to Samson, 1 run","back of a length outside off, Samson opens the bat face and guides that down to third man for a run"
7.6,"Kuldeep to Samson, 1 run","that's too short, easy enough to read off the pitch. A stock delivery on middle and leg, worked to square leg"
7.5,"Kuldeep to Buttler, 1 run","on leg stump, worked to deep midwicket. Buttler may just look to bat for a bit now."
7.4,"Kuldeep to Samson, 1 run","the stock delivery, around off. Worked away to square leg for one"
7.3,"Kuldeep to Samson, no run","the conventional paddle sweep, Sanju tries first up. It's the googly, hits Samson on the body"
7.2,"Kuldeep to Rahane, OUT","80 kph, that's a weird shot. Is that a shot he plays well? I don't think so, which makes that reverse sweep a weird attempt. Looks to reverse sweep that ball - a lofted googly - through point. It's on leg stump too, indicating that was a premeditated shot. He misses, but the ball hits leg and middle stump. Kuldeep has confidence now, that's dangerous."
7.1,"Kuldeep to Rahane, 2 runs","doesn't bother with the straight bat. A stock delivery on off, Rahane stays low and sweeps to deep square leg for a couple."
6.6,"Russell to Buttler, no run","a full toss to finish. A quick one. Pushed back to the bowler, taken aback by the lack of accuracy"
6.5,"Russell to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length around off, some extra bounce. Punched to long-on."
6.4,"Russell to Rahane, 2 runs","a slower ball around off, worked wide of midwicket for a couple. Long-on had a lot of ground to cover"
6.3,"Russell to Rahane, no run","backs away, exposes his stumps and drills a drive to cover. A very good stop from Uthappa."
6.2,"Russell to Rahane, 2 runs","back of a length on off, nudged away towards midwicket, Rahane calls for two and makes it. Well placed, well run"
6.1,"Russell to Buttler, 1 run","full outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover."
5.6,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR runs","breaks that pressure with a neat flick through backward square leg. Was an exceptional over till that point, but the line was errant and Rahane's off"
5.5,"Narine to Rahane, no run","more dots! A carrom ball outside off, worked to midwicket. Karthik sends him back for the last ball."
5.4,"Narine to Rahane, no run","looks to slog sweep, but makes no contact. Slow and wide outside off, the ball turns back in. Rahane misses, so does Karthik"
5.3,"Narine to Rahane, no run","make that three. It's the carrom ball, short outside off, bunted away to mid-off"
5.2,"Narine to Rahane, no run","slow around off, worked to midwicket. Two dots for Rahane."
5.1,"Narine to Buttler, 1 run","shortish and wide outside off, some spin back in. Pushed away towards cover for a quick single"
4.6,"Russell to Rahane, no run","back of a length outside off. Russell sticking with that length. Guides to gully, on the bounce."
4.5,"Russell to Tripathi, OUT","gloved and gone! Eden Gardens goes wild. A short delivery down leg, Russell was quick and hustling. Tripathi is hurried on the pull and eventually, he can only get a glove on his pull, through to DK. That's a massive wicket, primarily because it's some relief."
4.4,"Russell to Buttler, 1 run","back of a length on off, tapped away towards backward point for a quick single. Hit his glove almost. Seems that's the length to bowl here, hit the deck!"
4.3,"Russell to Tripathi, 1 run","a low full toss, down the leg side. Tripathi misses a flick somehow, off the pad to third man"
4.2,"Russell to Tripathi, 2 runs","a slower ball, on the pads. worked away with soft hands into the gap in front of square leg for two."
4.1,"Russell to Tripathi, no run","slingy action. Full and wide outside off, Tripathi wants to play then bails out."
3.6,"Narine to Buttler, FOUR runs","too full this time outside off. Buttler stays low and bottom-hands that drive away through wide mid-off. How he gets so much power on that is down to that bottom hand. In the slog overs, he would just loft that shot for six. He doesn't need to against Narine."
3.5,"Narine to Buttler, no run","that's the better line. Some sarcastic cheers ring around the Eden Gardens. Flat and straight, blocked"
3.5,"Narine to Buttler, 1 wide","drifts well down leg for a wide. Good take from Karthik, to his left."
3.4,"Narine to Tripathi, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, tapped to third man for a run."
3.3,"Narine to Tripathi, no run","a full delivery on middle, punched to cover from the crease."
3.2,"Narine to Tripathi, FOUR runs","11 in 12! A full delivery outside off, an offbreak. Tripathi stays low and swats the delivery over midwicket for four. Almost went for six."
3.1,"Narine to Tripathi, no run","DOT BALL! Full and wide, an offbreak, pushed to cover from the crease"
2.6,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, FOUR runs","10 boundaries in 10 balls! Wow, what a start for Royals. Probably his best delivery, close to a wide yorker but why would you want to bowl that with third man up? Buttler sees the ball early and scythes the ball through backward point."
2.5,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, SIX runs","nine in nine! 45 runs in 2.5 overs. Buttler backs away, then shuffles right back in line and scoops a straight delivery over fine leg for six. Too easy for Jos."
2.4,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, FOUR runs","yikes, that's an ugly flat-batted mow through midwicket. A slow, shortish delivery outside off is slapped wide of midwicket."
2.3,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, FOUR runs","a poor ball. Royals are flying. Short and wide outside off, Buttler slices an upper cut over point. Bad bowling."
2.2,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, SIX runs","that's a shot he's really good at. For Lancashire, for Somerset, for England, for Royals. Walks right across and just scoops a fast bowler over fine leg for six. How easy does batting look?"
2.1,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, FOUR runs","short and wide, 139 kph. Buttler backed away too far and so had to stretch out too far to get bat on it. He gets that: a top edge and it flies over short third man."
1.6,"Prasidh to Tripathi, FOUR runs","that's splendid. Full and straight again, don't think that's the length you want to bowl here. Tripathi says thanks with a delightful, delectable on-drive through mid-on."
1.5,"Prasidh to Tripathi, FOUR runs","how has that gone for four? 143 kph, full on off, a bit of seam too. Tripathi now wants to work that ball through midwicket, but that away movement takes the outside edge and flies through gully!"
1.4,"Prasidh to Tripathi, FOUR runs","and now he gets a poor delivery. Short and wide, plenty of width. Carved away past backward point. Earned that error with a calculated risk off the previous ball"
1.3,"Prasidh to Tripathi, SIX runs","that's what T20s are all about. Anticipation. The first ball of the over was tidy and straight. So Tripathi backs away and hopes it's there again. It is. He slices a carve off a full, straight delivery over point. Fantastic batting"
1.2,"Prasidh to Buttler, 1 run","good length outside off, 138 kph. He's generating decent speed. Pushed away towards cover for a quick, and well-judged single."
1.1,"Prasidh to Buttler, no run","full, on middle. Defended towards mid-on. Nice start."
0.6,"Shivam Mavi to Tripathi, no run","back of a length, the ball pitches and seams back in after pitching. Tripathi wants to play the ball into the off side but didn't account for that movement. The ball snakes in to hit Tripathi on the body, near the neck."
0.5,"Shivam Mavi to Tripathi, no run","hitting the hard length. Back of a length down leg, hustles Tripathi for pace. Hits him on the body as he misses a flick."
0.4,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 1 run","good single. Back of a length around off, the ball seams back in. An inside edge into the pad, trickles back towards the keeper. Tripathi calls Buttler through."
0.3,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, no run","back of a length outside off, Buttler stays back and carves the ball to point. No feet movement, not much at least."
0.2,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, no run","a full, wide delivery outside off, Buttler looks to drive through the line but jabs it back"
0.1,"Shivam Mavi to Tripathi, 1 run","what a start! Did Rana get some hand on it? A back of a length delivery on middle and leg, it bounced and took off. Took the shoulder of the bat, towards Rana's right at wide slip. Somehow, the ball bursts out. That will go down as a drop."
8.1,"Rajpoot to Kohli, FOUR runs","that's the win. A bouncer wide outside off, he looks to hook, it's too big on him. Top edge over the keeper"
8.1,"Rajpoot to Kohli, (no ball)","dropped but it's also a no-ball. Kohli doesn't run. It's high and outside off, he lifts a simple catch for long-off who comes in, makes the ground, gets to the ball and then fails to hold on. Would have been game over if he had run there"
7.6,"Tye to Kohli, 1 run","full on off stump, drives to long-on"
7.5,"Tye to Patel, 1 run","slower short ball at middle stump, hangs back and pulls to deep square"
7.4,"Tye to Patel, FOUR runs",guided. Bouncer in the corridor. Parthiv arches backwards to make room and ramps it to the third man boundary
7.3,"Tye to Patel, no run",beaten. Another slower ball dying on the batsman from back of a length. Patel swings and it skids through from under his bat
7.2,"Tye to Kohli, 1 run","knuckle ball at a length, wide outside off. Steps out and mistimes a drive to long-off"
7.1,"Tye to Patel, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, dabs it to third man off the outside half"
6.6,"Stoinis to Kohli, FOUR runs",a short ball just outside off. Kohli onto the front foot to pummel this to deep midwicket's left with a flat bat
6.5,"Stoinis to Patel, 1 leg bye","length on middle stump, looks to whip it, deflected pitch side off the pad"
6.4,"Stoinis to Patel, 2 runs",falls short of Mayank at deep midwicket. Parthiv miscues a pull. That gets too big on him. Slices it uppishly and it hangs enticingly for the fielder who pauses just a fraction before sprinting in and putting in a dive forward
6.3,"Stoinis to Kohli, 1 run","length on the stumps, tapped to long-on"
6.2,"Stoinis to Kohli, FOUR runs",short and wide. Waits for it to arrive. Opens the face very late to get it past point
6.1,"Stoinis to Patel, 1 run","short ball just outside off, pulled on the up to long-on's left. Supremely timed"
5.6,"Tye to Kohli, SIX runs","ohhhhh yesssss! Last ball of the Powerplay crunched over the long-off boundary. Kohli backs away to get full swinging room at this overpitched ball on off. Brings out the full swing too to lift this, flat"
5.5,"Tye to Kohli, FOUR runs","easy.  Short ball just outside off, third man is in. Opens the face and beats him"
5.4,"Tye to Kohli, no run","lovely bouncer has Kohli falling away into the leg side to get his head out of the way as he leaves. Of course, then he appears incensed that isn't a wide"
5.3,"Tye to Patel, 1 run","inside edge onto pad, into the midwicket region. Parthiv looking to go behind square again. It's a full ball on middle stump"
5.2,"Tye to Kohli, 1 run","length ball at the stumps, punched down to long-on"
5.1,"Tye to Kohli, no run",steps out and yorks himself. Length ball outside off and he's forced to jam it into the covers
4.6,"Sharma to Patel, FOUR runs",a whip that's blazed away to the backward square boundary! Mohit drops it short and can't get enough height on the attempted bouncer
4.5,"Sharma to Patel, FOUR runs","nicely done Parthiv. Top skill to adjust for the slower ball after getting in position for the hook. He's falling into the off side a tad, but he keeps his eyes on it and steers it past short fine"
4.4,"Sharma to Kohli, 1 run",full toss on middle stump and he manages only a feeble push out to deep midwicket
4.3,"Sharma to Patel, 1 run",short ball skids on too quickly for him. Attempted hook deflected towards short fine off the glove
4.2,"Sharma to Patel, FOUR runs",drilled. Parthiv lives for this - a full ball with lots of width outside off. Half a stride before getting very fast hands through this to get it to the cover boundary
4.1,"Sharma to Kohli, 1 run",slower ball to start. Short of a length and just outside off. Pulls to deep midwicket off the inside half
3.6,"Tye to Patel, no run",inside edge trickles past the stumps and rolls to short fine. Parthiv looking to flay one behind point but it's a knuckle ball
3.5,"Tye to Kohli, 1 leg bye","oh this looks plumb. It's not given and Ashwin reviews straight away. If there's no bat on this, I reckon Kohli will be in some trouble. Misses a length ball headed for leg stump as he plants the front foot across oh it's going down! That looked closer in real time. Turns out it's a very good decision. Among other things, Kings XI have lost their review now as well"
3.4,"Tye to Kohli, no run",bouncer climbs over his right shoulder. Nice height on that. Too steep for Kohli to try and hook
3.3,"Tye to Patel, 1 run","length ball just outside off, pulls but it's too quick. Hits the high part of the bat and trickles out to mid-on"
3.2,"Tye to Patel, no run",slashes and misses. Knuckle ball again. Grips on the pitch and climbs over his attempted square drive on the up
3.1,"Tye to Kohli, 1 run",beaten in pace as he steps out. It's a knuckle ball from Tye that stops on him and he's forced to fend into the covers off the outside half
2.6,"Rajpoot to Patel, no run",well bowled. Length ball in the corridor beats the inside edge as Parthiv opens the face for the square drive
2.5,"Rajpoot to Kohli, 1 run",dropped. Finch lunges to his right at mid-off but can't hold onto this miscued shot. Kohli steps out again and turns this into a full toss. But his attempted shot is right off the toe-end and he ends up chipping it
2.4,"Rajpoot to Kohli, FOUR runs",slices over the off-side infield. Rajpoot getting special treatment. Length ball on off stump and Kohli is jumping down the pitch before if lands. Makes room and carves it over point
2.4,"Rajpoot to Kohli, 1 wide","length ball pushed well down leg side, won't get bat on it, will get a run"
2.3,"Rajpoot to Kohli, no run","length on middle stump, taps it to mid-on's right on the up"
2.2,"Rajpoot to Kohli, FOUR runs","now he stays still and goes along the ground through midwicket. Short of a length ball at off stump, a short-arm pull past mid-on. Not timed too well, but it's a small ground"
2.1,"Rajpoot to Kohli, SIX runs","boom! Kohli was setting up for that shot with Rajpoot still two metres away from delivering. Length ball on middle stump, he has taken a tiny step into the leg side and whipped this well over the midwicket boundary"
1.6,"Tye to Patel, 2 runs",short of a length just outside off. Chopped to backward point who parries it to his right after tumbling. They sneak a single because of it and then they take an overthrow as mid-on tries to get to the throw backing up
1.5,"Tye to Patel, FOUR runs","glorious. Shot of the evening. The perfect cover drive. Length ball just outside off and Parthiv is quickly onto the front foot, leaning in to drill this between cover and extra cover"
1.4,"Tye to Patel, FOUR runs",whipped. So easy. Overpitched on the leg stump and he gets it wide of short fine
1.3,"Tye to Kohli, 1 run","close call! Length ball at middle stump, flicked straight to mid-on. It's timed well and Kohli has misjudged this one. Ashwin is onto it quickly to his right and fires a throw at the non-striker's end. Kohli would have been short"
1.2,"Tye to Kohli, no run","stays in the crease this time and punches nicely to find point. Short of a length in the corridor this time, no movement"
1.1,"Tye to Kohli, no run",leading edge. Kohli walks down the track to try and flick a length ball that's swinging away in the corridor
0.6,"Ashwin to Patel, FOUR runs",oh well played. Goes deep in the crease as this skids into him. Stand tall though and keeps his head still to punch it wide of mid-on off the back foot
0.5,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run",length ball pushed into the pads. Flicked to square leg's left
0.4,"Ashwin to Patel, 1 run","length ball at off stump, stays in the crease and punches to mid-off with the turn"
0.3,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","length on off stump, flicked to long-on off the front foot"
0.2,"Ashwin to Patel, 1 run",pushes a slider in at a good length on middle stump. Parthiv makes room and pushes to mid-off
0.1,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run",length ball pushed into the pads and he whips to deep square off the back foot
15.1,"Ali to Axar Patel, 1 run, OUT","back of a length outside off, punched between wide long-on and deep midwicket. They try to push back for the second and has there been another run out? Yes. The bat's in the air as the zingers light up. Axar pays the price for failing to drag the bat across. Simply hangs it loose in the air and then tries to plant it down. But it's too late and he has to continue running in that direction towards the change rooms"
14.6,"Siraj to Rajpoot, no run","length on off, stands tall and punches into the covers with bat and pad close together. An aesthetically pleasing shot, but quite useless in the situation"
14.5,"Siraj to Axar Patel, 1 run","short, angled across off, Axar drags a pull to long-on"
14.5,"Siraj to Axar Patel, 1 wide","bowled down the leg side, Axar swings and misses"
14.4,"Siraj to Rajpoot, 1 run","length around off, punches towards mid-on and takes on the fielder for another quick run. No direct throw this time"
14.3,"Siraj to Rajpoot, no run",swings and misses at a fuller ball
14.2,"Siraj to Rajpoot, no run",tries to pull a short one and misses as it gets big on him
14.1,"Siraj to Rajpoot, no run",punches a length ball into the covers
13.6,"Ali to Sharma, OUT","length ball that keeps a little low around off, worked away to mid-on where there's a misfield and they decide to try and capitalise on it by stealing a second. Not a bad plan, except that they don't account for the fielder recovering in time and firing a dead accurate throw that grazes Moeen's hand and takes out the stumps. Mohit is just short of his ground. Oh, and the fielder was AB de Villiers!"
13.5,"Ali to Sharma, no run","pitched up outside off, drills this uppishy towards mid-off"
13.4,"Ali to Axar Patel, 1 run","straight on middle, flicked to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Ali to Sharma, 1 run","back of a length, spins in, tucked to square leg"
13.2,"Ali to Axar Patel, 1 run","fullish outside off, punched down to long-off"
13.1,"Ali to Sharma, 1 run",flicked uppishly through square leg
12.6,"Yadav to Axar Patel, no run","full, angled across off, Axar leans forward into a drive to the covers"
12.5,"Yadav to Sharma, 1 run","back of a length around off, drops it into covers for one"
12.4,"Yadav to Tye, OUT","has he nicked off here? Yes, sounded like a feather. Tye tries to pull this shortish one that gets a little too big on him outside off and gets a mild top-edge that goes through to the keeper. Seems like he wanted to review that. At least that was the signal to the umpire but he ends up walking right past him"
12.3,"Yadav to Tye, no run","ripper that nearly shaves the outside edge. Short of a length, opening him up as it jags away ever-so-slightly off the deck"
12.2,"Yadav to Tye, no run","fuller around leg, pushed down the pitch"
12.1,"Yadav to Axar Patel, 1 run","back of a length, tucked to square leg"
11.6,"Ali to Ashwin, OUT","has Ashwin run himself out here? He's put in a dive that may have just saved him, No, in fact, it hasn't. That's pretty incredible. A wide, bad throw but Ashwin is nowhere in the frame as Parthiv breaks the stumps. The Kings XI captain dropped this length ball into the covers and just set off for the single but was sent back by an uninterested Axar. Kings XI in quite the mess here"
11.5,"Ali to Finch, OUT","and he's picked out deep midwicket. Kings XI falling apart here. Finch picks up this length ball from middle and off and fails to get hold of this slog, skews it straight into the hands of Kohli in the deep"
11.4,"Ali to Axar Patel, 1 run","short of a length around off, Axar punches off the backfoot to long-off"
11.3,"Ali to Finch, 1 run","back of a length, flat trajectories, shovelled flat on the bounce to deep square leg"
11.2,"Ali to Finch, no run","slides on outside off, Finch backs away and chops it to the right of cover"
11.1,"Ali to Finch, SIX runs",backs away and Moeen follows him with a shortish delivery. The angle only helps Finch as he swivels and mows a pull over deep midwicket
10.6,"Grandhomme to Axar Patel, no run","short of a length, angled across on off, Axar shuffles across and blocks down the pitch"
10.5,"Grandhomme to Finch, 1 run","full and angled in, flicked to deep midwicket"
10.4,"Grandhomme to Finch, no run","just back of a length, tries to glance it fine but the ball grazes the pad on its way to Parthiv behind the stumps"
10.3,"Grandhomme to Axar Patel, 1 run","back of a length outside off, flat-batted to sweeper cover"
10.2,"Grandhomme to Finch, 1 run","short of a length, cuts away late slightly, waits before tapping it through point for one"
10.2,"Grandhomme to Finch, 1 wide",sprays it down the leg side
10.1,"Grandhomme to Axar Patel, 1 run","back of a length around off, punched down the ground to the left of mid-off"
9.6,"Chahal to Axar Patel, 1 run","floats it up a little on leg, clipped off the pads to deep backward square leg"
9.5,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run","back of a length, backs away and punches it out to sweeper cover"
9.4,"Chahal to Finch, no run","length on middle and off, blocked off the front foot"
9.3,"Chahal to Axar Patel, 1 leg bye","drifts it onto the pads, tries to flick it away but gets hit on the pad. Pitching outside leg"
9.2,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run","full and sliding into the pads, clipped away through square leg"
9.1,"Chahal to Finch, no run","back of a length, straightening around off, backs away and cuts to point"
8.6,"Grandhomme to Axar Patel, no run","back of a length, tucked into the leg side"
8.5,"Grandhomme to Agarwal, OUT",is there a touch on that? Sounded like it! Parthiv thinks it's out too as he goes down leg side to complete a take. Mayank looking to flick this. The umpire goes to the leg umpire so he thinks there's a touch on this. Asks for the third umpire with a soft signal out. This doesn't look good for Mayank. Full ball down leg side and the bat is enough of a distance away to prove there's no pads involved. Parthiv has taken it cleanly too.
8.4,"Grandhomme to Agarwal, no run","short of a length outside off, front-foot pull straight to short midwicket"
8.3,"Grandhomme to Finch, 1 run","length ball angled in at leg stump. Looks to dab it through midwicket and only manages to chip it into that region, closes the face too early"
8.3,"Grandhomme to Finch, 1 wide",length ball slanted down leg side. He can't get bat on that
8.2,"Grandhomme to Agarwal, 1 run","length and in at middle stump, clipped to deep square from the crease"
8.1,"Grandhomme to Agarwal, no run","offcutter, short and very wide. He doesn't move his feet and can't get the middle of the bat with the cut as a result. Gets it straight to extra cover"
7.6,"Siraj to Finch, SIX runs",oh what a shot! Finch has generated an unbelievable amount of power for a straight-batted shot to clear the extra cover boundary. Very full and just outside off and this is so smooth - a clean lift to clear the ground
7.5,"Siraj to Finch, no run","full on off stump, driven straight to mid-off"
7.4,"Siraj to Agarwal, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, gets inside the line and slices to third man"
7.3,"Siraj to Finch, 1 run","full and just outside off. Front foot plant, sweetly timed drive to sweeper cover"
7.2,"Siraj to Finch, no run","short of a length just outside off, gets on his toes and taps it to point"
7.1,"Siraj to Finch, no run",beaten. Length ball skidding through outside off and is too much for the attempted drive on the up
6.6,"Chahal to Agarwal, no run","tossed up at off stump again, driven back on the bounce to the bowler"
6.5,"Chahal to Stoinis, OUT",bowled him! Good old spinner's wicket - keep the single option open to a nervous batsman and bowl at his stumps. Stoinis looks like he wants to push it through covers but has pushed his front foot too far forward in anticipation. Yorks himself and loses his off stump
6.4,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run",dropped very short outside off but he can only get the pull straight to long-on
6.3,"Chahal to Finch, no run","short of a length slider at off stump, backs away and gets the punch straight to extra cover"
6.2,"Chahal to Stoinis, 1 run",floated up at off stump and he gets down quickly for the reverse sweep. Siraj cleans up to his left at short third man
6.1,"Chahal to Finch, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut straight to deep point"
5.6,"Siraj to Finch, 1 run",length and in at off stump. Jabbed into the off side from the crease
5.5,"Siraj to Finch, FOUR runs",oh lovely. Leans in as he caresses this through the covers. Length ball just outside off and the weight transfer through this is what gets him the runs
5.4,"Siraj to Finch, no run",just keeps it out. Length ball speared in at off stump. No forward press as he defends this
5.3,"Siraj to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, opens the face and chops it to third man's right"
5.2,"Siraj to Nair, OUT","he's guided it straight to slip! Oh this is turning bad very fast for Punjab. Short of a length ball outside off and he's looking for the single to third man. It's not done too much - no crazy movement, no extra bounce. It's just a supremely placed shot to Kohli at second-ish slip"
5.1,"Siraj to Nair, no run","full and in at off stump, tapped straight to mid-off"
4.6,"Yadav to Gayle, OUT","at deep square again! Umesh's extended spell has yielded both openers. Short ball at off stump, he gets too far under it for the hook and it sails high. Siraj is calm under it and takes with the reverse cup. Umesh has done everything that was asked of him by his captain. Superb spell"
4.5,"Yadav to Gayle, FOUR runs",two-handed forehand wide of mid-off. That is creamed. Short of a length and the first semblance of room Umesh has offered. Gayle backs away and slaps away
4.4,"Yadav to Nair, 1 run","short of a length outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
4.3,"Yadav to Rahul, OUT","taken at deep square! Another short ball that looks to be on its way, but Colin de Grandhomme is stationed at deep square to snap this high to his right. He's five yards in from the boundary for some reason - strange on this small ground. But he's done the job. A huge wicket. Not the greatest ball - short and heading into the body"
4.2,"Yadav to Rahul, SIX runs","see ya! Umesh tries to become the wristspinning Yadav and fails woefully. A half-tacker, sits up nicely at off stump Rahul slogs it over midwicket"
4.1,"Yadav to Rahul, 2 runs","deft from Rahul. Length ball at middle stump, gets right on top of the bounce and tickles it through the open square leg region"
3.6,"Southee to Gayle, FOUR runs","full toss this time and Punjab have a sensational over. Gayle has his front foot out of the way as he's backing into the off side. Gets behind the line, chips it over mid-off"
3.5,"Southee to Gayle, FOUR runs",too short. Southee can't get that to climb at Gayle's chest and that means plenty of room for the batsman to swivel and swat this on the bounce to the midwicket boundary
3.4,"Southee to Rahul, 1 leg bye","short of a length on the pads. Looks to play the glance, gets it into the square leg region"
3.3,"Southee to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length on the pads, whipped away to deep square off the back foot"
3.2,"Southee to Gayle, no run",yorker at off stump. Deep in the crease as he punches it back at the bowler who stops it with his left boot
3.1,"Southee to Gayle, FOUR runs","hammered. Poor ball. Short, very wide. Gayle pummels it well in front of cover"
2.6,"Yadav to Rahul, no run",falls short of AB at mid-off. Rahul backs away to open up the off side. They haven't given him any room today. He's off balance as he tries to punch on the up while moving down leg side. Chips it and AB puts in a full length dive to his right and forward. Won't get there
2.5,"Yadav to Rahul, SIX runs","shot! Cannot bowl short to Rahul this season! His game behind the wicket has improved dramatically. It's at his head, but slightly down leg side. He has no issues getting slightly inside the line and hooking over fine leg"
2.4,"Yadav to Gayle, 1 run","guides the yorker down to third man. Almost expects this ball from fast bowlers, Gayle. Stands tall in the crease and digs it out"
2.3,"Yadav to Gayle, no run",cramped but he gets bat on this. Short of a length ball climbing up at his ribs as he looks to cut
2.2,"Yadav to Gayle, no run",struck on the thigh and looking for a quick single! Yadav has Gayle rattled. Short of a length and into his body. He's very very late on the attempted pull and there's no run at short leg
2.1,"Yadav to Gayle, no run",beats the outside edge as Gayle is stranded. No feet as he hangs the bat out in the corridor. It fizzes past him
1.6,"Southee to Rahul, SIX runs","swiped away. Southee goes marginally short and with his stump-to-stump line, Rahul has the freedom to go behind square. He's got the ability to get on the back foot quickly too. Sends it over square leg"
1.5,"Southee to Rahul, no run","length ball slanted in at the stumps. Once again, can't do more than defend down the pitch"
1.4,"Southee to Rahul, no run",Rahul walks into the leg side to expose the stumps. Southee follows him with a length ball and forces him to defend
1.3,"Southee to Rahul, no run","length ball at off stump, gets right behind it to defend into the covers"
1.2,"Southee to Rahul, no run","good length, some shape away in the corridor. Goes deep in the crease and defends down the pitch with soft hands"
1.1,"Southee to Rahul, no run","length ball just outside, defended watchfully on the front foot"
0.6,"Yadav to Gayle, no run",ouch. Gayle doesn't know about this one either. A bouncer slanted across his stumps that he's expecting to nip away. Expect it thuds him under the left shoulder
0.5,"Yadav to Gayle, no run","dropped! Parthiv Patel can't hold on with a one-handed dive to his left. Gayle and he are both expecting this to swing in. It does through the air before straightening. Gayle defends inside the line to get the edge, Parthiv takes a step to his right before leaping one-handed. Can't take it"
0.4,"Yadav to Gayle, no run",full and swinging in fast at middle stump. Gets the bat down in time to keep this out
0.3,"Yadav to Rahul, 1 run",late swing again. Length ball hooping away and Rahul stabs at it away from the body to run is uppishly towards third man
0.2,"Yadav to Rahul, no run","good length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
0.1,"Yadav to Rahul, no run",swing. Late away swing in the corridor. Rahul on the front foot and jabbing at this with soft hands. Gets it into his body off the inside edge
17.6,"Pandya to Buttler, SIX runs","finished in style! Stunning feat of beast-mode batting, clobbered violently into the midwicket stands, and the Royals have stolen a critical march on Mumbai in the battle for the play-offs "
17.5,"Pandya to Samson, OUT","an inside-out slap over the off side, but he hasn't got enough on this, and holes out to deep point! Comfortably snaffled by the sub Chahar"
17.4,"Pandya to Samson, no run","through to the keeper this time, but it's a dot ball too late"
17.3,"Pandya to Samson, SIX runs","Samson has no interest in landmarks, he just wants a quick finish! Powered over cow corner, and this one is utterly cooked!"
17.2,"Pandya to Samson, SIX runs","slower ball, too short, and Samson responds with arguably the most massive spank of the night! High and mighty into the floodlights and 20 rows back!"
17.1,"Pandya to Samson, no run","fully forward, driven into the covers"
16.6,"McClenaghan to Buttler, FOUR runs","panned over long on! The beast is tearing up the Wankhede! One bounce, inches inside the rope, and he's 12 away from his hundred with 16 runs to play with "
16.5,"McClenaghan to Buttler, no run","slower ball, aiming for the tramlines, and that's worked out in the end. Buttler left it alone, but was adjudged to have shuffled close enough to have a swing"
16.5,"McClenaghan to Samson, 2 wide","short, too short! The keeper does exceptionally to take off like a jump-jet and get a glove on that to slow its path to the boundary"
16.4,"McClenaghan to Buttler, 1 run","pounded down to long-off, clearing the front leg and connecting with power and intent once more"
16.3,"McClenaghan to Samson, 1 run","outside off again, back of a length and pace off the ball, inside-edged into the pads and they steal the single"
16.2,"McClenaghan to Samson, no run","very full length from round the wicket, driven with an open face and gathered in the gully. An almost Test-match flash of play there. It won't last"
16.1,"McClenaghan to Buttler, 1 run","width outside off, attempted slap into the covers but no proper connection"
15.6,"Markande to Buttler, 1 run","eased down to long-on, calm as you like"
15.5,"Markande to Samson, 1 run",pushed out to wide long-on. Some Mumbai fans have seen enough and are heading into the lights of Marine Drive
15.4,"Markande to Samson, FOUR runs",pumped clean down the ground. Top striking!
15.3,"Markande to Buttler, 1 run",
15.2,"Markande to Samson, 1 run","tossed up into the toes, tapped to the leg side"
15.1,"Markande to Samson, FOUR runs","sliding down the leg side, and paddled calmly down through fine leg. Cute and effective"
14.6,"Bumrah to Samson, 1 run","tucked into the leg side, to keep the strike. The Royals are ticking along nicely"
14.5,"Bumrah to Buttler, 1 run",pushed into the off side
14.4,"Bumrah to Buttler, SIX runs","banjaxed into the stands! Where do you bowl to this man? A more aggressive short ball this time, but it just brings out a more aggressive swing of the blade, over square leg!"
14.3,"Bumrah to Buttler, FOUR runs","too short for a man seeing it this well. Buttler stands firm, such a solid base, and baseball swings over the leg side"
14.2,"Bumrah to Samson, 1 run",guided down to third man
14.1,"Bumrah to Buttler, 1 run",sliding back into the crease to guide a length ball into the covers
13.6,"Pandya to Buttler, 1 run",pushed out to deep cover to keep the strike
13.5,"Pandya to Buttler, 2 runs","spanked with more power down to long-on, and this time it's intercepted"
13.4,"Pandya to Buttler, FOUR runs","flat, hard, frightening power! Get in the way of that if you dare. Long-on can't, he doesn't have time!"
13.3,"Pandya to Buttler, SIX runs","absolutely slaughtered into the stands! He's having a lot of fun out there now, head right over the ball, even at the point of contact, and slammed with Popeye forearms over cow corner!"
13.2,"Pandya to Samson, 1 run",flicked down to fine leg to get off the mark
13.1,"Pandya to Rahane, OUT","in the slot, spanked high and hard, there's a fielder lurking at deep mid-off, and he just about clings on! Yadav over-ran that shot at first, and almost slid back into a position to catch it in his midriff. Ungainly, but timely!"
12.6,"McClenaghan to Buttler, no run","slower-ball bouncer, Buttler has the big wind-up but he can't make any contact. There've been some moments in this innings where Buttler's been out-smarted, but he finds a way to hit back every time"
12.5,"McClenaghan to Buttler, no run","inverts his stance, for the third time this innings. And for the third time, he makes no contact. That one's not working today Jos"
12.4,"McClenaghan to Buttler, FOUR runs","mown through the covers like a combine-harvester across the outfield! Such fast hands, giving him time to angle the ball through the field"
12.3,"McClenaghan to Rahane, 1 run","a round-house pull, out to midwicket. Not perfectly timed but gets enough bat through the ball to steal the single"
12.2,"McClenaghan to Rahane, no run","through to the keeper once more, good pace and line"
12.1,"McClenaghan to Rahane, no run","fizzing through to the keeper, the left-arm line taking the ball clear of an ambitious wallop"
11.6,"Pandya to Buttler, FOUR runs","that's just power and placement! Pounded through the covers, to bring up the five in a row! Not a lot wrong with the ball, but the shot was poetry"
11.5,"Pandya to Buttler, 2 runs","flicked to the leg side, they scuttle the first in a jiffy, and turn sharply for the second. Excellent pressure"
11.4,"Pandya to Rahane, 1 run",worked into the covers to hand over the strike
11.3,"Pandya to Rahane, FOUR runs","slapped in the air, and just wide of short third man! Bumrah is the man, can't quite get his feet moving quickly enough to intercept a rare chance"
11.2,"Pandya to Buttler, 1 run","width this time, and cracked hard out to point"
11.1,"Pandya to Rahane, 1 run",pounded down to long-on with a fierce swing through the line. A good shot for just a single
10.6,"Krunal to Buttler, no run","no contact this time, as this one zips through Buttler's swing and into his thigh-pad"
10.5,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run",eased down to long on
10.4,"Krunal to Rahane, no run","down on one knee, an ambitious sweep and a huge appeal! They are tempted to have a look, and yep, here we go, it's a review! It's Buttler, so it's worth the gamble, though it did look optimistic. Going to have to be smashing leg to be overturned  nope, it's missing leg!"
10.3,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run",pushed to the off side
10.2,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","flicked in the air, but one bounce, down to the sweeper at backward square"
10.1,"Krunal to Rahane, no run","worked to the leg side, on the back foot"
9.6,"Markande to Buttler, SIX runs","here we go! Tossed up, right into Buttler's slot, and he slots it with glee, high over the leg side!"
9.5,"Markande to Buttler, 2 runs",flicked along the ground out to deep midwicket
9.4,"Markande to Rahane, 1 run","swept hard down to backward square, but gathered by the sweeper"
9.3,"Markande to Buttler, 1 run",another unflustered nudge into the gap on the leg side
9.2,"Markande to Buttler, 2 runs","clipped out through midwicket, well placed into the gap"
9.1,"Markande to Buttler, no run","very full length, clears the front leg to ease the ball back to the bowler"
8.6,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run",punched down the ground for another single
8.5,"Krunal to Buttler, no run","stunning ball! Tossed up, dips late, spins and bounces, and whistles through his pushed drive and over the top of middle! Takes a good ball to get past Buttler at the moment"
8.4,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run",fenced into the covers for another single
8.3,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run","attempted back-cut, can't get it off the square but they scamper the single, Krunal has been effective tonight"
8.2,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run",back of a length and pushed to long-on
8.1,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run",tossed up and driven to long off
7.6,"Markande to Buttler, 1 run","makes room, slaps through the line, straight back at the bowler, who half-stops in his followthrough as they jog the single"
7.5,"Markande to Rahane, 1 run","on the pads, no room to free the arms, and Rahane settles for a measured nudge to square leg"
7.4,"Markande to Buttler, 1 run",flicked off the legs to fine leg
7.3,"Markande to Buttler, no run",shuffling feet and pushed into the covers
7.2,"Markande to Buttler, FOUR runs","marching down to meet the pitch, and deposited back over the bowler's head! Such poise, power and timing"
7.1,"Markande to Rahane, 1 run",bottom-handed punch down to long on
6.6,"Bumrah to Buttler, FOUR runs","whoops, that's ruined the effect! An attempted slower ball, but it comes out as a horrid hip-high wide full-toss. Contemptuously blatted through long-off"
6.5,"Bumrah to Rahane, 1 run","opens the face to glide down to third man, a good release shot but nothing wrong with the ball. Tight stuff"
6.4,"Bumrah to Rahane, no run","on the back foot, dragging the length back, and worked back to the bowler. This is a very good over so far"
6.3,"Bumrah to Rahane, no run","crunched into the covers, on the front foot"
6.2,"Bumrah to Buttler, 1 run",nudged into the leg side
6.1,"Bumrah to Rahane, 1 run","just back of a good length, angling into the right-hander, tucked off the legs"
5.6,"Pandya to Buttler, no run","that's a good response from Pandya, shorter and sharper, tempting Buttler into the ramp shot, but the ball is through him too quickly. Cat-and-mouse stuff in that over"
5.5,"Pandya to Buttler, no run","another attempted scoop, another non-connection. Nothing ventured, nothing gained "
5.4,"Pandya to Buttler, FOUR runs","blam! So much bottom hand! Over-pitched, in the arc, and utterly butchered for a one-bounce four through long-off"
5.3,"Pandya to Buttler, no run","Buttler inverts his stance for his trademark scoop shot, the length was safe enough, but no contact as the ball hops over his stumps"
5.2,"Pandya to Rahane, 1 run","more wristy flipping, from a good length on off stump out through backward square."
5.1,"Pandya to Rahane, 2 runs",another intentful glide into the covers
4.6,"Krunal to Buttler, no run","pumped into the covers, more intent for no runs this time, but they are starting to flow now"
4.5,"Krunal to Buttler, no run","crunched to extra cover, they decline to take the single for the slight misfield"
4.4,"Krunal to Buttler, SIX runs","down on one knee, and away she goes! High over backward square, just high enough to lob over the flaying fielder"
4.3,"Krunal to Buttler, FOUR runs","makes room early, Krunal follows him, Buttler retreats some more, lofts inside out over cover, and away for four! Skill and power"
4.2,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","nurdled out to deep midwicket, no need to rush for the Royals"
4.1,"Krunal to Rahane, no run","swept once more, out to backward square"
3.6,"McClenaghan to Buttler, no run","pounded with massive intent, front foot cleared to the leg side, but Cutting gathers in the long barrier at mid-off"
3.5,"McClenaghan to Rahane, 1 run",punched on the up to mid-off
3.4,"McClenaghan to Rahane, FOUR runs","dinky wristwork! Played it so late it was almost into next week, and when you've got angles like those in your locker, who needs extreme power?"
3.3,"McClenaghan to Rahane, no run","short and sharp, and though it's down the leg side, it's tight enough to the body to get away with it. More aggression in that delivery"
3.3,"McClenaghan to Rahane, 1 wide",sliding down the leg side
3.2,"McClenaghan to Rahane, no run","attempted ramp from Rahane, but he wears it on the glove. Leaning back, attempting to pinch a four through third man, but the slower ball did for him"
3.1,"McClenaghan to Rahane, FOUR runs","whipped off the pads, that's a superb connection, timed through the 45, and away to the rope"
2.6,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run",flicked into the leg side for another single
2.5,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run",tucked out to midwicket once more
2.4,"Krunal to Buttler, no run","swept hard to square leg and has that carried to Markande? No it hasn't   a flurry of excitement, but Buttler was unbothered. Good connection, if a touch early. Nope, just short"
2.3,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length, tapped to point and a jogged single ensues"
2.2,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run",clipped with the spin out to midwicket
2.1,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","looped up from round the wicket, into the toes, and tucked to the leg side"
1.6,"McClenaghan to Rahane, 1 leg bye","back of a length, into the body, flinched to the leg side, that's a better over for Mumbai"
1.5,"McClenaghan to Rahane, no run","a change of pace from Mitch, clipped off the pads but well stopped at short midwicket"
1.4,"McClenaghan to Buttler, 1 run","chiselled off the pads, out to deep midwicket"
1.4,"McClenaghan to Buttler, 1 wide","fizzing through to the keeper, short, sharp, aggressive   and wide"
1.3,"McClenaghan to Rahane, 1 run","that's a good length for these conditions, just back of full, skidding into the body, and duly defended to the leg side"
1.2,"McClenaghan to Buttler, 1 run",flipped off the legs to backward square leg
1.1,"McClenaghan to Buttler, no run","on the back foot, left-arm over the wicket, Buttler slides back to meet the ball under his nose, deep in his crease"
0.6,"Bumrah to Rahane, FOUR runs","that's the way to do it! Good positive footwork, stretching to meet the half-volley and slice-driving it through the covers"
0.5,"Bumrah to Short, OUT","edged and gone! And that had been coming all over! A bit of swing, Bumrah gets his line right, Short's feet going nowhere, and the keeper snaffles a comfortable nick!"
0.4,"Bumrah to Short, no run","a good zippy length, sliding into the bat, on the back foot once more"
0.3,"Bumrah to Short, no run","on the back foot, dragging the length back well this time"
0.2,"Bumrah to Short, no run","Short is creasebound, and pokes awkwardly as the ball zips through from back of a length"
0.2,"Bumrah to Short, 5 wide","not such a good ball  a horrid leg-side wide  sublime to ridiculous, much like the earlier catching "
0.1,"Bumrah to Short, FOUR runs","Zoinks, that is a staggeringly good first ball, a massive booming inswinger, Short jabs down late and somehow digs it out through fine leg for four!"
19.6,"Stokes to Cutting, 2 runs","slower short ball outside off, Cutting can't manufacture his own pace. Dragged away to wide long-on. Cutting hares back for the second"
19.5,"Stokes to Pandya, OUT","Samson pulls off a blinder. He is a wicketkeeper but he tears across to his right in the outfield and plucks a diving catch at deep midwicket. He tumbles onto the ground but still holds his balance and hangs onto the ball. Full and drifting into the pads, Samson picks it up and shovels a catch. That it was a catch was down to Samson's brilliance"
19.4,"Stokes to Pandya, no run","107.8ks slower ball outside off, Hardik goes for an encore. Hardik fails. He can't touch the ball"
19.3,"Stokes to Pandya, FOUR runs","The man behind the stumps is a master of this shot. The man in front shows off he can do it too. Hardik jumps across off, meets a slower length ball and flips it away past the left of the diving Buttler"
19.2,"Stokes to Cutting, 1 leg bye","seam-up, short and angling into the body, beats the batsman for pace, hits the thigh and rolls away to short third man"
19.1,"Stokes to Cutting, SIX runs","Cutting tees off in the final over. Slower ball, 100ks, but too full on middle, Cutting clears his front leg and smites it over the long-on fence. Muscled away. Royals continue to err in lengths"
18.6,"Unadkat to Pandya, no run","seam-up, bouncer, fizzes through outside off, beats the batsman's lousy attempt to uppercut it away"
18.5,"Unadkat to Cutting, 1 run","Archer now drops an absolute sitter. Look at Warne in the dugout: he has his hands on his mouth. Slower offcutter outside off, Cutting is way too early into his slog-sweep and toe-ends it into the sky. It drops down and Archer drops it at backward point"
18.4,"Unadkat to Pandya, 1 run","lifter outside off from around the stumps, gets big on Hardik, who lines up for a hook. Top-edges over midwicket, does not carry to the man in the deep"
18.3,"Unadkat to Pandya, SIX runs","seam-up, the yorker isn't coming out right for Unadkat. Low full-toss outside off, Hardik rocks forward, lets his hands flow through the line. Smeared up and over extra cover for another six. Last four balls 17 runs"
18.3,"Unadkat to Pandya, 1 wide","the pressure gets to Unadkat. Full and spared wide outside off, past the marker"
18.2,"Unadkat to Pandya, FOUR runs","Unadkat goes for the wide yorker, it comes out as a low full-toss outside off, not quite the MS Dhoni slice over backward point, but still effective. Back-to-back boundaries for Hardik"
18.1,"Unadkat to Pandya, SIX runs","timely boundary for Mumbai. This a monster six. Length ball on middle, Hardik stretches out, shows off his high elbow and smokes it straight down the ground. Into the second tier. Bam!"
17.6,"Archer to Cutting, no run","147ks - pace like fire - bouncer, aimed at the head, rocks his head out of the way. What a way to finish your spell. Well done, Archer"

17.1,"Archer to Pandya, 1 wide","Hardik shuffles across off and throws Archer off his line. Sprayed down leg, leg-side wide"
16.6,"Unadkat to Pandya, 1 run","short on middle, shimmies out and whips to deep midwicket"
16.5,"Unadkat to Krunal, OUT","Gowtham nearly drops it. He hangs onto the catch on the rebound. After playing out two dots, Krunal goes for an almighty leg-side swing. He doesn't have the pace to work with. This is the offcutter from Unadkat, bounces from a length outside off, Krunal wants to drag it from there. But he can only skew a catch to long-on, where Gowtham nearly made a mess of it"
16.4,"Unadkat to Krunal, no run","another short ball, wide outside off, away from the reach of Krunal's hook. Beaten in the end"

16.2,"Unadkat to Pandya, 1 run","wide of the crease, slanting in at off stump, Hardik opens the face, tips the ball to short third man and hares across. The fielder (Kulkarni) misses a direct hit at the striker's end"
16.1,"Unadkat to Pandya, 2 runs","Unadkat goes short and wide outside off, seam-up, as Hardik ventures down the track and cracks the ball away to Samson at sweeper cover"

14.3,"Stokes to Pandya, no run","back of a length on off, opens the face to point. Hardik wants an ambitious single but is sent back by Krunal"
14.2,"Stokes to Ishan, OUT","shortish, it's slower at 113.1kmph, and that gets in the way of Kishan's timing. Skews it off a bit ofa top-edge and Samson judges a catch to perfection at deep midwicket. Moves slightly back and grabs it reverse-cupped with the floodlights in his line of vision"
14.1,"Stokes to Ishan, no run","short of a length around off, punched to short cover"
13.6,"Kulkarni to Pandya, FOUR runs","short outside off, Hardik doesn't even arch back as much as he ramps it through the third man region"

13.4,"Kulkarni to Ishan, FOUR runs","just short of a length, not the most well-timed of pulls but enough to carry to the deep midwicket boundary"
13.3,"Kulkarni to Ishan, 2 runs","length ball on off, blocked to short cover. Rahane there sees Hardik backing up and fires a throw that hits the stumps. And they take extra runs off the deflection"
13.2,"Kulkarni to Lewis, OUT","good length, a bit of width, Lewis opens up and slaps but slices it in the air and Sanju Samson moves to his right and snaffles it at deep point"

10.5,"Archer to Rohit Sharma, OUT","and now Unadkat grabs a chest-height catch. Rohit is out first ball, and Mumbai are losing some ground. Rohit flays a pull to this short ball but it goes straight to long leg. That was travelling and Unadkat reverse-cups and falls over as he completes the catch. That's a brilliant piece of fielding"
10.4,"Archer to Yadav, OUT",tries to pull this short one but skews it in the air off the top part of the bat. Unadkat at long leg moves forward and takes a superb low catch. Around shin height
10.3,"Archer to Lewis, 1 leg bye","back of a length, misses the flick behind square as the ball goes off the hip"
10.2,"Archer to Lewis, no run","short outside off, Lewis punches to mid-off off the bottom of the bat. He's struggling through these middle overs here. Need to find some fluency"
10.1,"Archer to Lewis, no run","short of a length outside off, gets on top of it and opens the face to backward point who dives and prevents the single"

9.1,"Unadkat to Lewis, no run","back of a length, complete lack of pace messes up Lewis' timing as he feels for it and misses"

8.5,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length, spinning away, punched down to long-on"
8.4,"Gopal to Lewis, 1 run","non-turning length ball on a leg-stump line, whipped off the pads through square leg"
8.3,"Gopal to Lewis, 2 runs","extremely full outside off, squeezed out through the off side"
8.2,"Gopal to Lewis, SIX runs",now that's a more believable six. Down the ground and mowed straight over long-off with plenty of elevation
8.1,"Gopal to Lewis, SIX runs","legside fuller ball, Lewis gets down for a sweep and he's timed it alright, but it's ridiculous how that's carried over the backward square leg fence. A flat six"

7.5,"Unadkat to Yadav, 1 run","slower full ball on off, 123.2 kmph, driven down to long-on"

6.4,"Gopal to Yadav, no run","length ball, spins away slightly towards off, pushed back to the bowler"
6.3,"Gopal to Yadav, no run","full and straight on middle, blocked off the front foot into the covers"
6.2,"Gopal to Lewis, 1 run","googly, on a length, shuffles and works against the turn to midwicket"
6.1,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","flat length ball, flicks to the left of midwicket"
5.6,"Kulkarni to Lewis, FOUR runs",ruins a good over with a useless full toss. Seems like that slipped out of the hand and Lewis shovels it over the in-field on the off side
5.5,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","yorker on middle, this is good, tight bowling, drilled away to the left of mid-off where Stokes hurries across and cuts it off"
5.4,"Kulkarni to Lewis, 1 run","dipping fuller one outside off, reaches out and squeezes it out to short third man for a quick one"
5.3,"Kulkarni to Lewis, FOUR runs",picks the slower ball really early and waits before opening the face and running it through backward point. Knew his field to perfection
5.2,"Kulkarni to Lewis, no run",too full and sneaks from underneath the bat as he reaches out for it
5.1,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length around off, shuffles across and punches down to long-on"
4.6,"Stokes to Lewis, no run","high full toss, backs away and fends it away awkwardly to cover. Just about gets away with a no-ball"

4.2,"Stokes to Lewis, no run","short of a length around off, backs away and slashes it out to gully"
4.1,"Stokes to Lewis, FOUR runs",starts off with a short delivery with loads of width and Lewis throws his hands at it and gets an outside edge through third man
3.6,"Kulkarni to Yadav, FOUR runs","almost knocks over the non-striker. A slower full ball, gets a bit of a leading edge as he closes the face and chips it in the air. Lewis just about gets under it as the ball races down the ground for four"
3.5,"Kulkarni to Yadav, no run","full on middle and leg, pushed down the ground to mid-on"
3.4,"Kulkarni to Yadav, FOUR runs","short of good length, jumps inside the crease to get on top of it and uses the angle to tuck it through midwicket. Good timing on that one"

2.4,"Archer to Lewis, 3 runs","in the air, stays there for like forever, and Binny can't get his hands to it at mid-on. He got in position nicely, mind you, but that took so long to come down Binny might as well have taken a power nap.  Goes reverse-cupped and the ball just about grazes the fingers before landing on the ground. Lewis gets lots of elevation but hardly much distance on this loft down the ground"
2.3,"Archer to Lewis, no run","short, angled into him, hits the elbow as he tries to fend it away"
2.3,"Archer to Lewis, 1 wide",drifts a back of a length delivery down the legside
2.2,"Archer to Lewis, no run","back of a length, tries to flick and does so early. It's the slower one and he gets hit on the back arm"
2.1,"Archer to Lewis, no run","short and holding its line outside off, arches back and lets it go"
1.6,"Kulkarni to Lewis, 1 run",works away a fuller one off the inside of the bat to deep backward square leg
1.5,"Kulkarni to Lewis, no run",in the air again and once more falling short. Not as close as the previous one though. The bat turns in Lewis' hands as he tries to drill this fuller one away

1.2,"Kulkarni to Yadav, FOUR runs","short and wide, stands tall and cracks it through the covers"

0.1,"Gowtham to Yadav, no run","pitched up outside off, driven hard to point who gets down to his left and half-stops it"
18.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni, 1 run","turns this gently into the leg side, that's that. CSK cruise home in style with an over to spare.  They're all but into the playoffs. "
18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, 1 run","walks across the stumps and works this length ball to square leg.  That's Rayudu's century, what a knock!

I've only seen him angry"
18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni, 1 run",squeezed down to third man to bring Rayudu on strike
18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni, FOUR runs",slams this pull to deep square leg. Neither deep midwicket nor fine leg moved. Ferocious strike

18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, no run","banged in short, Rayudu leaves. Umpire signals one bouncer for the over. He shaped to pull but decided to let go late"
17.6,"Kaul to Dhoni, SIX runs","Sid Kaul keeps bowling full tosses, keeps getting whacked! Hasn't learnt, bowls a full toss on middle, Dhoni sends this deep into the deep square leg boundary. That was the  fourth full toss in a row "

15.5,"Shakib to Rayudu, SIX runs","friendly full toss, Rayudu gleefully accepts as he steps out and swings this straight back over Shakib's head. This shot is as easy as stepping out in Hyderabad and finding a biryani store"

15.3,"Shakib to Rayudu, 1 run","charges down, Shakib cleverly fires this full and wide, Rayudu reaches out to squeeze this away to cover"
15.2,"Shakib to Dhoni, 1 run"," Pandey, one of the best fielders in the IPL, has dropped an absolute sitter at long-on!  Dhoni stepped out to launch this over the ropes, but didn't get the elevation as this lobbed off a thick inside edge. Oh, dear."

14.2,"Sandeep to Rayudu, 1 run","slower length ball on off, punched to long on"

This is interesting. Seemed like a review in hope than in conviction but the ball is shown to be missing the leg stump by the ball projection. This ball didn't have much to travel but the tech ology shows Hooda is not out"
17.2,"Bravo to Hooda, 1 wide","wide down the leg side, Bravo trying to go behind him but going too far with the angle"
17.1,"Bravo to Hooda, 2 runs","slower ball, offcutter, on a length, outside off, soft hands to push this towards long-on, which allows them to come back for the second"
16.6,"Thakur to Hooda, 1 run","into the pads, takes a single to deep midwicket"
16.5,"Thakur to Hooda, FOUR runs","mid-off is up, Hooda picks his spot, and manages to mis-hit this length ball over that man. The timing is not perfect but Hooda's idea is good: go over the man inside the circle"
16.4,"Thakur to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length again, driven to deep cover for another single"
16.3,"Thakur to Hooda, 1 run",driven to long-on for another single. CSK breathing easy momentarily
16.2,"Thakur to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
16.1,"Thakur to Williamson, OUT","sensational catch from Bravo. He has removed two set batsmen in two balls. Full and wide from Thakur, Williamson drives with an open face, over short third man, but from deep point Bravo runs to his left, goes about 20 metres, and takes this low to his left with both hands"
15.6,"Bravo to S Dhawan, OUT","oh, dear. He's scooped this straight to short fine. Dhawan tries to be too cute, gives away his intentions much before Bravo delivered, so he bowls a cutter at length on middle. No pace to work with and he hits it straight to Harbhajan even as thick rain clouds gather over the MCA Stadium  from the east. They look ominous too."
15.5,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run",steps out and punches this on the up to long off
15.4,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","right into the blockhole, squeezed wide of cover"
15.3,"Bravo to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","squeezes this behind point, no third man so that's headed just one way. It's raining boundaries"
15.2,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run","belts this full toss to long-off, another half-century for Williamson. His 10th overall in the IPL"
15.1,"Bravo to Williamson, FOUR runs","makes room and forces this length ball past extra cover, don't think Williamson realised how well he hit it till it raced away. Deep cover stood no chance"
14.6,"Willey to S Dhawan, no run",the bat breaks as he defends. Calls for a few spare ones from the dugout
14.5,"Willey to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","hammered back over the bowler's head, one bounce to the ropes. Too full on off. Absolutely picked the bones out of that"
14.4,"Willey to S Dhawan, FOUR runs"," Luck favours him this time!  Shaped to pull from outside off over deep midwicket, thick outside edge past the keeper to third man"
14.3,"Willey to Williamson, 1 run","goes short, this time Williamson goes back and helps it over point, good work by Jadeja"
14.2,"Willey to Williamson, FOUR runs","flat hit, just clears Bravo at mid-off. Too full, he got underneath the length and belted that"
14.1,"Willey to S Dhawan, 1 run","waits, waits and then steers this to backward point for a quick single"
13.6,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run",steps out and drills this inside out to wide long off
13.5,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, SIX runs",clobbered deep over deep midwicket! Stands his ground and simply swings through. Harbhajan dragged it down and got punished
13.4,"Harbhajan to Williamson, 1 run","reverse paddle, but no control, bounces in front of Watson running in from short third man"
13.3,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run","drifts into middle and leg, tucked towards midwicket"
13.2,"Harbhajan to Williamson, 1 run",steered behind point as they scamper a single
13.1,"Harbhajan to Williamson, SIX runs","steps out and belts this over the bowler's head. Harbhajan beat him in flight as he stepped out, but he reached out and swing this over. Delightful"
12.6,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 2 runs","too much width outside off, smeared into the gap at sweeper cover, Willey does the mopping up"
12.5,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, SIX runs","bowls length, gets punished. Dhawan flat-bats the pull over deep midwicket to bring up his half-century."
12.4,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","goes for a slog, has to fetch it from way outside off, gets a thick inside edge wide of Jadeja as they scamper a single"

11.5,"Watson to S Dhawan, 1 wide","full but swinging back in down leg, Dhawan swings and misses."
11.4,"Watson to S Dhawan, no run","full toss, above the waist? Not quite, punched straight to point.  Harsh call, Watson gets away with one. Above the waist "
11.3,"Watson to Williamson, 1 run","gets inside the line and helps this short ball up and over, down to third man"
11.2,"Watson to Williamson, SIX runs","swung over the ropes at deep square leg. Too short, he picked the length and smeared this from outside off. Clobbered that, deep into the stands. Coach Tom Moody has a big grin"
11.1,"Watson to Williamson, FOUR runs","sliced over point. Length on off, he backed away and then used his wrists to hit this where he wanted, superb."
10.6,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, no run","fired in outside off, Dhawan shapes to cut but is beaten"

10.3,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run",pulls this short ball to wide long on
10.2,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","too short, put away. Dhawan waits inside the crease and then gives it a proper whack through cover when it arrives."
10.1,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","length on off, steered to deep point"
9.6,"Bravo to S Dhawan, no run","full and angling away, left alone again"
9.5,"Bravo to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","goes through, Harbhajan makes a mess of it at short fine leg. Short and angling down, Dhawan pulls this straight to short fine, Harbhajan loses control as he tries an unnecessary slide. Gives away four when there should have been none"
9.4,"Bravo to S Dhawan, no run","slants a full delivery across, Dhawan watches this through to Dhoni"
9.3,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run",thumped to sweeper cover
9.2,"Bravo to Williamson, FOUR runs","short and angling down leg, Williamson helps this on its way to the fine leg fence. Too easy"

8.6,"Watson to Williamson, no run","backs away to slap this over point, ends up getting a thick inside edge back to the bowler"
8.5,"Watson to Williamson, no run",pulls and misses. Touch too full for him to play it
8.4,"Watson to S Dhawan, 1 run","steps out and blasts this past Watson's outstretched left hand on the followthrough, long-on was pretty straight"
8.3,"Watson to Williamson, 1 run","picked away! Too short, he's cracked the cut, Jadeja hares to his left to cut that off."
8.2,"Watson to Williamson, no run","straightens a length ball on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
8.1,"Watson to Williamson, no run","beaten by a lovely awayswinger. Shapes to drive, minimal feet movement as Williamson looked to lace that through extra cover"
7.6,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run",uses the depth of the crease nicely as he transfers weight back and punches this length ball to deep point.
7.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","steps out to slap that but is cramped for room by the length, bunted for a quick single"
7.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 wide","looks to belt this full delivery on the leg side behind square but the ball misses the pad, swings further down"
7.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 wide","huge wide, loses direction in trying to swing the ball back in, slips it down leg in the process"
7.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","crunching cover drive, Harbhajan may have got a hand on it to give Willey at mid-off some hope of pulling it back in, but he had no chance. Dhawan in total control, superb balance"

6.4,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run",rocks back and slaps the pull to long on
6.4,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 wide","he bowls this wide outside off, anticipating another chip down the track. Dhawan leaves, wide called and rightly so"
6.3,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","down the track, goes straight and hits it clean. Lovely swing to hit it up and over. Bounced just in front of the advertising triangle"
6.2,"Harbhajan to Williamson, 1 run",makes room and cuts this to deep point.  Brings up 500 runs this season 
6.1,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run","drifts one in at length on middle and leg, turned to square leg"

5.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye","misses the flick as this swings back in late to hit the pad, rolls to the leg side as they sneak in a leg bye"
5.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 wide","gets this to come back in but beats Dhawan's attempted tickle, through to Dhoni. Wide called."

4.4,"Thakur to Williamson, no run",driven but a superb one-handed stop by Rayudu at point
4.3,"Thakur to Williamson, no run",mistimes an attempted punch back to Shardul. Looked to flay this through point
4.2,"Thakur to Williamson, FOUR runs","pulled! And he's literally walloped this to the square leg boundary. Banged in short, Williamson picked the length early, swivelled back and executed the stroke superbly"
4.1,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run","length on middle and leg, tucked into the leg side for a quick single"
3.6,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","length ball moving away from off stump, watched through to the keeper"
3.5,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","shapes back in from outside off, Williamson plays down the wrong line. Bends back in to smack the pad. Angle would've taken it down leg"
3.4,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","beaten! Late movement from length, looked to steer behind point. Late on the stroke"
3.3,"Chahar to Hales, OUT","he's hit this straight to backward point, good catch because the ball was travelling. This was bowled full, it swung away late from the fourth stump and Hales only managed to slice this. Got this off the bottom, the bat face turned in his hands. Got the impression he was looking to hit it too hard. Chahar's impressive run in the IPL continues. Back from injury and among the wickets immediately."
3.2,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","angles one across, Dhawan isn't fully committed forward, manages to get this behind point"
3.1,"Chahar to Hales, 1 run",driven to mid off for a quick single
2.6,"Willey to S Dhawan, no run","leading edge, but safe. Closed the bat face early in trying to work this to the leg side"

2.4,"Willey to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",hoicked and he's timed this brilliantly. Not much movement so he just picked the length and walloped it to deep midwicket
2.3,"Willey to Hales, 1 run","goes for a big heave, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad, they scamper a run. Looked to smack this to deep midwicket, down to Balewadi, on the highway"

2.1,"Willey to S Dhawan, no run","touch fuller and just outside off, defended from the crease"
1.6,"Thakur to Hales, no run","late on the forward defense, gets it high on the bat. Effort delivery from Shardul."

1.4,"Thakur to S Dhawan, no run","ripper of a short ball on middle, zips through as Dhawan sways out of the way. In the 140s that delivery"
1.3,"Thakur to S Dhawan, no run","appeal for lbw, may have been struck a tad too high as it curved in from middle. Possibly saved by an inside edge too. Dhoni wasn't too convinced, Shardul went up immediately. In the end, they don't bother going for a review.  Replays suggest no inside edge, ball would've hit leg "
1.2,"Thakur to S Dhawan, no run","gets a good stride forward to defend, the ball curves back in late to roll back to the bowler off the inside edge"
1.1,"Thakur to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","thick inside edge, races to fine leg. Late swing back in from length for Shardul, Dhawan played outside the line. Shaved past leg stump"
0.6,"Chahar to Hales, no run","swings back in late, yorker length. Somehow manages to keep that out. Superb start from Chahar"
0.5,"Chahar to Hales, no run","poke and a miss! Moved away off the seam from length, he looked to steer behind point"

0.2,"Chahar to Hales, no run","touch full and moving away, defended firmly to mid off"
0.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of length on middle and leg, tucked into the leg side for a quick single"
18.6,"Boult to AB, SIX runs","ends it with a six! Sliced over long off. Full on off, and sent into the stands. Royal Challengers Bangalore win by five wickets! And Delhi Daredevils are now officially eliminated."
18.5,"Boult to Grandhomme, 1 run","full outside off, and driven to the man at deep extra cover"
18.4,"Boult to Grandhomme, no run","slower ball! Good length on off, and just missing the bat's outside edge. Goes to Pant on the bounce"
18.3,"Boult to AB, 1 run","full toss on leg stump, and tapped down the ground to long on for a single"
18.2,"Boult to AB, SIX runs","Spiderman! So quick to jump across outside off, and then slogs it - down on one knee - over deep midwicket. What quick movement. Kohli's in shock! Like Edvard Munch's Scream"
18.1,"Boult to Grandhomme, 1 run","full outside off, and angling away from the batsman. Driven over cover to the man in the deep"
17.6,"Patel to Grandhomme, 1 run","wide outside off, and driven to long off. CDG will keep strike"
17.6,"Patel to Grandhomme, 3 wide","yorker outside leg, and Pant can't hold on either! They manage to steal two, plus the extra run"
17.5,"Patel to Khan, OUT","what a shot, and what a catch! It was a low full toss on off, that he does well to ramp over the keeper's head. But Iyer had kept Shaw at a very fine fine leg, and it goes straight down his throat! Daredevils piling the pressure"
17.4,"Patel to Khan, no run","back of a length outside off, and the loopy bounce deceives the batsman. Tries to cut but can't connect!"
17.3,"Patel to Khan, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and cut away past the fielder at point! Sarfraz backs away to make some extra room, and then simply glances it past the infield"
17.3,"Patel to Khan, 1 wide","the bowler's losing his line. Full on leg, and going down the leg side again. Sarfraz kinda walked across before the ball was bowled, and that may have distracted the bowler"
17.2,"Patel to Khan, FOUR runs","lifted over cover! Pressure shot, and sent for four. Full just outside off, and he clears the infield. Good use of the bottom hand"
17.2,"Patel to Khan, 1 wide","full on leg stump, but going down leg. Sarfraz couldn't flick it away, but RCB collect the run anyway. He also has to bowl it again"
17.1,"Patel to Khan, no run","full toss on leg stump, and the umpire says 'not out!' They're reviewing for the lbw. Think that would miss leg stump, and yeah, missing the stumps completely. Daredevils lose their review"
16.6,"Boult to Khan, 1 run","yorker, and almost played on! Tries to dig it away, but the ball almost rolls on to the stumps. It doesn't, however, and that allows RCB to steal a quick run"
16.5,"Boult to AB, 1 run","full outside off, and another yorker that ABD can't put away. Driven to the man at deep extra cover"
16.4,"Boult to Khan, 1 run","full on leg stump, and some late swing on offer! Sarfraz confidently clips it off his toes to deep backward square"

16.2,"Boult to Khan, 1 run","good length on off, and angling across Sarfraz. He sticks his bat out and cuts it late to third man"
16.1,"Boult to Mandeep, OUT","crashes into middle stump! Twist in the tale? Straight on middle stump. Mandeep misses the pull, and the ball goes through the gates"
15.6,"Mishra to AB, 2 runs","good length outside off, but angling into him. Flat-batted to wide long on this time, and the commitment in his running earns RCB the second"
15.5,"Mishra to Mandeep, 1 run","full just outside off, and he comes down the wicket, but bunts it to long on"
15.4,"Mishra to Mandeep, no run","full on middle, and it's the slider! Goes straight through and his attempted defense finds the bat's outside edge. Goes to point"
15.3,"Mishra to Mandeep, no run","full just outside off, and pushed to the man at cover. Sliding effort saves the run"
15.2,"Mishra to Mandeep, 2 runs","full outside off, but he connects with the sweep. Not timed well, and that actually allows Mandeep to come back for the second. Team 150"
15.1,"Mishra to AB, 1 run","low full toss on middle, and AB drills it down the ground to long on. They walk across for the single"
14.6,"Dala to Mandeep, no run","full outside off, and once again forcing Mandeep to reach at it. Mistimes it to mid on"
14.5,"Dala to Mandeep, 2 runs","full outside off, and Mandeep's forced to reach at it. Slaps it towards point, but takes a thick outside edge to the man at third man"
14.4,"Dala to Mandeep, no run","good length on off, and clipped off his hips to square leg"
14.3,"Dala to Mandeep, no run","back of a length outside off, and carved off the back foot. Straight to point"
14.2,"Dala to Mandeep, SIX runs","good length on middle, but angling down the leg side. Mandeep, however, swivels and pulls this over deep backward square. Great rotation off his toes"
14.1,"Dala to Mandeep, no run","full on off stump, and driven to mid off. Says no to the single"
13.6,"Mishra to Mandeep, 1 run","good length on off, and turning away from the batsman. Flat-bats it down the ground to long on. The final time out of the evening too"

13.4,"Mishra to Mandeep, 1 run","full just outside off, and driven down the ground to long off"
13.3,"Mishra to Mandeep, no run","wrong'un to start off. Full on middle, but turning into his pads. Mandeep can't flick it away"
13.2,"Mishra to Kohli, OUT","feathers one to Pant! Done by the turn. Mishra's delighted, Kohli's frustrated. It was full outside off, and turning away from Kohli. He tried to play the inside out drive, but the ball takes some extra bounce and finds the outside of his bat. Credit to Pant for holding on though"
13.1,"Mishra to Kohli, FOUR runs","whipped! What great use of the wrists. Full on middle, and he's quick to gauge the length and pounces onto it in a flash. No chance for Roy at long on"
12.6,"Patel to AB, 2 runs","slower ball, but wide outside off. AB thumps it in front of cover, but the man in the deep does well to clean up"
12.5,"Patel to AB, SIX runs","over long on! And that's his 26th IPL fifty. Overpitched on middle stump, and he gets his front foot out of the way to thump it over the boundary"
12.4,"Patel to AB, FOUR runs","slapped past point! Outside off, and AB cuts it furiously to the boundary. Reach in no time. AB's follow through reminded me of Dhoni's helicopter. That swirl"
12.3,"Patel to AB, no run","almost chopped on! Good length outside off, and AB tries to cut it away. Bottom-edges it, and the ball just about misses the top of off stump"
12.2,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","slower ball, but full toss on middle. Mistimed towards the leg side"
12.1,"Patel to Kohli, SIX runs","short-arm jab! And no better way to get to a hundred-run partnership. Good length on middle, and Kohli takes a few steps down the ground, then lifts his back leg, and completes the shot by whipping it over deep midwicket. Classic"
11.6,"Lamichhane to AB, no run","full on leg stump, and turning into AB's pads. Blocks it off the front foot. End of Lamichhane's debut with the ball"
11.5,"Lamichhane to AB, SIX runs","flighted on off, but AB nonchalantly walks across to the off side before lifting it over deep backward square. The fielder in the deep was getting under it, but just clears the man there!"
11.4,"Lamichhane to Kohli, 1 run","good length on leg, but it's the wrong'un this time! Creeps onto Kohli's body, and he whips it off his hips to deep square leg"
11.3,"Lamichhane to AB, 1 run","full outside off, and AB goes down on one knee to sweep it from outside off stump. Not timed well though"
11.2,"Lamichhane to Kohli, 1 run","full on leg, but spinning across AB. He taps it with soft hands towards midwicket, and they call early for the single. They want the second, but Sandeep did well to cover a lot of ground"
11.1,"Lamichhane to AB, 1 run","short on middle, and turning away from AB. He goes onto the back foot and drags this towards the midwicket boundary"
10.6,"Patel to Kohli, 2 runs","back of a length outside off, but he's taken the pace off this time. The batsman cuts this off the back foot to deep point"
10.5,"Patel to AB, 1 run","short outside off, and drilled straight down to Boult at long on. Just one"
10.4,"Patel to AB, FOUR runs","makes it look soo easy! Full on off, and AB shuffles across to the off side, gets down on one knee, and ramps it over the keeper's left! Mr. 360!"
10.3,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","Harshal hits Kohli this time! No malice though. A soft shot towards cover had the batsmen running for a single, but Harshal ran there to try and break the stumps at the non-striker's, but the throw finds Kohli instead"
10.2,"Patel to Kohli, no run",Is Harshal okay? Looks alright. Full outside off and Kohli came dancing down the ground before driving it towards the bowler. Hits his palm on the full!
10.1,"Patel to Kohli, no run","good length on off, but angling into Kohli. Tries to punch towards cover, but comes off the bat's inside half. Goes towards midwicket"
9.6,"Mishra to AB, no run","full outside off again, and this time the drive's been crunched! But stopped by the fielder at cover"
9.5,"Mishra to AB, SIX runs","flighted outside off, but too wide. AB takes a big stride towards the pitch of the ball, and lifts it over the extra-cover boundary. The margin of error that the bowler can afford is minimal"
9.4,"Mishra to AB, no run","full just outside off, and defended back to Mishra"
9.3,"Mishra to Kohli, 1 run","flat on middle, and sliding through to Kohli. Punched off the back foot to the long-on boundary"
9.3,"Mishra to Kohli, 1 wide","wild spin, and well stopped by Pant! Full outside off, and legspin that goes further away from Kohli. Forced Pant to dive to his right"
9.2,"Mishra to AB, 1 run","almost a yorker on middle stump, and AB bunts it away towards the vacant midwicket region. Forces the bowler to go chasing after it"
9.1,"Mishra to Kohli, 1 run","flighted outside off, and driven with the spin. Smothers it to deep extra cover"
8.6,"Dala to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and this time there's some extra bounce. Kohli works it towards square leg, and that's the time out"
8.5,"Dala to AB, 1 run","slower ball, outside off, and de Villiers muscles this towards the leg side. That area is packed by outfielders though"
8.4,"Dala to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and that's been flat-batted to long on for a walking single"
8.3,"Dala to Kohli, FOUR runs","back of a length on middle, and that's been glanced fine down the leg side! Fifty for him, his 34th in the IPL"
8.2,"Dala to Kohli, 2 runs","slower ball, but full toss on middle stump. Flicked off his pads to deep midwicket, but he calls nice and early for two. Dala took a tumble on his bowling followthrough"
8.1,"Dala to Kohli, no run","full on off, and Kohli chops it onto his toes! Ouch. It was almost a yorker, and Kohli inside-edges his cover drive"
7.6,"Mishra to AB, no run",comes down the track to a length ball and pats it down the track
7.5,"Mishra to AB, SIX runs","pitched up and spinning away a tad outside off, and AB carves it over long-off"

6.2,"Lamichhane to Kohli, no run","length on middle and off, blocked"
6.1,"Lamichhane to Kohli, FOUR runs","too full outside off, another languid drive from Kohli. Smooth swing and tremendous follow-through as he crunches through extra cover"
5.6,"Boult to AB, FOUR runs","short, angled across, AB now latches onto a pull that beats deep square leg diving to his left"
5.5,"Boult to Kohli, 1 run","angled into him, and flicked away wide of long-on"
5.4,"Boult to Kohli, SIX runs","slower ball, the off-cutter, picked early and mowed it over long-off. Terrific timing"

4.6,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","short outside off, walks across and nudges to the on side"
4.5,"Patel to Kohli, FOUR runs","he's batting like a dream. Kohli's determined to see RCB home tonight, and he backs away to this fuller one and chips it over mid-off with the full face of the bat"
4.4,"Patel to AB, 1 run","full toss outside off, punched to long-on where Abhishek Sharma gets around it"
4.3,"Patel to AB, FOUR runs","short outside off, punched through the gap at cover. Elegant"
4.2,"Patel to AB, no run","short outside off, stays leg side of it and probably moved away too much as he skews it to mid-off off the toe-end while slapping it"
4.1,"Patel to AB, no run","length ball outside off, comes into him, and he drills off the inside of the bat to mid-on"
3.6,"Dala to Kohli, 2 runs","short, gets inside of it and tucks it away to deep backward square and pushes the fielder for a brace"
3.5,"Dala to Kohli, no run","nudges this one late, gets a bit of bat but it's tickled to short fine leg"
3.4,"Dala to Kohli, FOUR runs","now he goes full and angles it in, and Kohli backs away and carves a drive through the covers. This is splendid batting"
3.3,"Dala to Kohli, SIX runs",that's a stunning shot. You won't see too many better hits than that. Picks a length ball from outside off and wristily whips it over cow corner. Flat and hard. That's an unbelievable strike
3.3,"Dala to Kohli, 1 wide",drifts down the leg side
3.2,"Dala to Kohli, FOUR runs",backs away to a short ball and the angle's helpfully coming into him as he smokes a pull to deep midwicket

2.6,"Lamichhane to AB, no run","pitched up outside off, drilled to mid-on"
2.5,"Lamichhane to AB, no run", pins AB on the pad firs ball but the impact is outside off. Long stride across - that's the only thing that saved him there
2.4,"Lamichhane to Patel, OUT","that's plumb. First wicket for young Lamichhane. And it's a beautiful wicket. Nicely pitched up around middle, not giving him an inch to free his arms. Parthiv gets down to sweep and the ball spins in subtly to pin him in front of middle"
2.3,"Lamichhane to Patel, FOUR runs","tossed up but with too much room outside off, shovelled straight and flat down the ground"

0.5,"Lamichhane to Patel, 4 byes",gets down for a sweep but the ball escapes from underneath the bat as it's too full and he fails to get underneath it. Runs past the keeper as well. Harshal Patel chases it down and slides in front of the boundary but he has made contact with the ropes

19.5,"Siraj to Abhishek, 1 run","yorker outside off, and smacks it to deep extra cover. He'll finish on 46 and Shankar takes strike"
19.4,"Siraj to Abhishek, FOUR runs","full on middle and leg, and this time it's been drilled straight back past the bowler. Siraj does well to get away, so does the umpire, and the ball beats both men in the deep! Moves on to 45"
19.3,"Siraj to Abhishek, SIX runs","remember the name! Even though it's so generic. It's the offcutter on off stump, and Sharma gets his front leg out of the way before thumping it over long off"
19.2,"Siraj to Abhishek, no run","full outside leg, and Sharma's attempted ramp over fine leg doesn't come off. Not a wide because the batsman moved around so much"
19.1,"Siraj to Shankar, 1 run","yorker on middle, that all Shankar can do is work it towards cow corner. Gets Sharma on strike"
18.6,"Southee to Shankar, 1 run","takes the pace completely off this, only 97.5kph. Shankar tries to slog it over cover, but inside-edges it towards square leg"
18.5,"Southee to Shankar, no run","appeal for caught behind, but not given! And RCB don't have a review either. It was short on middle, and he pull didn't come off. RCB believe he's top-edged it to the keeper, but replays say no"
18.4,"Southee to Abhishek, 1 run","nice yorker outside off, but Sharma is up to the challenge nonetheless. Bends his knee, opens his bat's face, and squeezes it away to deep point"
18.3,"Southee to Shankar, 1 run","slower ball, but wide outside off. Shankar waits for it this time, before driving it square. Negi at deep cover though"
18.2,"Southee to Abhishek, 1 run","full toss outside off, and he (almost) makes full use of that free-hit! Smacked it to the long-off boundary, but Umesh takes a catch there. They take one"
18.2,"Southee to Shankar, (no ball) 1 run","it's the slower ball, and pushed full and wide outside off. Shankar is forced to check his big wind-up, and muscles this down the ground to long on. Free hit because there weren't enough people inside the circle"
18.1,"Southee to Abhishek, 1 run","wide yorker outside off, but Sharma's through his attempted drive already. Slices it over point to the man at the boundary"
17.6,"Siraj to Abhishek, 1 run","good length on middle, and Sharma walks across to the off side to try and ramp it past fine leg, but mistimes it this time. He'll keep strike nonetheless"
17.5,"Siraj to Shankar, 1 run","full just outside off, but too close to his body for the drive. Mistimes it towards cover point on this occasion"
17.4,"Siraj to Shankar, FOUR runs","full on off, and that's been whipped! Great use of the wrists, and that's raced away to the fine-leg boundary. The man there was just too square"
17.3,"Siraj to Abhishek, 1 run","full on off stump, and he comes down the wicket. Effectively yorks himself, but manages to dig it away towards cover"
17.2,"Siraj to Abhishek, SIX runs","good length on off, but Sharma's in some mood tonight! Stands tall, and ramps it over third man! Pure timing"
17.1,"Siraj to Shankar, 1 run","full outside off, and drilled straight down the ground past Siraj's left. Long off's there though"
16.6,"Southee to Abhishek, 2 runs","full outside leg, but he's prepared for that length. Comes dancing down the wicket and plays it inside out over cover. Falls in no man's land"
16.5,"Southee to Abhishek, SIX runs","slower ball, but Sharma's sent that into the mid-wicket boundary for six more! Stays on the back foot, and thumps it into the stands"
16.4,"Southee to Abhishek, SIX runs","check drives over Southee's head! Hold that pose, son! It's the cutter on leg stump, and he simply lifts it into the stands. Oof"
16.3,"Southee to Abhishek, FOUR runs","dropped by Siraj at third man! Good length on off, and Sharma's attempted cover-drive takes the thick outside edge. Flew straight to third man, but it goes through his hands as he tries to dive forward"
16.3,"Southee to Abhishek, 1 wide","short, and wide outside off. Sharma backs away, but chooses not to play at it"
16.2,"Southee to Abhishek, 2 runs","back of a length on middle, and he tries to muscle it straight down the ground. Slaps it over Southee, but off the bat's top half. The poor timing actually allows the batsman to come back for the second run"
16.1,"Southee to Shankar, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and he opens his bat's face to play it towards point. They scamper across quickly for the run after a slight miscommunication"
15.6,"Siraj to Abhishek, no run","good length on off, and that's been fended away from his body. But takes the bat's toe end, and comes to Siraj's left. He tries to take a diving catch, but the ball was just too low!"
15.5,"Siraj to Abhishek, no run","good length on middle stump, and tapped back to Siraj off the back foot. Sharma wants the single, but Siraj is quick to recover"

15.3,"Siraj to Abhishek, FOUR runs","full outside off, and that's beautifully lifted to the long-off boundary. What a start to your IPL career!"
15.2,"Siraj to Shankar, 1 run","back of a length on off, and it's the offcutter. Clipped off his hips to midwicket, and that gets the debutant on strike"
15.1,"Siraj to Iyer, OUT","full on off, and angling into his pads. Iyer lifts it off his toes towards long on, but Kohli's manning the cow-corner boundary. Holds on to it despite being some ten feet inside the boundary line. Iyer's sluggish innings ends. Time out as well"
14.6,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and extra bounce this time! Mistimes a leg-side whip to the man at midwicket"

14.3,"Yadav to Shankar, FOUR runs","back of a length on middle, and Shankar opens the leg side and pulls it fine past short fine leg! Uses his wrists to play it well"
14.2,"Yadav to Shankar, no run","nice shape! Good length outside off and shaping slightly inwards. He tried to glance it fine, but the ball just goes past his outside edge"
14.1,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","good length on middle, and Iyer walks across to the off side to tap it towards midwicket"
13.6,"Chahal to Shankar, 2 runs","flighted on middle, and the straight drive takes a leading edge over cover! Just over the fielder, and that means more work for AB at long off"

13.4,"Chahal to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length on off, but Iyer stays on his crease. Punches it to long on this time"

13.1,"Chahal to Shankar, no run","flat on middle, and going straight through. Shankar goes onto his back foot, and taps it towards mid on"
12.6,"Ali to Pant, OUT","excellent sliding catch at long on! AB the man. It was full outside off, and Pant is forced to reach at it. Manages to lift it towards the long-on boundary, but de Villiers races across to his left to complete a difficult catch"
12.5,"Ali to Pant, FOUR runs","full on leg, and he's once again down on one knee. Swept over the man at square leg for four more. Honestly, it was just a one-handed flick"
12.4,"Ali to Iyer, 1 run","angles into Iyer's pads, and he smothers it with the turn to the man at deep midwicket. Another walking single for Daredevils"
12.3,"Ali to Pant, 1 run","good length on middle, and Pant comes skipping down the ground. Taps it towards the vacant area near midwicket to collect another run"
12.2,"Ali to Pant, no run",grip off the surface! Takes the outside edge of Pant's bat as he looks to defend. The ball flies away towards point

11.6,"Chahal to Pant, 2 runs","misfield from Sarfraz! Full outside leg, and swept to short fine leg. The ball slides under Sarfraz at short fine leg, which eventually allows them to take the second. Chahal's not happy at all"
11.5,"Chahal to Pant, no run","drift in the air, and the ball lands full outside off. It's turning further away from Pant, so he's forced to reach at it. Misses completely"
11.4,"Chahal to Iyer, 1 run","full on leg stump, and would've gone down for a wide. But Iyer chases it, and flicks it to deep square leg"
11.3,"Chahal to Pant, 1 run","good length on middle, and drags his pull to deep midwicket. Man in the deep"

10.2,"Ali to Pant, no run","quicker ball, but the appeal is turned down. Full on middle, and hits Pant's in front of leg stump. Reckon that would've gone down leg"

9.6,"Grandhomme to Iyer, FOUR runs","deft touch! Full outside off, but Iyer loves that region. Decides to cut it late, and opens the bat's face slightly past the keeper's right, and the quick outfield does the rest"
9.5,"Grandhomme to Pant, 1 run",drags a length ball towards the on side. only to midwicket
9.4,"Grandhomme to Iyer, 1 run","AB and Kohli mess up a catch! Never thought I'd ever type this sentence. It was full on off, and Iyer slices his drive. It's in the air for ages, and AB tries to get under it from cover. Kohli's coming from long off, and the ball lands between both of them! AB went for the final attempt though"
9.3,"Grandhomme to Pant, 1 run","wild! Short, and outside off, but Pant flat-bats it straight back to CDG. The bowler stuck his right hand out, but the ball doesn't stick"
9.2,"Grandhomme to Iyer, 1 run","full on off, and he's going for the slog! Swings across the line, but falls short of Mohammad Siraj's diving effort in the deep. Did he start running in too late?"

There's a horrible mix-up, they then go for the single. Russell swoops down on the ball, turns, and aims to effect a direct hit at the non-striker's end. He, however, loses his balance and collapses.

This is a fiery bouncer, Agarwal had decided yesterday that he'll pull this, got big on him but he went through with the stroke but showed signs of pulling out very late. But by then, the deed was done. Sensational from DreRuss. I have no reason why the onfield umpire even went upstairs to check for the no-ball. Agarwal didn't control the pull because he wasn't even looking at the delivery. His poor IPL season after a magnificent breakout domestic season continues."
5.4,"Russell to Gayle, OUT","the bouncer has done the trick! Pacy bouncer, Gayle is late on the pull and in doing so, feathers one to a leaping Karthik. Fist pumps. One Jamaican gets the other"

2.3,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Rahul, 1 run",cuts back in to hit the pad and deflect to the off side as he looks to turn to the leg side. Replays suggest a thin inside edge
2.2,"JPR Scantlebury-Searles to Rahul, FOUR runs","too much width, Rahul cuts to the point boundary. Sehwag would've been proud of that. Destroyer of the short ball through the cut. No chance for square third man"

5.2,"Tye to Lynn, OUT","Tye drags his length back, cramps the batsman for room, and bowls him. Short and angling into the body from over the wicket, Lynn swivels into a pull. The ball hits the thigh, then his arm, the ball swivels, and bounces up to trim the bails. Lucky break for Kings XI"
5.1,"Tye to Lynn, SIX runs","Lynn welcomes AJ Tye, the purple cap holder, with a straight six. Pitched up on middle, right in his swinging arc, lifted over the bowler's head"
4.6,"Barinder Sran to Narine, FOUR runs","Narine clears his front leg and clears mid-on. Much fuller, another slower ball on middle, Narine is set to tee off. He does not have enough pace to work with. Instead, he holds his shape, manufactures his own pace, and swings it over mid-on for four"

3.2,"Mujeeb to Narine, no run","Belted back to Mujeeb, but the ball bursts out. He drops a difficult return catch. Narine runs down the track, meets a half-volley on off, and slams it back, the bowler attempts the catch and in the process hurts his bowling hand. He needs some attention from the physio. Such chances stick or they don't.  Adding injury to insult: Mujeeb has gone off the field"
3.1,"Mujeeb to Lynn, 1 run","on a length and outside off, shuffles across and sweeps it flat and hard to short fine leg, where the big man Gayle dives to his left in instalments and somehow stops the ball"

19.5,"Bravo to Buttler, 2 runs","Buttler has done it for Royals! He is mobbed by his team-mates. He is now embraced by his England team-mate Ben Stokes. Slower and fuller outside off, Buttler slices it to Watson at cover. Watson has a shy at the non-striker's end despite Buttler making his crease. He concedes an overthrow. Game, set, and match for Royals. Dhoni shakes his head. Sums up the night for CSK"
19.4,"Bravo to Buttler, SIX runs","length ball outside off, another slower ball, Buttler waits for it and slugs it over midwicket for six. Buttler manufactures his own pace. Gowtham lets out a cathartic roar in the dug out"

17.6,"Bravo to Buttler, 1 run",Has Dhoni dropped this? Buttler shuffled across off even before the bowler delivered. He does not get enough bat on the scoop to fine leg. He tickles it away.

11.2,"Bravo to Samson, OUT","Samson run out ball watching! Plays a glorious late cut to find backward point. Looks at his partner then at the fielder. Is caught looking at the fielder when his partner responds and comes through for the run. They're both at the same end, nearly. Buttler falls to his knees - he knows what's coming. A throw on the bounce to Bravo as Samson makes a desperate attempt to run back. Bravo receives, turns and flicks it onto the stumps with an underarm throw. Raina was the man at backward point"
11.1,"Bravo to Buttler, 1 run","slower ball outside off, forceful drive on the up to extra cover's right. He puts in a dive but can't stop cleanly"
10.6,"Willey to Samson, 2 runs",chipped over the bowler. Doesn't look in control at first but this has flown off the bat as he tries to drive through the line. Bends inwards and keeps going away from long-off who has to parry it to long-on
10.5,"Willey to Samson, FOUR runs",thick outside edge and it's too fast for Harbhajan at backward point! Same strategy - backs away to try and go over extra cover. Except he makes too much room to reach this full ball outside off with the middle of the bat. Carved over the fielders behind square

9.5,"Bravo to Samson, 1 run",slower ball floated up at off stump. Reaches the pitch and flicks through midwicket
9.4,"Bravo to Samson, no run","ping-pong. Bravo fields to his left as Samson punches firmly on the up, and then attempts to chuck it back at the stumps. He's off-balance though and the throw is wayward"

16.3,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 wide",slower ball dug in too short according to the umpire. Dhoni lets this float in the corridor. Didn't look so high to me but I was wrong. That was way over the head
16.2,"Archer to Billings, 1 run","yorker speared in at middle stump, backs away and jams it towards long-off"
16.1,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 run",slower ball at a length on off stump. Gets deep in the crease and taps it into the leg side off the back foot
15.6,"Unadkat to Billings, 2 runs","shuffles across, meets the offcutter outside off and clips to long-on"
15.5,"Unadkat to Billings, no run","slower ball, skids away rapidly off the pitch as Billings it rooted to the crease chasing this with his hands. Doesn't get close to connection"
15.4,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run","slower ball in the corridor, back of a length. Into the pull too early and has to end up dragging this to fine leg"
15.3,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 2 runs",offcutter at a length on off stump. Steps out and flicks uppishly to long-on
15.2,"Unadkat to Billings, 1 run","short ball on off stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
15.1,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run","length at off stump, walks at it and punches to mid-off on the up"
14.6,"Sodhi to Dhoni, 1 run",lovely bowling. Keeps putting it up there slowly. Keeps them on the back foot. Even Dhoni can only tuck it into the square leg region. What an over
14.5,"Sodhi to Dhoni, no run",short of a length and spinning away from off stump. Tapped to extra over off the back foot
14.4,"Sodhi to Billings, 1 leg bye","length ball at off, steps out and looks to go cross-batted. Gets a deflection into the leg side off this pad"
14.3,"Sodhi to Billings, no run",Billings tied. Another floated length ball and he's caught deep in the crease trying to flick against the turn. It runs back down the pitch
14.2,"Sodhi to Billings, no run",short of a length and very slow again. Slapped straight to extra cover off the back foot
14.1,"Sodhi to Billings, no run","nicely done. Tossed up at off stump, finds the leading edge as he looks to flick against the turn into the midwicket region"

13.5,"Stokes to Billings, no run",yorker at off stump and he nearly gets trapped with a front foot plant across. Manages to tap it into the off side
13.4,"Stokes to Billings, FOUR runs",sweeeeet. Billings meets the offcutter at the pitch outside off and laughs at his mate as he bludgeons this drive wide of mid-off
13.3,"Stokes to Billings, no run","length ball on leg stump, tapped to long-on on the up"
13.2,"Stokes to Dhoni, 1 run","length and angled in at the body, stabbed into the midwicket region"
13.1,"Stokes to Dhoni, no run","length on off stump, punched to mid-off on the up"
12.6,"Sodhi to Raina, OUT","taken at short fine. Binny pedals backwards and falls awkwardly on his back, but he's held on with the reverse cup. Another ungainly hoick by Raina against a googly he hasn't picked. More a sweep, in fact. Regulation top-edge taken at 45"
12.5,"Sodhi to Dhoni, 3 runs",leg stump ball at a length. On the front foot this time as he taps it fine on its head. Long leg has a lot of running to his right before putting in the slide
12.4,"Sodhi to Dhoni, 2 runs","googly, into the pads on a length. Stands tall and tucks it fine off the back foot"
12.3,"Sodhi to Raina, 1 run",leading edge as Raina steps out against a googly and has no idea. Nowhere near the pitch of this leg side delivery turning away from him. It lands short of short third man

12.1,"Sodhi to Raina, 1 run","length on off stump, leans in and tucks it through square leg"

11.5,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 run",short ball aimed at the ribs. Quickly gets on his toes and stabs it though the leg side
11.4,"Archer to Raina, 1 run",short ball in the channel. Gets on one leg and hurriedly bunts this into the square leg region
11.4,"Archer to Raina, 1 wide",another one. Same pattern - full and down leg. Raina falling over into the off side trying to flick but that's fizzing past
11.4,"Archer to Raina, 1 wide",goes around the wicket and fires one straight down leg side. Archer hasn't found any rhythm against Raina. Switch to over the wicket maybe?
11.3,"Archer to Watson, OUT",got him! Jofra making it talk with his pace! Short of a length ball on off stump and once again he's late on the pull. This time it's angled in at his body so the swinging room is lesser. It hits the bat higher. Buttler skips to his left and tells short fine leg to stay out of his way to put his gloves to good use
11.2,"Archer to Watson, FOUR runs",clears the keeper with a top edge. Same ball that got Rayudu to chop on. Except Watson looks for the pull to this quick short ball outside off
11.1,"Archer to Watson, 2 runs","length ball skidded in at off stump. Stays put, makes some room and guides it to third man"
10.6,"Gowtham to Watson, 1 run",creamed but it's cut off by long-off on the bounce. Got nicely to the pitch of this and launched it over the bowler's head
10.5,"Gowtham to Raina, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, dabbed to short third man with the turn"
10.4,"Gowtham to Raina, FOUR runs","nicely done. Raina has almost become a specialist at this one-legged, no-balance shot to fine leg. This time it's off the spinner of course. Length ball fired down leg and he swivels to tap it on its head"
10.3,"Gowtham to Watson, 1 run",length ball pushed wide outside off and he slashes away from the body to get this to the sweeper on the bounce
10.2,"Gowtham to Raina, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, punched to long-off off the back foot"
10.1,"Gowtham to Watson, 1 run",fires this into the blockhole at off stump. Can't get the bat swing through this and he slices it into the cover region

9.6,"Unadkat to Watson, 1 wide",another off-side wide from Unadkat

9.4,"Unadkat to Watson, no run","back of a length and nips back in from round the stumps to ping the thigh pad, but this heading past the leg stump"
9.3,"Unadkat to Watson, SIX runs","hip-high short ball outside off, slower ball, Watson waits for the ball to arrive. Then lines it up and smokes it over midwicket"

8.4,"Sodhi to Raina, 1 run","back of a length and outside off, forced to the leg side past the left of Sodhi"
8.3,"Sodhi to Raina, SIX runs","tossed up outside off, not sure if that was a googly, Raina stretches out and slugs a sweep over midwicket"
8.2,"Sodhi to Watson, 1 run","tossed outside off, Watson ventures down the track, gets close to the pitch, and belts it past the left hand of Sodhi. Relays suggest Sodhi just finger-tipped it away. Only a harsh man will call it a drop. Sodhi, in fact, saved three for his side"
8.1,"Sodhi to Watson, SIX runs","half-tracker on middle, right in Watson's swinging arc, he sits deep in the crease and launches a pull over midwicket. First boundary for CSK after 21 balls. Watson finally connects with one"

5.6,"Unadkat to Watson, no run","just short of a good length and outside off, Watson is early into a cut, loses his shape, and chops the ball only as far as cover"
5.5,"Unadkat to Watson, no run","slower ball, floated on middle, Watson stays leg-side of the ball and flays to mid-off"
5.4,"Unadkat to Watson, no run","short on middle, the ball does not come on, Watson struggling for timing. Drags a pull to short fine leg off the inside half"

4.4,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR runs","hip-high short ball outside off, slower one, Raina picks it up and swats it over midwicket for his fifth boundary. Raina setting the pace for CSK"

17.4,"Plunkett to Williamson, 1 run",full toss above waist height and he pulls it for a single. Not given a no ball! Williamson looks at the umpire and can't believe it. That was certainly above his waist at the point of contact and he was on his toes too

5.1,"Boult to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",gets a length delivery and he whacks that from outside off to wide and over mid on for four
4.6,"Plunkett to Williamson, FOUR runs","143.6kmh, another late dab from Williamson and this time he sends it much finer to easily beat the third man for a four"
4.5,"Plunkett to S Dhawan, 1 run",angled into Dhawan from back of length and he tucks it to leg for another single
4.4,"Plunkett to Williamson, 1 run","short ball, he mistimes the pull and makes it just in time for the quick single as the throw came in from midwicket"
4.3,"Plunkett to Williamson, 2 runs",a late dab is running away for four towards third man but Harshal sprints and dives to his left and saves two. Excellent effort
4.2,"Plunkett to Williamson, no run","on good length just outside off, solid straight-bat defence from KW"
4.1,"Plunkett to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye","135kmh and angling in, Dhawan tries to loft it on the leg side but only gets a leg bye"
3.6,"Patel to Williamson, 2 runs","gives him the charge, Harshal sends it slower around 128kmh, Williamson slogs for a thick egde to deep midwicket"
3.5,"Patel to Williamson, no run","full on the pads, Williamson drives it nicely with the wrists but straight to short midwicket"
3.4,"Patel to S Dhawan, 1 run","touch closer to off, there's still room and he drives it late to deep backward point"
3.3,"Patel to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",too much room and Dhawan smacks that through the square region with a full swing of the arms for a cracking four
3.2,"Patel to Williamson, 1 run","slower on the stumps at 120kmh, Williamson waits and helps it to leg for one"
3.1,"Patel to S Dhawan, 1 run",charges down for the 142kmh delivery but it angles into him from around the wicket and he gets an edge onto his pads
2.6,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, 1 run",drives the low full toss down to deepish mid-on for one
2.5,"Nadeem to Williamson, 1 run",hint of room and he sticks his bat out for one on the off side
2.4,"Nadeem to Williamson, no run","flat and quick at 11kmh outside off, driven hard to cover"
2.3,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, 1 run",charges down the track and drills it down to mid off for a quick single
2.2,"Nadeem to Williamson, 1 run",takes a step down this time and turns the ball to midwicket for one
2.1,"Nadeem to Williamson, no run","targets the stumps, Williamson goes back to defend dangerously and brings his bat down just in time"
1.6,"Patel to Williamson, 1 run",runs it down to his favourite area - third man - for one
1.5,"Patel to Hales, OUT","in the block hole, that's plumb! What a reply from Harshal. Hales went back and across early to cover the stumps and steer it to the leg side, and Harshal sends down a slow offcutter with some revs, Hales misjudges the pace completely and is trapped right in front"
1.4,"Patel to Hales, FOUR runs","another short ball, this time towards leg and he knows fine leg is in. Waits for it and pulls it to the long leg boundary for four more"
1.3,"Patel to Hales, FOUR runs","cuts in the air, it lands short and wide of a diving backward point and runs away for four. Too short, not the kind of length you can ball to Hales. Or anyone"
1.2,"Patel to Hales, no run","slightly slow in the mid-120s, just around off and he blocks it back"
1.1,"Patel to S Dhawan, 1 run","bangs it in a bit short, Dhawan taps it to cover point for one"
0.6,"Boult to Hales, no run",full again and he drills it down to mid-off
0.5,"Boult to Hales, FOUR runs",too short and pulled away! That length gave Hales ample time to stay back and hammer it wide of mid-on to the wide long on boundary
0.4,"Boult to Hales, 2 runs","drives again for the inswinger on the off stump, but an inside edge gives him to two square leg"
0.3,"Boult to Hales, no run","absolutely full and he crunches it straight to Maxwell at short cover. Pant collects the throw and screams ""come on, boys!"""
0.2,"Boult to Hales, no run","brings the length shorter and swings it into Hales's body this time, cramped up for room and he takes it near the abdomen"
0.1,"Boult to Hales, no run","bit of inswing from well outside off, Hales drives it away to extra cover"
19.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, SIX runs","full toss, waist-high on middle, Pant swings this cleanly to clobber this over deep midwicket. All of them in orange come up to shake hands. Stand up and applaud, this has been a majestic innings.  138 runs off the last 10 overs "
19.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, SIX runs","one-handed six over long-on. He can walk on water tonight? Bhuvi shortens his length, Pant holds his shape and then wallops this"
19.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, SIX runs","pulled into the fine leg boundary. Bhuvi does short, this didn't have much pace so Pant picked the length early and helped it along"
19.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, FOUR runs","another scoop, another one that beats short third man. He's toying with the bowlers now. Excellent awareness, knows exactly where Bhuvi will go. Full and wide outside off, brings out that back flick. Wow"
19.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, FOUR runs",the scoop over short third man. Gives you the impression he's going leg side but then spots the full and wide delivery and at the last moment opens the bat face to hit this up and over
19.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, OUT",slices this slog to long off. Hales makes no mistake. Wonder if this was a little too ambitious from Maxwell? Was he better off giving strike to Pant? Looked to go straight but got no timing.
18.6,"Kaul to Maxwell, 1 run",belts this full toss to sweeper cover
18.5,"Kaul to Maxwell, FOUR runs","time for Maxwell to join the show. Waist-high full toss, and he flat-bats this straight over the bowler's head. No chance for long on and long off."
18.4,"Kaul to Pant, 1 run",drills this full delivery to long off.
18.3,"Kaul to Pant, no run","shaped to paddle this fine but Kaul went full and wide, Pant looked to angle it past short third man but couldn't get any bat"
18.2,"Kaul to Pant, FOUR runs","muscles this full toss one bounce to the deep midwicket boundary, brings his first IPL century. He's pumped, angry gestures to the dressing room, lets out a roar and then soaks in the applause of his home fans and mates."
18.1,"Kaul to Pant, no run","width outside off, drilled to the man at the edge of the ring at cover"
17.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, 1 run","short on middle and leg, is off balance as he pulls but just manages to beat square leg"
17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, FOUR runs","the back flip to beat short third man. Disdainful. Shaped to play the lap shot over short fine, saw the length ball angle away and then flicked it up and over short third man"
17.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, no run","full, wide and just inside the wide line this time. Pant reaches out to beat point but can't lay bat to it"
17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, 2 runs","full toss, smacked towards deep cover where Shakib throws in a dive to cut that off"
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, FOUR runs","goes over cover, belts. Beats long-off. Once again looks to outfox him by bowling this wide and out of Pant's reach, this time he was ready for it."
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, 1 wide","angles it full and wide, Pant can't reach out. Wide called, however. Bhuvi is frustrated at that call, asks the umpire furiously why he called it a wide. Correct call, I have to say"
17.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, SIX runs","tournament's best bowler: take that. Pant has walloped this length ball into the change rooms at deep midwicket. Clean, clean strike. Superb picking of length, hit the middle of the bat. Sailed away. Wow"
16.6,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, no run",caught in a tangle as he looks to work that googly. Spun back in sharply to hit the thigh pad
16.5,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, no run","leading edge to backward point, loud call of noooooooooo from Maxwell"
16.4,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, 2 runs","cleverly works this down to long on, they hare back for the second. Very risky, you have to say. Thankfully a positive response from Pant"
16.3,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run",works this with the spin to deep square leg
16.2,"Rashid Khan to Pant, SIX runs","high and super handsome. Rashid goes full and Pant was waiting for it, muscled over the bowler's head, deep into the long-off boundary. This is some hitting."
16.1,"Rashid Khan to Pant, FOUR runs","the reverse sweep, this is a fierce hit that beats the diving deep point fielder. Changed his stance, bat grip much before the ball was delivered. This was a wrong'un so it helped him hit with the spin"
15.6,"Kaul to Pant, 1 run","looks to wallop this over deep midwicket, gets a thick inside edge and can only get it as far as square leg"
15.5,"Kaul to Pant, no run","another excellent yorker-length ball angling away, Pant can't get any bat as he looks to carve this behind square"
15.4,"Kaul to Pant, no run","slips in a yorker-length delivery across Pant, who can't reach out to squeeze this awa"
15.3,"Kaul to Maxwell, 1 run","angles in a length ball on middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket"
15.2,"Kaul to Pant, 1 run","flat-bats this over the bowler's head, on the bounce to Rashid at long off. This was a slower delivery"
15.1,"Kaul to Pant, SIX runs",width and Pant tees off like a golfer. Swung away wide of long-on. Another meaty blow.
14.6,"Shakib to Pant, 1 run",belts this full toss down to Rashid at long-on
14.5,"Shakib to Pant, no run","appeal for lbw as Pant misses a heave, this was sliding down leg."
14.4,"Shakib to Pant, FOUR runs","in his hitting arc, Pant shimmies down the pitch and belts this to the long-on boundary. Flat hit, angry stroke. He's taking out all the anger on the ball now."
14.3,"Shakib to Maxwell, 1 run",punches this length delivery to sweeper cover
14.2,"Shakib to Pant, 1 run",pulled but straight to deep square leg
14.1,"Shakib to Pant, SIX runs","muscled deep into the stands at midwicket. Fetches the slog from way outside off, clean strike. Brings up his seventh IPL half-century"
13.6,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run, OUT"," comedy of errors.  Another mix-up with Rishabh Pant. Harshal Patel is three quarters of the way down the pitch for the second, but the throw from deep midwicket is fumbled by Shreevats, but he recovers quickly to get to the ball and then comes up with an underarm flick to beat Harshal's dive. Surely someone's got to have a word with Pant about his running, very very poor.  Fourth time now that Pant is involved in a run out this season. He's run his partner out on three of those occasions"
13.5,"Rashid Khan to Pant, no run","beaten! Picked the googly, looked to run it down but is beaten by sharp turn"
13.4,"Rashid Khan to Patel, 1 run","works this with the spin to long-on, was the googly this time."

12.6,"Sandeep to Patel, 1 run","belted over the bowler's head, down to long-on."
12.5,"Sandeep to Pant, 1 run","punches this to cover, a misfield gives them a run.  Brings up the half-century stand off just 31 balls "
12.4,"Sandeep to Pant, FOUR runs","too much leg side, so Pant tickles this past short fine. Easy pickings. Today, he hasn't been about the muscle or the big hits, there's been a lot of calculative strokes."
12.3,"Sandeep to Patel, 1 run",punches this length ball to deep cover point
12.2,"Sandeep to Patel, SIX runs","he's deposited this into the second tier at long-on. Too short, tripe delivery. Clean swing as Harshal muscled this away."
12.1,"Sandeep to Patel, no run",mistimes a slap to cover
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Pant, FOUR runs","too short and down leg, Pant picks the length, rocks back and helps it along the way to the deep fine leg boundary."
11.5,"Rashid Khan to Patel, 1 run","shortish delivery on middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket"
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run","leading edge wide of cover, was looking to work this through midwicket"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Pant, FOUR runs","this time he paddles it past short fine leg. Went across a long way, looked to hit it to square leg but got an inside edge. Result doesn't matter. Pant's back hand came off the grip as well."
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Pant, FOUR runs","brings out the reverse paddle, beats short third man. Nicely executed. Rashid pushed this through so there was pace on it, Pant got on top of it nicely and used the pace."
11.1,"Rashid Khan to Patel, 1 run",steps out and squeezes this drive behind point for a quick single
10.6,"Kaul to Patel, 1 run","slips in a yorker that has been flicked nicely into the gap at deep square. Big mix-up again between Pant and Harshal, but he's managed to turn back in time at the non-striker's end"
10.5,"Kaul to Pant, 1 run",dabs this gently into the off side for a quick single
10.4,"Kaul to Pant, FOUR runs","short and sliding in, Pant swivels back and wallops this pull to the fine leg boundary"
10.3,"Kaul to Patel, 1 run",drills this full delivery down to long on
10.2,"Kaul to Patel, SIX runs","this is a ferocious pull. No matter how spiteful the surface is, if you bowl half-trackers like those, you will be put away. Harshal fetches this from outside off and imperiously pulls over the deep square leg fence"
10.1,"Kaul to Pant, 1 run","slower and fuller delivery that angles in, Pant dabs this into the off side for a quick single"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Patel, no run","he had no clue about that, went for a drive with hard hands, beaten as this spun sway sharply."
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run",swept from middle and leg to deep square leg

8.1,"Shakib to Pant, 1 run","short and sliding into middle and leg, worked behind square as they jog the single"
7.6,"Sandeep to Pant, 1 run",works this from middle and leg towards midwicket
7.5,"Sandeep to Pant, no run","slower length ball on off, punched to cover"
7.4,"Sandeep to Pant, OUT"," another ball, another inside edge  and Pant is involved in a run out again. This rolled just wide of the keeper, Iyer was more than halfway down the pitch when he had to turn back. By that time, Goswami had lobbed the ball to Sandeep, who broke the bails at the bowler's end."
7.3,"Sandeep to Pant, no run",knuckleball that cuts back in to take the inside edge onto the pad as Pant looks to go off side. There's plenty of grip on this surface for the slower ones
7.2,"Sandeep to Pant, no run","comprehensively beaten by a slower one. Committed into a forceful drive on the up, by the time he tried to pull out, this had beaten the inside edge"

5.6,"Kaul to Pant, 1 run",dabs this gently into the off side for a quick single
5.5,"Kaul to Pant, 2 runs",toe-ends a lofted it but this just eludes the two fielders running backwards from cover and mid-off. Slower delivery but Pant had to reach out to this delivery.
5.4,"Kaul to Pant, no run","much fuller this time, Pant gets a good stride in and defends to cover"
5.3,"Kaul to Pant, FOUR runs","bottom edge, beats the keeper to the third man boundary. Looked to blast this short ball through point. Lucky runs, but he'll take those."
5.2,"Kaul to Pant, FOUR runs","this time he pierces the gap between cover point and point. Once again length angling away, Pant uses the hint of width and then uses his wrists to pick the gap. Lovely."
5.1,"Kaul to Pant, FOUR runs",width outside off and he slaps this length ball to extra cover. First sign of width and he walloped that away

4.1,"Sandeep to Iyer, no run","back of length delivery on off stump, defended solidly."
3.6,"Shakib to Roy, OUT","stunning ball, super grab. Dream ball for any left-arm spinner. Drifted in, drew the batsman forward but spun away sharply from off stump to take the nick through to the keeper. Roy didn't even wait for the umpire's decision."
3.5,"Shakib to Shaw, OUT","the slowness of the surface has resulted in Prithvi's downfall. This is a touch short but stooped on him, Prithvi rocks back to pull and is through with the stroke early, only manages a top-edge that is gobbled up nicely by Dhawan at cover."
3.4,"Shakib to Shaw, no run",swept fiercely but straight to square leg
3.3,"Shakib to Shaw, FOUR runs","steps out, doesn't get to the pitch but goes through and manages to absolutely blast this wide of Shakib. Mid-on had no chance"

1.3,"Sandeep to Roy, no run","shortens his length this time, Roy stands tall and punches to point"
1.2,"Sandeep to Roy, FOUR runs","thumped on the up, to the left of extra cover. It was in the air for a while, but so well struck and just wide of the diving fielder. So good to see"
1.1,"Sandeep to Shaw, 1 run","floats it full outside off, Shaw mistimes an off drive to long on. Thick inside edge on that"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Roy, no run","inswinger from Bhuvneshwar, on a good length, Roy flicks and falls over. He wears it on the pad but this is heading down the leg side. Sharp first over from Bhuvneshwar"

0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, no run","fuller than a good length and swings back in sharply from over the wicket, Shaw is tucked up for room and an inside edge saves him"
18.1,"Krunal to Kuldeep, OUT","and Krunal seals it, but Kuldeep reviews it. A reverse sweep from Kuldeep for the ball pitching on middle and leg stump and it's going pretty straight from around the wicket, goes under the bat, hits him in front of the stumps and it's all over"

16.5,"Krunal to Tom Curran, OUT","there comes the wicket, holes out to long on. Not quite long on, actually, because Duminy had to run in and towards his right a fair bit after Curran came down and skied it high"

13.6,"Cutting to Tom Curran, 1 run","almost another run out! Curran helped that ball to backward point and there was another confusion - he went for the single, Kuldeep didn't want it and the ball just missed the stumps as Curran was making it back but was miles outside"
13.5,"Cutting to Chawla, OUT","slogs it straight to SKY (Suryakumar Yadav) at wide long on, his second catch to add to Lynn's run out. Looked like a slower ball again, it was fullish on leg, and Chawla slogged it high on the leg side, easy catch in the deep"

11.1,"Cutting to Chawla, no run",around the off stump and Chawla pushes it into the covers
10.6,"Bumrah to Tom Curran, no run","pace and bounce towards the middle stump, Curran respects it by blocking it back"

10.4,"Bumrah to Chawla, no run",waits for the short of length ball and steers it from off stump to point
10.3,"Bumrah to Chawla, no run","right on the off stump, Chawla blocks it back"
10.2,"Bumrah to Singh, OUT","edged to the keeper, KKR collapsing on their home ground against seam bowling. Bumrah leaps in celebration and why shouldn't he. That one pitched around the leg stump and Bumrah angled it nicely to absolutely stifle the batsman with the line and he only tickled it to the keeper"
10.1,"Bumrah to Singh, FOUR runs",short ball angled across and Rinku Singh waits for it to rise and then ramps it over the slip fielder for a well-placed four
9.6,"Pandya to Tom Curran, FOUR runs",inside edge runs away to the fine leg boundary. Curran pushed at it with hard hands outside off but played the wrong line and the thin edge beat Kishan to the fence
9.5,"Pandya to Tom Curran, no run",stays in the crease this time and pushes it down to mid on
9.4,"Pandya to Tom Curran, no run",swing and a miss outside off this time
9.3,"Pandya to Singh, 1 run",angled across and he guides it towards third man dangerously past first slip
9.2,"Pandya to Rana, OUT","holes out to deep midwicket, Cutting takes a superb catch running to his right. What's happening here! A short ball from Hardik, Rana pulled and that hardly went any distance beyond the 30-yard circle, Cutting wasn't at the boundary but well inside and he did well to run a few yards to his right and slide to catch that"
9.1,"Pandya to Rana, OUT","another run-out chance, Hardik may not have collected the ball here! Rana steered the ball to point and DK wanted the single, he hared out and turned back too. Oh hello, that's so so close. Hardik's right hand is in front of the stumps as the throw comes in and looks like the hand has broken the stumps as it comes back to collect the ball. But the ball is just touching the hand as the zing bails light up. Umpire Dharamsena gives it out!"
8.6,"Markande to Karthik, FOUR runs","swept against the turn from the meat of the bat and that reaches the boundary before a fielder an blink. Not that full, but DK swivels his bat with that loop and smashes it"
8.5,"Markande to Rana, 1 run",reverse sweep this time and he gloves it fine for one
8.4,"Markande to Rana, SIX runs","well over midwicket on this big ground! Another short ball to Rana, like the first one, and Rana went down on his knee quickly to pull that over the fielder's head in the deep"

8.2,"Markande to Karthik, no run","chips the ball back with the turn, lands a bit short of the bowler"
8.1,"Markande to Rana, 1 run",goes down on a knee and swat-sweeps it behind square for one
7.6,"Pandya to Russell, OUT","straight to cover! A slower one outside off, Russell wants to pounce on it and makes room to slap it on the off side. He does that but hands it straight to Markande who grabs it with both hands over his head"
7.5,"Pandya to Russell, no run","135.9kmh, ducks for the short ball and takes it on the shoulder. Hardik banged it in short and maybe Russell picked the length a bit late and ducked late and took his eyes off the ball while ducking"
7.4,"Pandya to Rana, 1 run",punches that uppishly towards mid off and that reaches the fielder after a couple of bounces
7.3,"Pandya to Russell, 1 run",another offcutter and Russell pulls but connects well enough only for one
7.2,"Pandya to Rana, 1 run",back of length offcutter and Rana scythes it to deep point where Lewis does well to keep it to one
7.1,"Pandya to Rana, no run",fullish on the off stump and Rana drives it down to mid off
6.6,"Markande to Rana, 1 run","wrong'un to end the over, but it was short enough to be spotted by Rana and he pulled it to deep midwicket"
6.5,"Markande to Russell, 1 run",off the mark straightaway by punching that through the covers
6.4,"Markande to Uthappa, OUT","straight to deep midwicket! Suryakumar had to move only an inch to his right because Uthappa made some room, Markande pitched it on the leg stump and Uthappa slog-swept it straight to the fielder"
6.3,"Markande to Rana, 1 run",on the leg side and Rana helps it away easily to deep square leg

5.5,"Pandya to Rana, no run",waits for the ball around off stump and defends to point
5.4,"Pandya to Rana, no run",slightly straighter and he pushes it towards cover point
5.3,"Pandya to Rana, FOUR runs","how delicate was that and so well placed. A short offcutter from Hardik, Rana spots it and lets it come to him to tap it late with short hands and places it between the keeper and the fine gully fielder"
5.2,"Pandya to Rana, no run","around the off stump off back of length, Rana defends it late and behind square on off"
5.1,"Pandya to Rana, FOUR runs","starts on the pads, Rana is strong on that side and he clips it away nicely to roll it along the ground past short fine leg"
4.6,"Bumrah to Uthappa, no run","nearly plays on! Strong finish from Bumrah to end the over with one that angles in, Uthappa gets an inside edge that nearly gets the off stump"
4.5,"Bumrah to Uthappa, no run","beats the outside edge! Length delivery outside off that just about holds its line after coming in with the angle, Uthappa pokes and misses"
4.4,"Bumrah to Uthappa, SIX runs","bangs it in short and Uthappa pulls that away stylishly for six! Watched the ball land well outside off, turned on the back foot and swivelled nicely to pull it square"

4.1,"Bumrah to Rana, no run",swings it across Rana on the off side who drives and misses
3.6,"Krunal to Uthappa, OUT","oh, mix up and Lynn is nowhere close! Uthappa sliced the ball to cover point and took a step or two out of the crease but Lynn reacted late and suddenly ran down the pitch but it was too late. Suryakumar swooped in and sent it a flat throw to Krunal well before Lynn could reach the crease"
3.5,"Krunal to Uthappa, SIX runs","goes across the line with a heave and he connects enough to go over long on. It wasn't a bad ball, on length on off and he swiped it to the leg side"
3.4,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run",goes back to pivot on the back foot and tucks the ball to mid on
3.3,"Krunal to Lynn, 1 run","comes down the track this time and Krunal pulls the length back a bit, a single towards cover"

3.1,"Krunal to Lynn, no run","right on the stumps on length, blocked back to the bowler"
2.6,"McClenaghan to Lynn, 1 run","slightly slower than average again, on the stumps this time. No room at all so Lynn makes some and chops it with hard hands to deep point"
2.5,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run","slower delivery on back of length outside off, he waits and then steers it to backward point"
2.4,"McClenaghan to Lynn, FOUR runs","fine leg is in, a short ball again and this time Lynn uses placement instead of power to pull it wide and square of short fine leg"
2.3,"McClenaghan to Lynn, SIX runs","smoked this time! Another short ball, another pull and he connects this time and how! From the meat of the bat and it sailed to the midwicket boundary"
2.2,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run","that goes a bit high and behind the stumps, Kishan runs forward and dives desperately but it falls well short of him. Took a bit of glove when Lynn tried to pull the short ball"
2.1,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run","sees a short ball outside off and slaps it to cover, lands short of the fielder"
1.6,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run",he goes back in the crease to let the ball turn and then helps it to short third man
1.5,"Krunal to Lynn, 1 run",too short outside off and he goes back to punch through cover. Rohit slides to his left and fumbles a bit

1.3,"Krunal to Uthappa, 1 run",goes back and tucks it to the leg side successfully this time
1.2,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","stays back in the crease to turn the ball from well outside off to leg, but doesn't connect"
1.1,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","he tries to sweep across the line, takes it on the pad and the appeal is turned down. Probably going down leg"
0.6,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run",pushes this one with a straight bat straight to cover. Dot ball to end the over
0.5,"McClenaghan to Lynn, FOUR runs","short ball, it's a slower one and Lynn waits after that high back lift, and then pulls it late for it to go fine on the leg side this time, four more"
0.4,"McClenaghan to Lynn, FOUR runs","big edge, flies down to third man for a one-bounce four! Sees room outside off with that fullish length and he swings hard, gets an edge thick enough fine on the off side"
0.3,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run",he angles it across from length and Lynn reaches out for it to drive but gets an inside edge to the leg side
0.2,"McClenaghan to Narine, OUT","short ball follows and mid-on takes it easily! Right on the money, Mitch! Bangs it in short, Narine opens up a bit and pulls for a top-edge that goes high and Krunal comes under it comfortably"
0.1,"McClenaghan to Narine, FOUR runs",over mid-off first ball for four! Not sure why that happened but Mitch bowled it straight and full on the off stump for Narine to loft that over a leaping mid-off for four
19.6,"Chawla to Krunal, SIX runs","pulled, and pulled very very well. What a flourish, what a finish. Sitting up nicely as Krunal muscled this over deep midwicket.  KKR will have to bat out of their skins to get this.  22 off the last over, not the finish they wanted."
19.5,"Chawla to Cutting, OUT","drags this from outside off, so there's no timing on this heave and DreRuss takes a superb catch with the boundary triangle just around the corner of his eyes. Took three steps to his right, maintained his balance and took it without much fuss."
19.4,"Chawla to Cutting, no run","swung through early, missed. Hit on the back"
19.3,"Chawla to Cutting, FOUR runs","clobbered! This time on the bounce, bisects deep midwicket and long-on. He went length, got punished."
19.2,"Chawla to Cutting, SIX runs","too short, vanishes over deep midwicket. Stayed firm and muscled this away. DK's a worried man already"
19.1,"Chawla to Cutting, SIX runs","in his hitting arc and this has vanished over wide long-on. Drifted in from wide of the crease, Cutting was waiting for it as he teed off like a golfer in style"
18.6,"Prasidh to Krunal, 2 runs",walks across and whips this full delivery towards fine leg. Russell took a while to run in and pick up
18.5,"Prasidh to Cutting, 1 run",drills this full delivery to long off
18.4,"Prasidh to Cutting, no run","Swing and a miss. Little more effort into the delivery, bounce as well. Cutting once again looked to pull from outside off"
18.4,"Prasidh to Cutting, 1 wide","slips this short and outside the wide line, Cutting leaves."
18.3,"Prasidh to Cutting, SIX runs","too much power, too much muscle. Slower length ball way outside off, Cutting picked it early, walked across, held his shape and belted this over wide long-on"
18.2,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, OUT",toe-ends a lofted hit straight to mid-off.  First IPL wicket for Prasidh  and a slower delivery has earned him one. His one-time Karnataka team-mate takes the catch.
18.1,"Prasidh to Cutting, 1 run",muscles the short ball in front of square to deep midwicket
17.6,"Tom Curran to Pandya, OUT","another full toss, surely a no-ball? They've asked for the ball back. Straight to long-on. Replays suggest this was just below the waist. Hardik has to go but he's done his job."
17.5,"Tom Curran to Pandya, SIX runs","carved over square third man. Too much width, another full toss and he got down on it nicely to hit this up and over. One-handed slice"

17.3,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 1 run",drills this full delivery on the bounce to long off

17.2,"Tom Curran to Pandya, no run","toe-ends a paddle, can't get it up and over"
17.1,"Tom Curran to Pandya, SIX runs","walloped! Length outside off, Hardik held his shape and deposited that slower delivery over the deep midwicket boundary"
16.6,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, no run","the back cut, straight to Nitish Rana at point. Cry of anguish from Rohit, a meter to his right and it was four"
16.5,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","slogged, don't worry about the line. Way over deep midwicket. Walked across the stumps to negate the width, and muscled it away"
16.4,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","rocks back to cut, down to deep cover"
16.3,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, no run","chops a cut, DK runs across to stop. Swift work"

16.1,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",swept from outside off to deep square
15.6,"Tom Curran to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","back of length on middle and leg, works this to square leg."
15.5,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 1 run","lofted but off a thick inside edge, down to long on"
15.5,"Tom Curran to Rohit Sharma, (no ball) 1 run","backs away and forces this length ball wide of cover.  Oh, dear. Has he overstepped? Freehit  This is a ridiculous call for no-ball, clearly had half a foot  behind the line.  KN Ananthapadmanabhan  is the umpire. Curran and KKR have seen it on the big screen and have asked for the decision to be overturned, but the umpires can't do that according to the rule book. This is ridiculous.  Michael Clarke on air calls this a disgrace "
15.4,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 1 run"," run out missed!  Back of length on off, slaps this to cover and scampers a run. Hardik had given up, a direct hit by Chawla at the bowler's end and he would've been running back to the dugout."
15.3,"Tom Curran to Pandya, no run","backs away to go over cover but Kishan slips in a yorker, squeezed back"
15.2,"Tom Curran to Pandya, no run","legcutter outside off, steers this straight to point. Good work by Rana at point"
15.1,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 2 runs","hops back and bunts this down to square third man, excellent running, wayward Narine throw."
14.6,"Narine to Pandya, 1 run","too full and drifting in, eased to long on"
14.5,"Narine to Pandya, no run",turns this gently into the leg side
14.4,"Narine to Ishan, OUT","swept again but this time he's picked out Uthappa right at the ropes at deep square leg. So, so close to being a seventh six. Sensational knock, one that has given them a kick towards the death overs. Kishan is bitterly disappointed but he can be mighty proud of his efforts."
14.3,"Narine to Ishan, SIX runs","where has he hit this? Don't worry, deep into the stands at deep midwicket. Down on one knee, underneath the flight as he picks the bones out of the slog sweep. The perfect swing, a golfer's delight. This is some batting, right out of the top drawer."
14.2,"Narine to Ishan, no run",swing and a miss. Narine carefully drifted this across. Kishan heaved wildly
14.1,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",punches this length ball to deep point
13.6,"Kuldeep to Ishan, SIX runs",walks across the stumps and uses his wrists to whip this full delivery over deep midwicket. Stunning. Countered the drift with his wrist work and bottom handed power.  Shades of MS Dhoni and his helicopter shot 
13.5,"Kuldeep to Ishan, SIX runs","steps out and flat-bats this over long on to bring up a 17-ball fifty. Joint-fastest for Mumbai Indians. Stunning innings, the captain applauds and then gives him a bear hug"
13.4,"Kuldeep to Ishan, SIX runs","belted across the line, slogged and it clears deep midwicket with ease. This wasn't easy because he had to fetch it from way outside off. Huuuuuuuge"
13.3,"Kuldeep to Ishan, SIX runs","swept high and handsome, way over deep square leg. He saw Kishan stepping out so fired it in, he went down on his knee instead to bring out the sweep. Got it off the middle. Wow"
13.2,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","turns back in from length on middle and leg, worked to deep square"
13.1,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","googly, picks it off the hand, drives inside-out to cover"
12.6,"Prasidh to Ishan, FOUR runs","slower length ball, Kishan hops across and pulls over short fine. Sweet! Excellent match awareness, signs of knowing the field inside-out"
12.5,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",thick inside edge to deep square. Looked to flay this on the up
12.4,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","pulled in front of square, didn't get hold of it but there's still enough fizz to split the gap between deep square and wide long on."
12.3,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","bottom edge, but this races fine to the third man boundary. He was looking to cut"
12.2,"Prasidh to Ishan, 1 run",backs away and slaps this to point. Didn't quite get the width he would've liked.
12.1,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",dabs this down to third man
11.6,"Russell to Ishan, FOUR runs","clean, crisp strike. Fearless, ferocious. Kishan is on a roll. Too full and angling away, he's down on one knee as he absolutely belts this inside-out to beat sweeper cover."
11.5,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slower and fuller on middle and leg, worked wide of midwicket"
11.4,"Russell to Ishan, 1 run","was shaping up to heave, ends up dabbing it gently into the off side instead"
11.3,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run"," Rana puts down a straightforward offering at backward point!  The timing of his jump was off. Went with his palms facing upwards, and rightly so, but fluffed it. Rohit saw the width and looked to go over cover, sliced it and survives."
11.2,"Russell to Ishan, 1 run","squeezes this yorker-length ball back, Russell can't stop it cleanly"
11.2,"Russell to Ishan, 1 wide",skiddy bouncer but way over Kishan's head as he looks to swivel back and pull. Beaten.
11.1,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",uses the depth of the crease to ease this down to third man
11.1,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide", .and starts with a wayward delivery down leg. Wide
10.6,"Chawla to Ishan, FOUR runs","pulled but he splits deep square leg and fine leg. Got the impression that he didn't time it well, but was perfectly into the gap. Spun away on the practice turfs. Big over!"
10.5,"Chawla to Ishan, 2 runs",works this length ball from outside off towards square leg. The closest fielder - short fine leg - took a while to get there
10.4,"Chawla to Ishan, FOUR runs","swept besides short fine. Too flat, too quick and Kishan picked that away superbly."
10.3,"Chawla to Ishan, no run","fires this length ball at 116kph on middle, bunted to point"
10.2,"Chawla to Ishan, no run","beaten on the pull, the short ball drifted away and would've missed off stump. KKR have reviewed! Umpire's original decision stays and  KKR lose a review  Pitched miles outside leg as well."
10.1,"Chawla to Ishan, FOUR runs",the reverse sweep over short third man. Picked the wrong'un so he was hitting this with the spin. Very clever
9.6,"Kuldeep to Ishan, 1 run",steps out and drills this down to long on
9.5,"Kuldeep to Ishan, SIX runs","uses his feet, and sent over wide long on! Used all his muscle to tonk that. Didn't get to the pitch but that didn't matter"
9.4,"Kuldeep to Ishan, no run","through his defenses! Full outside off, and it's the one that goes straight through. Kishan tried to defend it towards cover, but he played for the wrong'un"
9.3,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","just over Kuldeep's outstretched hands! Drifted into middle stump, and Rohit drives too early. The ball holds off the pitch, and Rohit pushes it straight back. In the air, but just over the bowler's left hand. Close!"
9.2,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","full on middle, and he's down on one knee to sweep it behind square. Deep backward square cleans up"
9.1,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","flighted full outside off, and driven well to cover. Straight to the man though. That could've been the breakout shot"
8.6,"Chawla to Yadav, OUT",pulled straight to Rinku at deep midwicket. He didn't have to move an inch. This isn't a magic ball. Right there for the pull but Surya didn't get any power or timing behind that. Surya has thrown away a strong start.
8.5,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",works this from outside off towards midwicket
8.4,"Chawla to Yadav, 1 bye","goes for a mighty heave, misses. Wasn't far from off stump. Lost shape, bottom hand came off the bat handle. This was a googly too."
8.3,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slow turn from length on off, dabbed towards point"
8.2,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, no run","skids through from length, Rohit gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
8.1,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, no run","drifts in full from wide of the crease, turns this to midwicket"

7.5,"Kuldeep to Yadav, no run","reads the googly, cuts late but straight to point"
7.4,"Kuldeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","gets across and sweeps this fiercely to the fine leg boundary. Too much flighted, drifted and spun back in to make it easy."
7.3,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 2 runs","waits, waits and then drills this tossed up delivery to long off where Prasidh misfields to give away a second"

7.1,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 1 run",goes back and flat-bats this length ball to long on

6.3,"Narine to Yadav, 1 bye","shapes to play the late cut, misses. DK fumbles and they scoot a bye"

5.6,"Chawla to Yadav, no run",punches this straight to Curran at cover point
5.5,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",works this against the line to midwicket
5.4,"Chawla to Lewis, OUT"," what a strange way to go.  This was a loose delivery, a half-tracker on middle and leg, the ball took ages to get to Lewis, who was already through with the pull. The ball looped off the back of the bat after it hit the thigh and then to short third man. The missed opportunity doesn't cost KKR much."
5.3,"Chawla to Yadav, 1 run","inside edges a drive off the pad to cover, quick single pinched"
5.2,"Chawla to Yadav, FOUR runs","too full outside off, Surya gets to the pitch and belts this over cover. Sparkling stuff. Enters the 400+ club this season with that"
5.1,"Chawla to Yadav, FOUR runs",starts with a full toss and Surya says fetch that! Pulled to beat deep backward square leg. Fierce sweep
4.6,"Prasidh to Lewis, 2 runs"," dropped by Kuldeep running back from square leg!  Prasidh beat Lewis for pace, took him on with the pull and got it high on the bat. Lucky to get away. Lewis was hustled and in no position to play that in front of square. Prasidh's first IPL wicket will have to wait"
4.5,"Prasidh to Lewis, no run","lovely shape away to beat the edge. Bounce, pace and carry. He's regularly bowling around the 140 mark"
4.4,"Prasidh to Lewis, FOUR runs","backs away and slaps this over point. Wanted to go over cover, lost his shape but ended up slicing it up and over. He'll take the runs"
4.3,"Prasidh to Yadav, 1 run",stubs this down to square third man where Russell puts out a superb dive to stop. Saved three runs
4.2,"Prasidh to Yadav, no run","too close to the stumps at length, once again steers this straight to slip. Surya looking to be too cute here."
4.1,"Prasidh to Yadav, no run",dabs this length ball to slip. Tried to pick the gap between keeper and slip. Brave
3.6,"Narine to Lewis, FOUR runs","splits the gap, beats cover, beats Russell at long-off. Something about his effort suggested he didn't go full tilt, but I think even a fitter Russell would've struggled. So well timed. Too short and it was belted away."
3.5,"Narine to Lewis, no run","touch short, he goes back and bunts this to cover"
3.4,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run",works this length ball down to long on
3.3,"Narine to Yadav, no run","full, spins back in from off stump, defended back"

2.3,"Tom Curran to Lewis, 1 run",squeezes this square drive to Narine at square third man. Just raced to him
2.2,"Tom Curran to Lewis, FOUR runs",sees this in his half and belts this over cover. Almost as if Lewis had decided he'd just look to blast this. Not quite to the pitch but he swung this through nicely.
2.1,"Tom Curran to Lewis, no run", squared up to beat the outside edge.  Lovely delivery first up. Moved away from length
1.6,"Prasidh to Yadav, SIX runs","sliced over backward point, sails over the ropes. Not much wrong with the length, quite full but Surya had enough width to throw his bat at that."
1.5,"Prasidh to Yadav, no run","once again, good bounce off the deck. Gets bounce as Surya is hit high on the bat as he defends. Lovely from Prasidh"

0.3,"Russell to Yadav, no run",opens the face to steer this length ball on off to Rinku at point
0.2,"Russell to Yadav, no run","short of length delivery that shapes away from off, Surya is on top of the bounce as he defends"
0.1,"Russell to Yadav, no run","full and swinging away from outside off, beaten as he looks to squeeze behind point"
19.6,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR runs","Rahul ends on 95! An unbeaten, but valiant knock. It was short on off, and Rahul once again reverse paddles this over short third man. Ends the game with a 16-run over, but it was all too late. Rajasthan Royals win by 15 runs!"
19.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR runs","full outside off, and he shuffles across to the off side before reverse sweeping over short third man! Settles down on one knee, and sent over the infield"
19.4,"Unadkat to Rahul, no run","dropped by Unadkat! That's hurt his arm. It was the slower ball, on a good length, that he tried to muscle towards leg side. Took the toe end of the bat and came to Unadkat rather slowly, but he was expecting it to come quicker. Hits his wrist"
19.3,"Unadkat to Rahul, SIX runs","full outside off, and Rahul backs away before thumping it over deep extra cover! His highest score in the IPL!"
19.3,"Unadkat to Rahul, (no ball)","waist-high full toss way outside off, and the ball hits Rahul's shoulder. Tried to paddle it over his shoulder once again, but this time it didn't come off the bat. Ouch. Free hit as well"
19.2,"Unadkat to Tye, 1 run","slower ball, full on off stump. Driven down the ground to long on"
19.1,"Unadkat to Stoinis, OUT","full toss outside off, and slapped over cover point. Gowtham's at deep point, and his jumping effort is good enough! The ball sticks in his hand, and that's quite an extravagant celebration. Puts his ball in the pocket and folds both arms in the deep."
18.6,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","deja vu! It's outside off, and Rahul once again shuffles towards that side before paddling it over short fine leg again. Does well to get his head out of the ball's way before playing it over his left shoulder. Kings XI need 32 off the final over"
18.5,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","smart! Planned for the yorker this time, and moved to the off side even Archer bowled. It was a yorker, of course, and Rahul does a Marillier over short fine leg!"
18.4,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","too much movement from the batsman, but still manages to clear mid off. It was slow outside off, and he walked across to the off side before checking his movement. Was in an uncomfortable position, but still manages to lift it over mid off"
18.3,"Archer to Rahul, 2 runs","another yorker on leg stump, of course. Dug away towards midwicket, and no one's there in the deep. Archer has to go racing behind it, and does well to keep it down to only two"
18.2,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","yorker just outside off, and dug away towards cover for a walking single"
18.1,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run",walks across to the off side and paddles it over short fine leg. Does well to get his head out of the ball's way
17.6,"Unadkat to Stoinis, no run","ends another over with a yorker! Just outside off, and the batsman can't put it away. Just misses the bat's under edge, and goes through to the keeper"
17.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","goes for the wide yorker outside off, and the reverse sweep does not come off. He did get bat to ball, but the shot comes off the bat's back. Trickles down to point"
17.4,"Unadkat to Stoinis, 1 run","the cutter again, and this time it's short outside off. Mistimes this slapshot to cover, and Anureet stops the ball with a one-handed slider! Excellent commitment in the field"
17.3,"Unadkat to Stoinis, 2 runs","change up, and short on off stump. Stoinis backs away to make some room, and bunts it over Unadkat's head. Some work for long off, but he does well to keep it down to two"
17.2,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","wide outside off, and even a full toss. But Rahul misses out. His slap towards point comes off the bat's toe end. Lucky Unadkat"
17.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR runs","back of a length, but wide outside off. Rahul can't wait no more as he walks down the ground and meets this cutter from near his chest. Pulled into the gap between wide long on and deep midwicket"
16.6,"Archer to Stoinis, no run","ends with another yorker. Straight at middle stump, and Stoinis does well to get bat to ball. Mistimed to backward point"
16.5,"Archer to Stoinis, no run",too slow! And short as well! Stoinis has no clue when the ball would get to him. Completed deceived as he tries to swipe at it. Just 95kph
16.4,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","another yorker on off, and dug away to mid off. They want the quick single though, and it could be dangerous! But the fielder misses the direct hit. Rahane the man at mid off"
16.3,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run",full outside leg stump once again. Successfully pre-empts Stoinis' movement to the leg side. Can only squeeze the yorker away to mid on
16.2,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","full outside leg, expecting the batsman to back away. Aimed at his toes, and all he can do is clip it towards deep midwicket"
16.1,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","back of a length on middle, but angling into the batsman. He backs away, and muscles it towards deep midwicket"
15.6,"Unadkat to Stoinis, 1 run","change up again. On middle stump, and comfortably flicked off his pads to square leg"
15.5,"Unadkat to Stoinis, no run","slower ball, but outside off stump. Big wind up from Stoinis, but he's through his cut shot too early. Mistimed to cover point. Stoinis is disappointed to have missed out"
15.4,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","width offered outside off, and cut hard behind square. Man at deep backward point manning that region"
15.3,"Unadkat to Stoinis, 1 run","toe-ends it! Full on off, and Stoinis comes charging down the ground. Tries to drive towards cover, but takes the edge to short third man"

15.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, 2 runs","good length on off, and whipped off his pads to the midwicket region. Calls nice and early for the second run, and therefore completes it in a flash"

13.4,"Anureet to Stoinis, no run","back of a length on top of off, punched back to Anureet"
13.3,"Anureet to Axar Patel, 1 run, OUT","full and wide, dragged off the inside half to wide long-on. Another slower ball, Axar can't manufacture his own pace and he risks a second. He is late, and eventually dishes out a full-length dive. Binny throws it to the keeper, who takes the bails off. Is the bat on the line? Or is there some part behind the line? No conclusive evidence. Tight call for the TV umpire. Bardue rules Axar out. Excellent throw from Binny: right on top of the stumps"
13.2,"Anureet to Axar Patel, FOUR runs","110.8ks, back of a length and outside off, Axar reads the change-up and smears it away to the midwicket boundary"

11.6,"Stokes to Tiwary, OUT","Rahane dives forward to snag the catch and send Tiwary back. 143kph, good length on off and but the ball sticks in the surface. Tiwary closes the face early and lobs a catch to cover off a leading edge"

8.6,"Sodhi to Nath, OUT","Sodhi has Shane Warne applauding from the Royals dug out. Tossed up and breaks away outside off, Nath clears his front leg and looks to mow it over midwicket against the turn. He can only send a leading edge to long-off. The asking rate has shot to 10.36"

7.2,"Lomror to Nath, 2 runs","back of a length on off, but angling into his body. Worked off his pads to wide long on, and enough time for Nath to come for the second run"

6.1,"Sodhi to Nath, no run","bat-pad, or pad-bat?! Full on off, and zipping straight through. The batsman tries to defend, and hits his pad first, perhaps. Sodhi wants to review. Interesting.

5.6,"Stokes to Rahul, no run","low full toss outside off, mistimed to cover, and Rahul's halfway down the wicket. The fielder picks up and has a shy at the striker's end, but misses completely. Direct hit and the batsman would've been gone! Rahul choosing to live dangerously"

5.4,"Stokes to Rahul, no run","full just outside off, and meets the drive on the full. Finds the man patrolling the cover region though"
5.3,"Stokes to Rahul, no run","full on middle and leg, and Rahul tries to drive towards mid on. Takes the leading edge towards mid off instead"

5.1,"Stokes to Rahul, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off,  and Rahul reaches at it to slap it over point. The ball was past the tramlines anyway, so he had to stretch slightly more"

3.5,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and cut smarly to cover point. Misfield, however, and that's what allows him to take the single"
3.4,"Archer to Nair, OUT","short on off, and Karun goes for a wild swing. Pulls it towards the leg side, but slices it instead. In the air for ages, and Unadkat at long on needs to compose himself. Takes it well before crashing to the ground!"

2.2,"Gowtham to Ashwin, OUT","two-ball duck! Perfect offspin from Gowtham, and that crashes into leg stump. It was outside off, but wild turn into the batsman. Tries a big heave towards the leg side, but the ball sneaks through the big gap between bat and body"

2.1,"Gowtham to Gayle, 1 wide, OUT","stumped! Down the leg side. It was full on leg stump, and Gayle came charging down the wicket. The ball angles down leg, and Buttler's excellent behind the stumps. Quick to remove the bails, CHG has to go!"
1.6,"Archer to Rahul, SIX runs","slapped over point! Short outside off, and Rahul slashes this hard and away from his body. Top edged, but still goes to the point boundary. Archer's pace hurts his own bowling"
1.5,"Archer to Rahul, 2 runs","full on off, and Rahul makes some room this time. Lifts it over the infield, and although the bat turned in his hand, the shot had enough power to clear the infield. Binny goes chasing after it"
1.4,"Archer to Rahul, no run","back of a length, and outside off again. Too close to Rahul for any off-side shot. Taps it towards cover point with the bat's open face"

19.6,"Tye to Unadkat, OUT","Holes out to Karun Nair at long-on. Very full on off, another knuckle ball, Unadkat ends up skewing it to Nair at long-on. Tye is now the top wicket-taker in IPL 2018 with 16 wickets"

11.4,"Ashwin to Samson, no run","tries something new, but doesn't come off! It was fuller outside off, and Samson shuffled across to the off side to paddle it fine down the leg side. Doesn't come off"
11.3,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","good length outside off again, and spinning away from Buttler once more. Opens his bat's face and plays it towards cover point. Gap there to exploit"
11.2,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","good length outside off again, and spinning away from Samson. He stays on the back foot, and whips it off his pads to the midwicket region"
11.1,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","good length on off, but it's the legbreak! Tentatively pushed off the back foot towards cover"
10.6,"Axar Patel to Samson, 2 runs","another misfield! Add another free run to Royals' total. It was just outside off, and Samson played a delicate late cut to short third man. Mujeeb the guilty man"
10.5,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 1 run","fuller outside off, and defended with soft hands towards cover. Calls early for the run, and completes it with ease"
10.4,"Axar Patel to Buttler, FOUR runs","poor from Tye! What should've been two, has now gone for four. It was punched hard off the back foot past cover, but Tye can't stop it at wide long off"
10.3,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 2 runs","short on middle, and going down the leg side. Buttler whips it off his pads to deep midwicket. Played gently enough, and that allows him to take the second run"

10.1,"Axar Patel to Buttler, no run","good length on off, and gripping & turning away from Buttler. Stays on the back foot and pushed to cover"

9.5,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","good length outside off, and punched to cover. No run this time"
9.4,"Mujeeb to Buttler, FOUR runs","loose! And punished. Good length, but outside leg stump. Buttler mistimes this fine down the leg side, while trying to drag it towards the leg side. Beats short fine leg!"
9.3,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 2 runs","good length outside off, and punched off the back foot. Deep extra cover, Mohit Sharma, puts in a sliding effort"
9.2,"Mujeeb to Samson, 1 run","good length outside off, but spinning into his body. Opens his bat's face and cuts it late. Enough time to sneak the single"
9.1,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and easily thumped down the ground to long off for a walking single. You'd think Buttler would be happy to get off strike"
8.6,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 1 run","good length on off, and the ball comes into Buttler's body. Smacked down the ground to long off for one, and that's a very tidy over from Axar."

8.2,"Axar Patel to Buttler, no run","straightens after pitching! Beautiful. Full on off, and Buttler tried to defend it straight. Played down the wrong line as the ball turns across his bat. Sharply collected by KL"

7.6,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","full on middle, and going straight through. Driven past the non-striker to long on. He'll keep strike"

7.4,"Ashwin to Samson, no run","it's the legbreak! Good length outside off, but turning away from Samson. He tried to defend it towards cover, but completely misread the turn. Well taken by the keeper"
7.3,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","flighted on middle, and turning into him. Flicked off his pads to short fine leg, and there's his fifty! Third in a row for Jos"

6.3,"Stoinis to Gowtham, OUT","muscled to long on! The experiment fails. Full outside off, and he tries to send it into orbit. Got his front leg out of the way to connect with it, but the lack of pace does Gowtham in. Played too early, and easy for Tiwary in the deep"
6.2,"Stoinis to Gowtham, no run","back of a length outside off, and he tries to cut it late! Almost chops it onto his stumps, clearly deceived by the change up from Stoinis. Was too close to his body for that shot anyway"
6.1,"Stoinis to Buttler, 1 run","back of a length on off, and comfortably clipped off his pads to the man at deep midwicket. They jog across"

5.1,"Tye to Buttler, no run","back of a length and outside off, slower one, the batsman delays his punch and hits it to cover"
4.6,"Sharma to Gowtham, SIX runs",pitched up and outside off - right in Gowtham's swinging arc - he launches it right over the bowler's head. Dismissive. The ball lands in Royal's dug out. And he holds his pose like a boss

3.5,"Tye to Buttler, 1 run","back of a length on off, jabbed to point"
3.4,"Tye to Rahane, OUT","Tye hoodwinks Rahane with the change-up! Knuckle ball, short and sticks in the pitch, Rahane does not pick the variation. He forays down the track and looks to ping it over the leg side. Instead, he skies a leading edge to extra cover"

19.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Grandhomme, OUT",and their season goes out the window. RCB all but out of the tournament. De Grandhomme walks across a long way and tries to whip it but the yorkers  angles into him and sneaks from underneath the bat to smash the stumps
19.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Mandeep, 1 leg bye",advances down the ground and gets hit on the pad as he tries to heave it away to the leg side. Rolls into the off side off the pad
19.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Grandhomme, 1 run","yorker, angled into his leg-stump, and all de Grandhomme can do is squeeze it out to long-on. They can't even attempt the second. Top work all around"

19.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Mandeep, 2 runs",tries the yorker again and ends up firing a low full toss that's whipped to the right of long-on. They take on the fielder to for a brisk second

18.6,"Kaul to Grandhomme, 1 run",squeezes a yorker to point

18.3,"Kaul to Mandeep, 1 run","thick inside edge to the keeper, but de Grandhomme risks the run and hares across. Saha's underarm flick hits the striker's end direct but he's in."
18.2,"Kaul to Mandeep, 2 runs","shot and wide outside off, Mandeep slaps this to sweeper cover. Rashid almost over-ran the ball there, but somehow manged to recover and fire the throw"

17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Grandhomme, FOUR runs","thick outside edge, streaky but he'll take the runs. Too full on off, he looked to dive but got the edge that squeezed between keeper and short third man."
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Grandhomme, no run",looks to flay this legcutter but is beaten. Too close for comfort
17.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Mandeep, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, eased to third man"
16.6,"Rashid Khan to Grandhomme, no run",didn't pick this properly but somehow managed to get this back to the bowler. Sharp leggie there
16.6,"Rashid Khan to Grandhomme, 1 wide","googly that cuts back in to beat the thigh pad. Wide called, extra run"
16.5,"Rashid Khan to Grandhomme, no run","sees the flight, looks to slog again but lost his shape. In doing so, the backfoot was up in the air Smart grab from Saha, and he whips the bails off, but was the foot plonked back? Difficult decision for the third umpire. Just grounded I reckon. Very close"
16.4,"Rashid Khan to Grandhomme, no run","swing and a miss. Looked to go over long on, missed."
16.3,"Rashid Khan to Grandhomme, SIX runs","goes again, clears deep midwicket again! Didn't quite get to the pitch of the ball, picked the googly and went through with it from outside off. Dhawan was quite a long way in. May have been in a better position to catch if he was at the ropes."
16.2,"Rashid Khan to Grandhomme, SIX runs","he's muscled this over deep midwicket! You beauty! Stunning stroke. Length outside off, he just thumped it. Too much muscle, hit the triangles on the full"

14.6,"Sandeep to Mandeep, FOUR runs","pulled, and pulled well. A tumble at deep midwicket but Sid Kaul can't stop that. Boundary. Should've been no more than two"
14.5,"Sandeep to Mandeep, no run","leading edge but lands short of Sandeep. He looked to work this to the leg side, closed the bat face early."
14.4,"Sandeep to Grandhomme, 1 run","toe-ends a whip to the keeper, did it take the pad? No, umpire seems to signal it was off the bat. A very thin edge if ever there was"

12.2,"Sandeep to Grandhomme, 1 run","whips this uppishly towards square leg, Dhawan grabs this on the bounce. De Grandhomme would've been anxious"

11.6,"Kaul to Grandhomme, 1 run",turns this length ball to square leg to get off the mark
11.5,"Kaul to Grandhomme, no run","this is a sensational delivery! Tails in late to hit CDG flush on his toe. Such a comprehensive appeal resonated by 40,000 fans in the ground. But SRH don't have a review! Good call from umpire Virender Sharma, though. Missing leg stump."
11.4,"Kaul to Ali, OUT","he's feathered an edge and RCB are on a freefall. Not the right length to pull, looked to fetch from outside off, and just got the bottom edge. The umpire didn't give it initially but raised his finger as he saw Moeen walking. Moeen's maiden IPL outing with the bat is a forgettable one!"
11.3,"Kaul to Ali, no run","shapes to pull, misses. Wasn't far from his gloves. Skiddy bouncer from Kaul"
11.2,"Kaul to Ali, no run",solidly defended off the backfoot
11.1,"Kaul to Ali, FOUR runs",nearly chopped on! This one just shaves past off stump and beats the keeper to the fine leg boundary
10.6,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, no run",right to the pitch as he smothers this googly
10.5,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, no run",fizzing legbreak that beats Mandeep's tentative forward push. It's all happening in Uppal!
10.4,"Rashid Khan to AB, OUT"," back-to-back wrong'uns  and AB's gone. Picks the googly, but too close for the cut. This keeps a touch low as AB chops on! RCB in real trouble"

10.2,"Rashid Khan to Ali, 1 run","sharp turn back in, cuts this towards point"
10.1,"Rashid Khan to Ali, FOUR runs",flays this to get a thick outside edge that beats short third man. Streaky but he'll take it. Don't think he picked the wrong'un
9.6,"Shakib to Ali, 1 run","steps out and whips this over the infield to deep midwicket, Moeen off the mark."
9.5,"Shakib to Kohli, OUT","leading edge and the catch has been taken by Yusuf at short third man. He's taken it one-handed! For a while it looked like Yusuf lost it completely, thinks its going over, eventually sticks his right hand out to pluck that. Kohli shaped to pull but was cramped for room and the ball looped up. Big strike, the match is alive!"

8.5,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","chops a cut to point, quick single"
8.5,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 wide","there's absolutely no spike on it, but Saha's brilliance down leg has made this look ridiculously easy. AB walks across to pull this short ball sliding in, and in doing so, missed the pull. Wide called.  Not out stays that way . SRH lose a review"
8.4,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, 1 run",dabs this gently into the off side for a quick single
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, no run",lunges forward and defends back
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, FOUR runs", dropped at slip!  Is that the game? Williamson lets this go through his hands. This was a thick outside edge as Kohli jabbed at this. What's worse? It races away to the third man boundary
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, no run","back of length on off, punched to cover"
7.6,"Sandeep to AB, no run","has that been dropped? Might have dropped just in front. Seems like this one just stuck into the pitch. De Villiers chips this length ball straight back, and Sandeep dives forward but there's no catch taken"

7.2,"Sandeep to AB, 1 run",turns it away towards square leg
7.1,"Sandeep to Vohra, OUT","oh, he's chopped it on. So the drop doesn't prove as costly. A legsidish slower ball, 113ks, just back of a length. Vohra doesn't pick the drop in pace and tries to whip forcefully.

6.6,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, no run","a bit of spin away from him, Kohli moves across and blocks"
6.5,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, 2 runs","slides it into middle and leg, and Kohli whips it away through midwicket for a brace"
6.4,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, no run","short of a length, tries to whip it away and gets hit on the high part of the bat"
6.3,"Rashid Khan to Vohra, 1 run",dropped. Rashid dropped this short and it sat up for Vohra who didn't entirely get hold of his pull. Kaul at deep midwicket goes at it reverse-cupped after getting around it but lets it pop out

5.1,"Kaul to Kohli, FOUR runs",advances down the ground and heaves this after meeting the pitch through midwicket. Rashid sprints to his left from deep square leg but is a tad late in putting in the dive
4.6,"Shakib to Kohli, 1 run","fullish length, slid in on middle and leg, drilled away to mid-on"
4.5,"Shakib to Kohli, FOUR runs","too close to cut, and he shuffled across as well, and that results in an outside edge that runs away to third man. Expensive over"
4.4,"Shakib to Kohli, SIX runs","down the track, right to the pitch, and smoked over long-on. Overcompensation from Shakib as he flights it up too much"
4.3,"Shakib to Kohli, FOUR runs","short of a length, Kohli stays back and just jab it through deep midwicket with a full-blooded pull"

3.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Kohli, 1 run",hangs back in the crease and opens the face of his bat to third man
3.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Kohli, FOUR runs",that's a spectacular shot. Brilliantly punched through cover. That's all timing and placement and poise. Just presents the full face of his bat to a back of a length delivery
3.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Kohli, no run","short of good length outside off, Kohli walks across and drills towards mid-on off the inside part of the bat"
2.6,"Shakib to Kohli, 1 run","full, slid in on middle and leg, clipped away through midwicket"
2.5,"Shakib to Patel, OUT","that looks close and it's been given. Parthiv looks at his partner and then walks off, so review not taken. Might have been umpire's call, so perhaps a good decision to not review. Parthiv misses the sweep as this length ball spins in and pins him dead in front of middle"
2.4,"Shakib to Patel, FOUR runs","fullish on middle and leg, now he clears mid-on with a simple, clean swing"
2.3,"Shakib to Patel, FOUR runs","leg-side fuller ball, too easy for Parthiv as he gets down on the back knee and sweeps it through deep square leg. The fielder is stationed slightly backward and he can't get around it"

0.4,"Sandeep to Vohra, 2 runs","fuller ball, barely lofts it over the bowler off the toe-end of the bat, mid-on runs back to gather it"
0.3,"Sandeep to Patel, 1 run","length ball on middle and leg, tucked away to the left of mid-on"
0.2,"Sandeep to Patel, no run","short of good length around off, stands tall and punches to short cover"
0.1,"Sandeep to Vohra, 1 run","short of a length outside off, rides the bounce and drops it in front of backward point"
0.1,"Sandeep to Vohra, 1 wide",length ball that drifts down the leg side and gets past the batsman's attempted tuck
19.6,"Southee to Sandeep, OUT","tries to reverse this length ball, but misses. The ball angles in from wide of the crease to hit him on the back leg. Looks like he's hit in line. Ball tracker confirms this would've smashed into off stump. The on-field decision was not out, so the decision has now been overturned.  SRH bowled out."
19.5,"Southee to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run, OUT","pulled to deep midwicket, but no timing or power. They turned for the second blindly, Kaul seems confident of having made his ground, but Kohli thinks its out. Looks like he's comfortably gone. Good gather from Parthiv."
19.4,"Southee to Bhuvneshwar, no run","full and straight on the stumps, kept out."
19.3,"Southee to Kaul, 1 run",squeezes this full delivery down to long on
19.2,"Southee to Rashid Khan, 1 run, OUT","mistimes a pull to midwicket, brain fade from Bhuvi as he turned for the second, Rashid was never going to get there. Kohli coming in from deepmidwicket had to watch out for the late spin, he collected the ball on the bounce and fired an accurate throw to Parthiv who did the rest"
19.1,"Southee to Rashid Khan, no run",steps out to pull but is beaten
18.6,"Siraj to Saha, OUT","trying to be too ambitious! This is a 146kph delivery that has cleaned up Saha's stumps. Full and angling in, he tries to ramp, misses and the off and middle stump take a knock."
18.5,"Siraj to Saha, 2 runs",gets across the stumps and whips this to deep square. He was initially looking to scoop this fine
18.4,"Siraj to Saha, no run","backs away to play the upper cut, but is beaten for pace"
18.3,"Siraj to Saha, SIX runs",in the slot and bang! Backed away to free his arms and loft it over mid-off. Clean
18.2,"Siraj to Rashid Khan, 1 leg bye","pacy delivery, swing and a miss. Deflects off the pad to the off side, leg bye"
18.1,"Siraj to Pathan, OUT",flattens leg stump. Yusuf looks for an ambitious hoick but is beaten for pace. Maybe he was expecting a slower ball.
17.6,"Southee to Pathan, 1 run","short-arm jab, picked the bones out of that but straight to deep square leg"
17.5,"Southee to Pathan, FOUR runs","even finer! Goes with the pull, gets a top-edge over the keeper's head. Poor from Southee. Too short again"
17.4,"Southee to Pathan, FOUR runs","helped over short fine. Too short, too much down leg. Easy"
17.3,"Southee to Saha, 1 leg bye","through with the pull too early, hits the shoulder and rolls to the keeper, they scamper a leg bye"
17.2,"Southee to Shakib, OUT","slower length ball, Shakib gets across and sweeps this straight to Umesh at backward square leg. Big wicket under the circumstances. Made him fetch this, because he changed the pace, this bounced that much more to hit the top part of the bat to deny him the power to clear the infield."
17.1,"Southee to Pathan, 1 run",pulled on the bounce to deep midwicket
16.6,"Siraj to Pathan, 1 run","thick inside edge onto the pad as he shapes to drive, rolls to cover for a quick single"
16.5,"Siraj to Shakib, 1 run","slower ball, Shakib steps out and slaps this to long off"
16.4,"Siraj to Shakib, FOUR runs","this was so, so close to the base middle. Shakib exposed all three stumps as he went across and paddled it wide of short fine leg. Brave"
16.3,"Siraj to Shakib, no run","slower length ball, slapped to cover"
16.2,"Siraj to Shakib, FOUR runs","picks the gap. Fetches the pull from outside off, split the gap between square leg and short fine"
16.1,"Siraj to Pathan, 1 run","skiddy length ball angling in, hops across to tuck this square for a single"
15.6,"Yadav to Williamson, OUT","walks across and tries to heave it over. Had to fetch it from way outside off and playing from that far outside, it's always hard to middle anything. Skews it to the man at the deep backward square leg boundary. Umesh almost oversteps"
15.5,"Yadav to Shakib, 1 run","short, pitches around leg stump, swivels and pulls to deep fine leg"
15.4,"Yadav to Williamson, 1 run",this time he pulls this into the leg side and they take a single
15.3,"Yadav to Williamson, FOUR runs","slower full ball, carved away over extra cover. Effortless"
15.2,"Yadav to Shakib, 1 run","back of a length, angling across off, looks to pull away to midwicket but ends up knocking it to the right of deep third man, where Vohra makes a diving save"
15.1,"Yadav to Shakib, no run",too close to cut as Shakib misses and the ball goes over the outside edge

14.4,"Chahal to Shakib, 1 run","flat length ball on middle and leg, swept behind square leg"
14.3,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run",pushes this fuller one out to sweeper cover. And that's a fifth half-century for Williamson this IPL
14.2,"Chahal to Williamson, SIX runs","floated up outside off, meets the pitch with a big stride across and slogs it against the spin from outside off. Clean over deep midwicket. Top shot"
14.1,"Chahal to Shakib, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket"
13.6,"Yadav to Williamson, SIX runs","oh, dear! Another relatively high full toss. He's just lucky that wasn't over waist-height or this over could have yet become worse. Heaved away off the hips over backward square leg"
13.6,"Yadav to Williamson, 1 wide",too full and drifting down the leg side
13.5,"Yadav to Williamson, 2 runs","good length outside off, stands tall and punches past extra cover but mid-off, who is slightly back, gets around it"
13.4,"Yadav to Williamson, FOUR runs","leg-side length ball, poor line, helped along with the angle to deep fine leg"
13.3,"Yadav to Williamson, no run","back of a length outside off, stays leg side of it and shovels it to mid-off"

12.6,"Siraj to Shakib, 1 run","was that too high? Deemed to be fine by the umpire but very close to being a no-ball. A high full toss, nudged towards short midwicket off the inside part as it doesn't come on"
12.5,"Siraj to Shakib, no run",advances down the ground and swipes across the line with the ball angled across him
12.4,"Siraj to Shakib, no run","fullish length around middle and off, punches to the left of the bowler who fumbles as he tries to stop. Shakib wants a single but is sent back"
12.4,"Siraj to Shakib, 1 wide","short, pitches outside leg stump, and it's way too high"
12.3,"Siraj to Shakib, no run","short, angles away and gets big, tries to get on top and slashes at it but the bounce is too steep"
12.2,"Siraj to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, backs away as it angles into him and steers through point"
12.1,"Siraj to Shakib, 1 run","length ball around off, drops it into the off side"
11.6,"Grandhomme to Shakib, 1 run","short and wide, another cut that finds deep point"
11.6,"Grandhomme to Shakib, 1 wide","sprays it horribly down the leg side and Parthiv, standing up to him, does well to dive to his right and stop it"
11.5,"Grandhomme to Shakib, no run","slower ball, just back of a length, mistimes his push back to the bowler"
11.4,"Grandhomme to Williamson, 1 run","back of a length, angling in on off, punched to extra cover"
11.3,"Grandhomme to Shakib, 1 run","too short and too wide, luckily for him, Shakib finds deep point with his cut"
11.2,"Grandhomme to Shakib, no run",
11.1,"Grandhomme to Shakib, FOUR runs","short around off, RCB keep bowling there and it's going to release a lot of the pressure they've built up, flayed through backward point"
10.6,"Chahal to Williamson, no run","walks across and pummels this short of a length delivery straight back at Chahal, who gets a hand and half-stops it. Recovers and gets to the ball quickly to make sure it's a dot"
10.6,"Chahal to Williamson, (no ball)","short, wide, moves across and crunches a cut to cover. And he has overstepped"
10.5,"Chahal to Shakib, 1 run","length ball, spinning in on middle and leg, helped along to fine leg"
10.4,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","length ball, spins away on off, shuffles across and whips it to midwicket"
10.3,"Chahal to Williamson, no run","that's much better. That's beautifully done, in fact. Draws him right forward by floating it up but makes sure to take it away from his off-stump, causing him to stretch forward and lose balance. Parthiv takes the bails off. Has Williamson slid the foot back in? Yes, he has"
10.2,"Chahal to Williamson, FOUR runs","too short again, Chahal isn't finding the right lengths tonight, Williamson swivels and rolls his wrists over a pull through midwicket"

9.4,"Ali to Shakib, no run","back of a length, straightens around off, backs away and cuts to cover"

8.4,"Chahal to Shakib, no run","floated up on middle and leg, clipped away to the leg side"
8.3,"Chahal to Shakib, 2 runs","spins in from a back of a length, opens up and cuts to the third man region"
8.2,"Chahal to Pandey, OUT","ah, that's tame. Chips a length ball straight into the hands of short cover. They go upstairs to check the front foot, and he seems to have done alright there. Chahal gave it just about enough loop and landed it around middle, Pandey cleared the front leg and simply gave Kohli some catching practice"
8.1,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","short, swivels and pulls to deep midwicket"
7.6,"Ali to Pandey, 2 runs",uppish but just wide of square leg. Excellent running to come back for the second
7.5,"Ali to Williamson, 1 run","too short, he pulls to deep square"
7.4,"Ali to Williamson, no run","spins back in to beat his tickle, rolls wide of Parthiv who hares across to stop"

6.3,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","hint of width, driven through the line to deep cover"
6.2,"Chahal to Williamson, no run",steps out and then lunges a little more to defend that back
6.1,"Chahal to Pandey, 1 run","tossed up on off, eased to long off"
5.6,"Siraj to Williamson, no run",gets on top of the bounce and punches to point
5.5,"Siraj to S Dhawan, OUT"," pulled straight to Southee at fine leg!  This was an effort ball from Siraj, Dhawan picked the length early and swivelled to pull, but he was looking to clear the long boundary, didn't get it off the middle. The local boy has given RCB a reason to cheer"
5.4,"Siraj to S Dhawan, no run","right into the blockhole, squeezed to Moeen at cover"
5.3,"Siraj to S Dhawan, no run",beaten as he looks to slash this one! Too close to play that
5.2,"Siraj to Williamson, 1 run","angling a length ball into middle and leg, whipped to deep square"

4.6,"Southee to S Dhawan, 1 run","turns this off his hip to midwicket, another quick single"
4.5,"Southee to Williamson, 1 run",whips this length ball from outside off to square leg. There's a direct hit at the bowler's end from Umesh but Williamson is in
4.4,"Southee to Williamson, 2 runs","angles into middle and leg, whipped into the gap at deep midwicket. Super running"
4.3,"Southee to Williamson, FOUR runs","slower and fuller outside off, KW gets to the pitch of the ball and  creams this between cover and mid off. "

4.1,"Southee to Williamson, 1 run","back of length on off, punched to mid off"

3.6,"Yadav to Williamson, 1 run","full and close to the stumps again, eased down to mid on"
3.5,"Yadav to S Dhawan, 1 run","charges down the pitch but sees Umesh shorten his length, just taps it gently into the off side and scampers a run"

3.3,"Yadav to Williamson, no run","this one keeps a touch low as he hops back to defend this length ball, rolls back"

2.5,"Southee to Williamson, 1 run","slower length ball, punched to square third man"
2.4,"Southee to Williamson, FOUR runs","gift of a delivery first up. Too full, drifting into the pads. Was he searching for late swing? There was none here and Williamson tickled it to the fine leg fence to get off the mark"
2.3,"Southee to Hales, OUT"," Cleaned up,  the middle stump has been flattened! This is a top, top delivery. Angles in a cross-seam delivery length from wide of the crease, this may have nipped away ever-so-slightly as Hales looked to play across the line. Missed it to see the stumps pegged back."
2.2,"Southee to S Dhawan, 1 run",steps out but mistimes this pull from outside off to deep square
2.1,"Southee to S Dhawan, no run",driven firmly but straight to extra cover
1.6,"Yadav to Hales, FOUR runs","the extra ball, a cruel one too, has been lofted through the line over mid off. Length on off, Hales went through to clear the infield"
1.5,"Yadav to S Dhawan, 1 run",drives this low full toss straight to mid off
1.4,"Yadav to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","thumps this short delivery to the midwicket fence. Too short, Dhawan picked the length and pulled it in front of square"
1.4,"Yadav to S Dhawan, 1 wide","yorker-length on the pads, Dhawan overbalanced as he misses. Poor call from umpire Virender Sharma. Flicked the pad."
1.3,"Yadav to S Dhawan, no run","squared up by a length ball that nips away slightly from middle, Dhawan's right shoulder is visible to the bowler as he defends"
1.2,"Yadav to S Dhawan, no run",driven on the up but straight to Vohra at cover point. Not much room to drive
1.1,"Yadav to S Dhawan, no run","slants a length ball across Dhawan, who defends to the off side"
0.6,"Ali to S Dhawan, 1 run",pulled away but there's protection at deep square. Good first over from Moeen
0.5,"Ali to S Dhawan, no run","slides one back in towards middle and off, defended to short cover"
0.4,"Ali to Hales, 1 leg bye","shaped to play a slog sweep, lobbed off the pad to short fine leg. Moeen got away with that"

18.4,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","that's the win! Low full toss and he smashes it through to the extra cover boundary and celebrates with a fist-pump! The Holkar Stadium is roaring. They've been chanting his name all through the death overs but now it's an incoherent scream of joy. The home team has won, and it's on the back of a sensational innings."
18.3,"Archer to Rahul, 2 runs","another two! Rahul expects the slower ball, he holds his shape, nudges it to the left of deep square leg and catches the fielder dozing"
18.2,"Archer to Rahul, SIX runs",what a strike! He stares down a 147 kph length ball and smacks it straight down the ground. Absolute class!
18.1,"Archer to Rahul, 2 runs","targets the blockhole again, but Rahul clears his front leg and smears it to long-off. The crowd is going bonkers. They scream ""Ra-hul! Ra-hul! Ra-hul!"
17.6,"Unadkat to Stoinis, no run","slower ball on middle, Stoinis blocks"
17.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, Rahul comes out of his crease to try and nudge it through midwicket but ends up getting a leading edge through cover. Highest IPL score for Rahul"
17.4,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR runs",around the wicket and it doesn't work! It just doesn't work! Rahul is batting on another level. He sees the length earlier than he should. He can only see the gaps. And so his backing away and cutting the ball between point and short third man is academic really
17.3,"Unadkat to Rahul, SIX runs","shifts over the wicket and is sent over the fence at long leg! Rahul has been starving himself of runs just so that he can feast in the death! All through the middle overs he's been dabbing the ball for singles and twos. And now, at the pointy end, he's swivelling on the back foot and pulling short balls to oblivion"
17.2,"Unadkat to Rahul, 2 runs","full and outside off, Rahul slams it to deep cover and they pinch a couple again. This is super work from Kings XI, assuming Stoinis has stretched far enough to make his ground at the non-strikers. And he has. This is a small ground, people, and these guys are absolutely stealing doubles."
17.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, 2 runs",backs away and carves a 118 kph back of a length delivery on off stump to the sweeper cover
16.6,"Archer to Stoinis, 2 runs",works it right in between midwicket and long-on on the boundary and that placement earns him a second run.
16.5,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","yorker again, at 146 kph, Rahul digs it out to cover and wants a new bat. Some serious heat on these deliveries"
16.4,"Archer to Rahul, SIX runs","upper cut to the fifty! Indore is screaming his name and he responds with one of the shots of the match. The pressure is mounting, he has chosen to ignore it expressly so he can bat through the innings. Now he sees a bouncer outside off, he senses a chance to get under it and ramp it over the boundary"
16.3,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","nails the yorker this time at 145 kph, Stoinis jams a straight bat down to find a single at long-off"
16.2,"Archer to Stoinis, FOUR runs",that's a timely strike! The bowler searches for the blockhole and overpitches. The batsman stands perfectly still and laces it through the covers.
16.1,"Archer to Stoinis, 2 runs",flicks the back of a length delivery at 110 kph to deep square leg. Good hustle to get a couple
15.6,"Stokes to Stoinis, 1 run","another slower ball, looping up and dipping in towards the base of off stump. Stoinis winds up but gets another inside edge to short fine leg"

15.4,"Stokes to Rahul, 2 runs",walks out of his crease and whips a full delivery from outside off to the right of long-on
15.3,"Stokes to Rahul, 2 runs","sweet drive through point, leaning on his front leg, getting close to the good length ball outside off and treating it exactly as he would in a Test match."
15.2,"Stokes to Stoinis, 1 run","looks for the blockhole at 140 kph, Stoinis clears his front leg and inside edges his slog to square leg"
15.1,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","short ball at 114 kph, Rahul pulls it to deep square leg"
14.6,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","full and outside off, Rahul drives to deep cover"
14.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, no run","insists he has taken the catch and Samson might just have turned the game with a one-handed stunner! The on-field officials take it to the third umpire, but the soft signal is not out. First replays indicate the ball might just have touched the turf before Samson scoops it up. So Rahul can heave a sigh of relief and think about improving on that cut shot. He did make room to try and get the gap to the left of point. And almost managed it too."
14.4,"Unadkat to Stoinis, 1 run",direct hit would have had Stoinis! Rahane at extra cover has one stump to aim at. And only misses it by a clump of whiskers! Another slower ball from Unadkat throws up great action
14.3,"Unadkat to Stoinis, no run","goes around the wicket for a pitched-up offcutter which Stoinis defends, careful not to be sucked into playing the angle and popping a leading edge"
14.2,"Unadkat to Stoinis, FOUR runs","flies past the keeper! These offcutters are getting some purchase tonight, enough to have Stoinis playing a loose shot, the bat reaching in front of his body, the feet going nowhere. A thick edge results, Buttler dives full-length to his right, but he has no chance"
14.1,"Unadkat to Stoinis, no run","back of a length on off stump, Stoinis blocks with an open face"
14.1,"Unadkat to Stoinis, 1 wide","he wants to keep from giving Stoinis room, but in that effort, he bowls short and down leg and is wided"
13.6,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, straightening from middle, Stoinis whips it to mid-on"
13.5,"Gopal to Stoinis, SIX runs",that's easy. Flights up a length ball with ample room. Stoinis has his nose under it as he pummels it straight over
13.4,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","Stoinis sees the shorter length and tries to cut but with no room available, gets beaten"
13.3,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","floated up and turning away slightly outside off, Stoinis shuffles and keeps the bat inside the line"
13.2,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","takes it away from his off-stump, and Rahul reaches out to drill it towards point"
13.1,"Gopal to Rahul, no run","pitches it up outside his off-stump, Rahul reaches out for a drive to extra cover"
12.6,"Gowtham to Stoinis, no run",shuffles across to a length ball and blocks
12.5,"Gowtham to Axar Patel, OUT","caught at the boundary! D'Arcy Short snaffles a smart catch at deep midwicket. A length ball around middle, Axar tries to loft it over the leg side but is done in by the lack of room.

11.4,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","back of a length on off, gets on top of it and punches down to long-on"
11.3,"Unadkat to Rahul, no run","length ball, beautifully done. Draws him forward and gets it to leave him off the deck very late as Rahul walks into the shot and gets beaten"
11.2,"Unadkat to Rahul, no run","short of a length outside off, opens the face to backward point"
11.1,"Unadkat to Axar Patel, 1 run",punched to mid-on for a quick single
10.6,"Anureet to Axar Patel, 1 run","length ball around middle, whips it away to deep square leg"
10.5,"Anureet to Nair, OUT","ah, bad ball to get out to. Karun tries to fetch a pull from way outside off and gets an under-edge onto the stumps. Timely strike for Royals, ends a burgeoning stand"
10.4,"Anureet to Nair, 2 runs","short of a length, lets it come on before tucking it to deep square leg. The fielders in the deep are at midwicket and backward square leg, and the batsmen push back for the second as they converge on the ball"
10.3,"Anureet to Nair, SIX runs","length ball, darted in on the pads, too easy for Karun, who picks it up off his pads and launches it over backward square leg"
10.2,"Anureet to Nair, 2 runs","full outside off, Rahul punchily slams it over the bowler's outstretched hand towards long-off"
10.1,"Anureet to Rahul, 1 run","fullish length on the fourth-stump channel, whipped away to the right of long-on"
9.6,"Gopal to Nair, no run","length ball that slides in with the arm around middle and leg, blocked off the backfoot to the left of the bowler"
9.5,"Gopal to Nair, SIX runs","oh, shot! Just steps out of his crease and he hasn't even got right to the pitch. But what he does is make sure to give himself enough room before launching it over extra cover with a free extension of the arms. Hits the boundary cushion on the full. Or has it? The TV umpire has multiple slow-mo replays to look at it. Eventually decides it's a six. Top shot"
9.4,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","flat, back of a length, shuffles across to meet the pitch before whipping it between long-on and deep midwicket"
9.3,"Gopal to Nair, 1 run","short of a length on middle and off, sitting up nicely for Rahul who pulls hard to deep midwicket"

8.6,"Anureet to Rahul, FOUR runs","that's some pristine placement. Short of a length outside off, Rahul waits and punches really late with an open bat face to beat backward point diving to his left"
8.5,"Anureet to Rahul, 2 runs","slower ball, short of a length, Rahul crunches a pull to deep backward square leg where Tripathi dives and nearly fumbles to push it away towards the boundary but recovers and does well to get a hand and pull it back"
8.4,"Anureet to Rahul, no run","short of good length on a fourth-stump channel, Rahul punches and finds cover"
8.3,"Anureet to Nair, 1 run","back of a length on off at 121.6 kmph, punched through the cover and point region"
8.2,"Anureet to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball at 117.1 kmph, drops it in front of cover and takes off for a rapid single, barely manages to beat the throw"
8.1,"Anureet to Rahul, no run",shuffles across early and chops his cut at this short delivery
7.6,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run",stands up tall against a shortish delivery outside off and knocks it down to long-on.
7.5,"Gopal to Nair, 1 run","full and outside off, drives to long-off"
7.4,"Gopal to Nair, no run","full and outside off, he drives to cover's left"
7.3,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","another pull shot, this time to the man at deep midwicket"
7.2,"Gopal to Rahul, FOUR runs",keeps going short - perhaps he's worried Rahul too would stride down the pitch - but the batsman is happily slinking back to pull to the square leg boundary
7.1,"Gopal to Nair, 1 run","leading edge but it finds its way through to long-off. Karun tries to come down the track, Gopal pulls his length back, the batsman plays against the turn, and what little comes off the pitch, produces a mis-hit"
6.6,"Stokes to Nair, 1 run",hangs back against the short ball on leg stump and pats it down to long-on
6.5,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","full and outside off, Rahul slices it to deep third man"
6.4,"Stokes to Nair, 1 run","shortish and outside off, Nair chops it down to third man"
6.3,"Stokes to Nair, no run","slower ball outside off and he thwacks it to short cover. Loads of sensational hitting tonight, most yielding no runs or wickets"
6.2,"Stokes to Nair, FOUR runs",nails the half-volley down the ground! In the slot on middle stump and Nair keeps the front leg away and presents the full face
6.1,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run",holds in the pitch does this 139 kph delivery and Rahul has to keep his shape a second longer so that he can crack the ball through to the sweeper cover
5.6,"Unadkat to Nair, no run",fullish and slow and outside off. Nair hits it to cover
5.5,"Unadkat to Nair, no run","slower ball, on and around off stump, Nair picks it up rather late, tries to punch it down the ground. Makes no contact as the ball flicks the top flap of the pad and goes through to the keeper"
5.4,"Unadkat to Nair, no run","looks for the gap past short fine leg with a pull shot, but can't find it"
5.3,"Unadkat to Nair, no run","good length on off stump, defends"
5.2,"Unadkat to Nair, no run",blocks the shortish delivery on off stump to point
5.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run",walks out to the medium-pacer and works the length ball off his pads through midwicket
4.6,"Stokes to Nair, FOUR runs","fumble by Gopal at third man, and so another beautiful delivery, pitched up, outside off yields a result the Royals don't like. Nair throws his hands at this too, gets a thick edge, and Gopal, running around on the edge of the boundary makes a mess"
4.5,"Stokes to Nair, no run","falls short of Rahane at second slip! Lovely delivery to the new batsman, hitting a good length, probing in the off-stump corridor. Nair pokes at it, gets an outside edge, but he's played with hands just about soft enough"
4.4,"Stokes to Agarwal, OUT","straight to long leg! And it's a rip-roaring shot too! Agarwal picks the short ball early, gets inside the line and tears the leather off it with a pull shot. But he forgets all about placement, which is just fine for Stokes, Tripathi and the Royals"
4.3,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","looks for the drive through cover, but he is into the shot too early and an inside edge takes it through midwicket"
4.2,"Stokes to Rahul, no run","shimmies over to off stump and gets a short ball at his hip. Fine leg is inside the circle, so the pull shot is on. Just doesn't connect well enough"
4.1,"Stokes to Agarwal, 1 run",pulls a short ball from just outside off and that lack of room means the ball ends up at mid-on
3.6,"Archer to Rahul, no run","144kph, waits for the good length ball on leg stump and turns it to square leg."
3.5,"Archer to Rahul, no run",gorgeous on-drive as he fronts a 149 kph delivery and hits it with a lot of class
3.4,"Archer to Rahul, 2 runs",taps it behind square leg and pinches a couple as well. Good work from Rahul. Plays with soft hands and had a partner who was willing to put in a little extra effort. Karnataka boys going well.
3.4,"Archer to Rahul, 1 wide","goes for the short one, but it goes way over Rahul's head, and down leg too."
3.3,"Archer to Agarwal, 1 run",gets up off his toes to pull the short ball away to long leg
3.2,"Archer to Gayle, OUT","aaarrrgghh, screams Gayle as he absolutely wallops a short and wide delivery straight to point! Kings XI have ridden on the openers' performance in this IPL. And this early wicket is going to test their middle order. Lucky breakthrough because this looked like it would have made a hole through the boundary boards and gone off to Mumbai"
3.1,"Archer to Gayle, FOUR runs","149 kph! And it's thrashed through extra cover! Archer slots it in the hitting arc for the big man, who clears his front leg and creams it through the gap"
2.6,"Gowtham to Rahul, no run",shapes to cut a quicker delivery outside off and hits it to point
2.5,"Gowtham to Rahul, no run",tosses it up wide outside off and Rahul drives to cover
2.4,"Gowtham to Rahul, FOUR runs",shuffles across on off stump and scoops it over short fine leg!
2.3,"Gowtham to Rahul, FOUR runs","reverse sweep, and it's done effortlessly. He knows Gowtham wil lbowl on leg stump. And that gives him a leg up. He knows a general area of where the ball will be, he knows third man is up, and he takes advantage"
2.3,"Gowtham to Rahul, 1 wide",attempts the sweep with Gowtham firing it down leg. Doesn't connect
2.2,"Gowtham to Rahul, no run",bounces over the stumps! Rahul tries to cut a ball that's way too full and gets a bottom edge. Buttler is in agony as he watches the ball bounce over leg stump
2.1,"Gowtham to Rahul, FOUR runs","he is ever so good! Even with the offspinner wants to cramp him for room, Rahul backs away and cuts a ball on leg stump to the point boundary"
1.6,"Archer to Gayle, no run","oooh, this is a battle! Archer's angle from around the wicket, and his line of attack, going short and at the body, is not fun for Gayle. He backs away and blocks this with his bottom hand flying off his bat"
1.5,"Archer to Gayle, FOUR runs",backs away and carves the 137 kph short ball to the point boundary. A shot that is meant to dictate terms.
1.4,"Archer to Gayle, no run","147.8 kph, short, a little wide, and it bounces over Gayle's cut shot. The big man is coming off second best"
1.3,"Archer to Gayle, no run","beats him with a peach! At 147 kph, this good length ball holds its line from around the wicket and try as Gayle might to block it, he simply cannot touch this"
1.2,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","another very good short ball, angling into the body and always rising up on the batsman. Rahul is in discomfort as he fends it away towards square leg."
1.1,"Archer to Rahul, no run",forces Rahul back with a shortish delivery on off stump. The batsman blocks it into the off side
0.6,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run","tries to slap a back of a length ball that affords him room through point, but the fielder dives to his right and saves a boundary"
0.5,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run","full on middle and leg, Gayle nudges it to a short leg that Royals have put in place. Rahane knows he needs wickets."
0.4,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run",fires it through on middle and leg and strikes Gayle on the pads. Big shout for lbw but it would have gone down leg
0.3,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run","opens the face as he guides a good length ball on off stump, with the turn, to point"
0.2,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run","cramps him with a full delivery on middle, from around the wicket, Gayle blocks it"
0.1,"Gowtham to Rahul, 1 run",a gentle clip to long-on against a good length ball outside off
19.6,"Tye to Unadkat, OUT","and a wicket seals what has been a top effort from Kings XI on the field. A slower ball again, and Unadkat holds no shape as he tries to pull. They try to steal a bye but a direct hit from Rahul catches Shreyas short of his ground"
19.5,"Tye to Gopal, 1 run","extremely full on leg stump, looks to reverse it and jams it out to point"
19.4,"Tye to Unadkat, 1 run",swivels and pulls a short one but deep backward square leg moves to his left and gets around it
19.3,"Tye to Gopal, 1 run",backs away to one that comes into him and tries to go over the in-field on the off side. Skewed off the outside of the bat and the ball lands in front of point moving to his right
19.2,"Tye to Gopal, no run","slower short ball, loses shape as he swings early on the pull and gets beaten"
19.1,"Tye to Unadkat, 1 run",full toss again. They're getting their yorker attempts all wrong here. Slammed down to long-off
18.6,"Rajpoot to Unadkat, 1 run","dipping full toss on the stumps, squeezed out to long-on"
18.5,"Rajpoot to Gopal, 1 run","full toss on off, swung away to long-on"
18.4,"Rajpoot to Gopal, FOUR runs","over short third man. Slower ball again, it's back of a length. Shreyas opens up and skews it over the fielder off a thick outside edge"
18.3,"Rajpoot to Gopal, FOUR runs","full around the fourth-stump channel, clears the front leg and carves it over the in-field to knock it a couple of bounces over the point boundary"
18.2,"Rajpoot to Gopal, no run",beaten by pace and lack of room as he stays put in the crease and swings
18.1,"Rajpoot to Unadkat, 1 run","short and wide, doesn't manage to get on top of it entirely as he slaps it to sweeper cover"
17.6,"Tye to Gopal, FOUR runs","dipping slower ball, a full toss that's been punched down the ground and beats long-on sprinting and diving to his left"
17.5,"Tye to Unadkat, 1 run","short of good length outside off, punched to sweeper cover for one"
17.4,"Tye to Gopal, 1 run","length ball, angled into him, backs away and tucks it through midwicket"
17.3,"Tye to Unadkat, 1 run","extremely full outside off, carved over the in-field to the right of sweeper cover who gets around it"
17.2,"Tye to Gopal, 1 run","slower dipping yorker, squeezed out through midwicket"
17.1,"Tye to Tripathi, OUT","slower full ball at 116.1ks outside off, not picked by Tripathi who presents the full face and just chips it in the air to offer an easy catch to mid-off"
16.6,"Axar Patel to Tripathi, 1 run","length ball on middle, punched to long-off"
16.5,"Axar Patel to Gopal, 1 run","full on middle and off, clipped off the pads to deep midwicket"
16.4,"Axar Patel to Tripathi, 1 run","back of a length, tucked away from middle to midwicket"
16.3,"Axar Patel to Gopal, 1 run",plants the front foot across for a sweep to deep fine leg
16.2,"Axar Patel to Gopal, no run",backs away to a short ball and cuts late to backward point
16.1,"Axar Patel to Gopal, 2 runs","length, curving into his stumps, punched away to the right of sweeper cover"
15.6,"Rajpoot to Tripathi, FOUR runs","short and wide, that's too much room, and Tripathi carves it away through the vacant third man region"
15.5,"Rajpoot to Tripathi, 2 runs","short outside off, gets on top of the bounce and punches it to deep point as he beats the fielder in the circle to his left"
15.4,"Rajpoot to Gopal, 1 run","back of a length, drifts into his pads, tucked to deep fine leg"
15.3,"Rajpoot to Gopal, 2 runs","short of good length, cuts in off the deck, and he backs away and drops it in front of short third man for a quick single"
15.2,"Rajpoot to Gowtham, OUT",short ball that bounces uncomfortably in front of him. Tries to fetch a pull and gets a top-edge that settles into the hands of midwicket
15.1,"Rajpoot to Gowtham, FOUR runs","ah, bad misfield at third man boundary from young Mujeeb. Gowtham slashed at the sight of a hint of width. Still not enough and he gets an edge that eventually gets to the boundary as Mujeeb over-runs to his right"
14.6,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, no run","drifts it away outside off this time, and Gowtham blocks off the outside of the bat"
14.5,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, no run",blocks this length ball that spins in extra and takes the inside of the bat into the leg side
14.4,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, 2 runs","length, spinning in outside off, tucks it away through midwicket for a quick brace"
14.3,"Mujeeb to Gowtham, 1 run","pitched up outside off, driven down to long-on"
14.3,"Mujeeb to Gowtham, 1 wide","ah, down the leg side. Just back of a length and drifts and spins past his attempted flick"
14.2,"Mujeeb to Archer, OUT","oh, beauty! What a delivery from Mujeeb. Top stuff from the legspinner. A googly that lands right on a length and draws him forward. Archer is unsuspecting and the ball spins right past his inside edge and clatters into the stumps"
14.1,"Mujeeb to Buttler, OUT","after a hundred swings and misses, finally an outside edge has been found. A carrom ball from Mujeeb, Buttler shapes to slap it away but ends up getting severely tucked up due to the lack of room and produces an edge"
13.6,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","another swing and a miss. Oh, jeez, he's been done in non-existent turn here. Expects it to come into him but it simply comes on with the arm outside off"
13.5,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","no turn again on this length ball, thinks of flicking but is forced to block back"
13.4,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","short, wide, non-turning, reaches out for a cut and misses"
13.3,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run",makes room for a short of a length delivery and punches between long-off and sweeper cover
13.2,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","short and wide, backs away and cuts it to short third man"
13.1,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","fullish on middle and leg, pushed back"
12.6,"Mujeeb to Buttler, FOUR runs",short and wide and Buttler wallops it to the point boundary to bring up back to back fifties
12.5,"Mujeeb to Stokes, OUT","the relay catch! Mayank grabs it at long-off, but he's overbalancing, he knows he will go over the boundary, so he lobs the ball over to Tiwary at long-on and it is seamless. It is poetry. It is very very good. And so Stokes has to go, after smacking a loopy old delivery on leg stump straight down the ground. The percentages were right. But Kings XI outdid him on two counts: Mujeeb followed his moving away to leg stump. And then Mayank stayed supremely calm on the boundary, leapt up to take the catch over his head, and then relayed the ball through at the perfect height to his mate Tiwary"
12.4,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run",rocks back and punches the quick and flat delivery on off stump through cover
12.3,"Mujeeb to Stokes, 1 run",backs away to flat bat a quicker delivery on off stump to long-off
12.2,"Mujeeb to Stokes, FOUR runs","ooh, that's good stuff. He plays the line - which is wide outside off - and unleashes a reverse sweep. With third man up inside the circle, it's an easy boundary"
12.1,"Mujeeb to Stokes, no run",draws him forward on off stump and Stokes flicks to short midwicket
11.6,"Ashwin to Stokes, 1 run",shimmies down the pitch to turn the ball on middle through midwicket
11.5,"Ashwin to Stokes, FOUR runs",superb hit! It doesn't matter that he's staying back to a ball that's fairly full. All that power he has comes into play the moment he has room to work with and he creams the ball through extra cover
11.4,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","good length, on off stump, punches to long-off"
11.3,"Ashwin to Buttler, 2 runs",on the pads and it doesn't spin as Ashwin wants it to. So Buttler can clip the carrom ball out to deep square leg
11.2,"Ashwin to Stokes, 1 run","offbreak, on a good length on off stump, Stokes works it through midwicket"
11.1,"Ashwin to Stokes, no run",carrom ball first up to the left-hander. It dips even as Stokes stretches forward to reach it. Misses the flick and hits the pad.
10.6,"Tye to Stokes, 1 run",rises up with the short ball aimed at his body and deflects it to long leg
10.5,"Tye to Samson, OUT","bounced out! And so simply done too! Digs it in short. Gets it to rise up towards the batsman's shoulder. Doesn't give him too much room to swing the arms, but Samson chooses to anyway. And sends the ball right down deep square leg's throat"
10.4,"Tye to Buttler, 1 run","another dipping delivery - this time at top pace - and it messes with Buttler's timing. He has his front leg cleared away. Tye does well to change his line and keep it wide of off stump. As a result, the batsman has to reach out, and ends up mistiming a bunt to long-on"
10.3,"Tye to Samson, 1 run",stands tall against a back of a length delivery and whips it to deep midwicket
10.2,"Tye to Samson, no run","draws him outside off with a good length ball and Samson, lunging in search of the ball, is beaten. Knuckle ball, gets a little extra kick"
10.1,"Tye to Buttler, 1 leg bye","lovely slower ball, mostly because it dips on the batsman, and Buttler is unable to cope with the sudden change in direction. Tries to flick, but it goes off the pad and barely leaves the square"
9.6,"Stoinis to Buttler, 1 run","shortish on off stump, knocks it down towards short cover and races across to the other end"
9.5,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run","shortish and outside off, Buttler wants a single behind point, opens the face looking for the gap, but can't find it"
9.4,"Stoinis to Samson, 1 run",presents the full face and the back of a length ball pings off it to long-off
9.3,"Stoinis to Buttler, 1 run","full on off stump, drives to long-off"
9.2,"Stoinis to Samson, 1 run",
9.1,"Stoinis to Samson, 2 runs","misfield from Ashwin at cover, which means a run-out opportunity goes a-begging! He rushes in, alert to the chance of a wicket, but it spins past his right and Samson, who was ball-watching, while his partner Buttler had raced off the blocks, finally ends up able to complete the run and get an extra"
8.6,"Tye to Buttler, FOUR runs","great connection, as he camps on the back foot, swivels with the pull shot and places it well to the right of the deep square leg fielder"
8.5,"Tye to Buttler, no run","that's at top pace, at 132 kph, and it's dug into the middle of the pitch. Buttler thinks about flat-batting it, but it gains too much height. Zips past his nose"
8.4,"Tye to Samson, 1 run","they are setting up for the slower balls. Samson waits in his power position, feet apart, bat high over his head, and then pulls the slower short ball to long-on"
8.3,"Tye to Buttler, 1 run","gets up close and personal with another slower ball, this time on middle, and pulls to deep midwicket"
8.2,"Tye to Buttler, 2 runs","picks the slower ball, holds his shape, waits until it is in his hitting arc outside off and cuts it away, nearly to the boundary at point. Some good work from Stoinis keeps it to two"
8.1,"Tye to Samson, 1 run","back of a length on middle, punches it down to long-on"
7.6,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run",gently dabs a length ball towards the right of sweeper cover for one
7.5,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 1 run","short, backs away and reaches out for a cut to sweeper cover"
7.4,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run",whips this length ball from around off to deep midwicket
7.3,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 1 run","just back of a length, straightens around off, punched to sweeper cover"
7.2,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, straightening around the sixth-stump channel, punched into the covers from the crease"
7.1,"Axar Patel to Samson, FOUR runs","full and curving in towards off, gets a good stride forward and drives through cover, beats deep point to his right comfortably"
6.6,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","drifts in towards leg stump, clipped away through square leg"
6.5,"Ashwin to Samson, FOUR runs","too short, and he rocks back and cuts late through backward point, beats the fielder in the deep to his left"
6.4,"Ashwin to Samson, no run",
6.3,"Ashwin to Samson, SIX runs","gives him a world of room by floating it up outside off, and it spins in from a length, giving him more leverage on the shot as he swings it over wide long-on for a big six"
6.2,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","flat length ball on middle and leg, punched down to long-on"
6.1,"Ashwin to Buttler, no run","gets down for a reverse sweep and misses to get hit on the pad. Given out almost instantly but Buttler reviews. The impact could have been outside off. Spins in a little but this could just be umpire's call on impact. Nope, it's just outside, so overturned"
5.6,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 1 run","short around off, backs away and cuts through cover"
5.5,"Axar Patel to Buttler, no run",backs away and cuts to cover
5.4,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 leg bye","gets down for a sweep but the length isn't quite right, wears it on the pad as it rolls away to short fine leg"
5.3,"Axar Patel to Samson, no run","back of a length, stays back and whips it against the turn between midwicket and long-on"
5.2,"Axar Patel to Samson, no run","length, sliding in on middle, drilled down the pitch off the inside of the bat"
5.1,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 1 run","full and flat on off, driven to long-off"
4.6,"Mujeeb to Samson, no run","takes it away from him this time, and Samson swings and misses"
4.5,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","pitched up outside off, pushed along the ground to long-on"
4.4,"Mujeeb to Samson, 1 run","length ball at 87.1ks, spins in at middle, flicked through midwicket"
4.3,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","fullish, spinning in around the pads, whipped off them between long-on and deep midwicket"
4.2,"Mujeeb to Samson, 1 run","sliding length ball around middle and leg, drilled down to long-on"
4.1,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","length outside off, minimal turn, and he opens the face to short third man"
3.6,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 1 run",punches a back of a length delivery to long-off
3.5,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run",pushes away from the body to a length ball and gets an outside edge to short third man
3.4,"Axar Patel to Rahane, OUT","has that been taken? Yes, Chris Gayle with a forward-diving catch. That's as rare a sight you'd see but it's true. Superb take as well. Rahane backed away and was looking to force a cut, but the back of room meant a thick outside edge, which is met by Gayle getting down and stooping low with both hands. They're going upstairs to check but he seems to have done alright. Yup, fingers underneath it. That should be out"
3.3,"Axar Patel to Buttler, 1 run","length outside off, meets the line and pats it away to square leg"
3.2,"Axar Patel to Rahane, 1 run","short of a length on a middle and leg line, mistimes a pull to short fine leg"
3.1,"Axar Patel to Rahane, no run",gets down to sweep a length ball and the ball shoots over the bat past the off-stump
2.6,"Mujeeb to Rahane, 1 run",turned away to deep midwicket
2.5,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 leg bye",moves towards the leg stump and tries to whip it away but the ball follows him and gives him no room as he is pinned on the pad. Comfortably missing leg
2.4,"Mujeeb to Buttler, FOUR runs",backs away to give himself some room on this short of a length delivery and punches it through wide of long-off
2.3,"Mujeeb to Rahane, 1 run","short of good length, minimal turn, stays back and whips it to the left of deep midwicket"
2.2,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","switches over to a good length outside off, Buttler plays a late cut to backward point and they immediately take off for the single. Rahul takes the bails off, but a dive has saved Rahane"
2.1,"Mujeeb to Rahane, 1 run","short of a length, spins away around off, whipped between long-on and midwicket"
1.6,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR runs","takes out the width but offers up the same length, and angles it into him as well, which allows Buttler to simply rock back and pull through midwicket. A horrific over from Rajpoot"
1.5,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR runs","that's awful bowling. Short and wide, and at Rajpoot's pace, it's a gift for Buttler as he opens up for a late slap through backward point"
1.4,"Rajpoot to Buttler, 4 byes","walks across for an ill-advised paddle to a back of a length delivery that's around two sets of stumps outside off. Needless to say, gets nowhere near it"
1.3,"Rajpoot to Buttler, no run","short of good length, cuts into his middle stump, Buttler backs away and haphazardly drops it into the pitch"
1.2,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR runs","short outside off, sits up nicely for Buttler who smokes a pull through the vacant midwicket region"
1.1,"Rajpoot to Rahane, 1 run","short of a length around off, tucked off the pads through midwicket"
0.6,"Ashwin to Buttler, no run","shortish, tries to heave a pull and mistimes it along the ground to midwicket"
0.5,"Ashwin to Buttler, no run","back of a length, punched into the covers"
0.4,"Ashwin to Buttler, FOUR runs","short of a length, sees a little room outside off, and punches through the left of cover for four"
0.3,"Ashwin to Short, OUT",Short has holed out third ball. That's a poor shot from the batsman. Takes no time to suss out the offspinner and simply swipes. Ashwin flattens his trajectory and slides this into middle and leg. Short expects it to come on with the arm but the ball straightens and as a result finds the outside of the bat as he looks to slog and lobs to midwicket
0.2,"Ashwin to Short, 2 runs","floats it up a little and slides it into the pads again, turned away through backward of square leg"
0.1,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","starts off with a fullish one that curves into his pads, and Buttler tucks it away through square leg"
19.6,"Krunal to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, and bunted to long on for a single. Cheers all around! Mumbai Indians win by 13 runs!"
19.5,"Krunal to Karthik, no run","back of a length on middle, and DK pulls to deep midwicket. Refuses the single"
19.4,"Krunal to Karthik, FOUR runs","low full toss, very wide outside off. DK gets down on one knee, and carves it over point. KKR need a six, but all they get is a four"
19.3,"Krunal to Karthik, no run","good length on leg stump, and DK tries to pull it. Tries to play it on one knee, but can't connect. Krunal appeals for lbw, and then asks for a review. Nah, it's going down leg"
19.2,"Krunal to Narine, OUT","full outside off, and angling away from Narine. Tries to lift it over cover, but slices it to the man on the circle. DK has crossed to the other side though!"
19.1,"Krunal to Narine, FOUR runs","full toss outside off, and that's in Narine's arc! Thumped past the non-striker to the straight boundary. Long-on just a spectator"
18.6,"Bumrah to Karthik, FOUR runs","dropped at deep backward square! And goes for four. Another low full toss on middle, and that's been whipped off his pads. Duminy got under it, but messes it all up. The ball pops out, takes a bounce, and then goes for four. Kolkata need 23 off the final over"
18.5,"Bumrah to Karthik, FOUR runs","overpitched on middle and leg, and DK gets his front leg out of the way to smash it straight! Long on had no chance. Good use of the crease's depth"
18.4,"Bumrah to Karthik, no run","short! On off stump, and soaring over his shoulders. DK tries to pull behind square, but can't connect at all"
18.3,"Bumrah to Karthik, no run","low full toss on middle, and DK swings wildly. Hits his bat's inside half and goes to fine leg. Says no to the single"
18.2,"Bumrah to Karthik, SIX runs","waist-high full toss, and that's been drilled over deep midwicket! The umpire at square leg says it's a legal delivery. Was close. McClenaghan tried to get his fingertips to it in the deep, but the ball sails just over"
18.1,"Bumrah to Karthik, no run","low full toss on leg stump, but Karthik can't put it away. Tried to slog it towards the leg side, but the ball hits his front leg"
17.6,"Pandya to Karthik, 1 run","short and wide outside off, but takes the pace off it again. DK crunches another cut, but the fielder at deep point came in there after the last ball"
17.5,"Pandya to Karthik, no run","slower ball, wide outside off. DK winds up to hit it straight, but the pace (or lack of it) does him in. Under edges it to Kishan. Hardik asks him to hold on to the ball"
17.4,"Pandya to Karthik, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and cut hard! Just past point, and beats the sweeper cover fielder as well!"
17.3,"Pandya to Karthik, no run","good length on off, and all DK can do is defend it towards the non-striker. Tight line, and the batsman gives it the respect it deserves"
17.2,"Pandya to Narine, 1 run","full on off, and Narine backs away to muscle it towards deep midwicket. Gets off the mark"
17.1,"Pandya to Narine, no run","slower ball full outside off, and Narine's big wind up doesn't connect. Inside edges it to the keeper"
16.6,"Bumrah to Karthik, 4 leg byes","what did that come off?! Yorker outside leg, and it's a really quick delivery. DK can't connect, and the ball comes off his boot. Kishan dives to his left but can't get his hands to it either. Important runs for KKR to end the 17th"
16.5,"Bumrah to Karthik, FOUR runs","full outside off, and DK carves it over point. Bends his knee to get under the ball, and then drives over the infield"
16.4,"Bumrah to Russell, OUT","back of a length on middle, but Russell makes a lot of room on the leg side. Pulls it towards the leg side, but Krunal takes a screamer! He's at short fine leg, but needs to race towards the square-leg boundary. Dives forward, and takes an excellent catch!"
16.3,"Bumrah to Karthik, 1 run","full outside off, and Russell almost gets under it. Drills it past the umpire, and long on does well to cut it off"
16.2,"Bumrah to Russell, 1 run","cramps Russell! Aimed at leg stump, and with the batsman backing away, it's a perfect delivery. Russell tried to pull, but in trying to protect himself, he plays it back to Bumrah"
16.1,"Bumrah to Karthik, 1 run","slower ball, but wide outside off. It's a length delivery, so DK cuts it square to the man in the deep. Singles are fine for Mumbai"
15.6,"Markande to Russell, no run","full on middle, and no spin this time. Russell takes a big stride forward and defends it back to young Markande. Time out"
15.5,"Markande to Russell, FOUR runs","too wide outside off, and then spinning sharply inwards. Russell goes deep into his crease and thumps a flat-batted shot to the wide long-on boundary"
15.4,"Markande to Karthik, 1 run","good length on off stump, and Karthik makes some room to free his arms. Cut off the backfoot to the man in the deep"
15.3,"Markande to Karthik, no run","backs away before the ball was bowled, and Markande goes short on middle. Turns sharply into DK's body, and forces the error from the batsman. Hits his pads"
15.2,"Markande to Russell, 1 run","good length on leg, and Russell clips it off his toes to square leg"
15.1,"Markande to Russell, no run","full on leg stump, and straightens after pitching. Russell misses the leg-side tap, and it comes off his pads"
14.6,"McClenaghan to Russell, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and Russell flays a cut towards backward point. All he can earn is a single"
14.5,"McClenaghan to Russell, no run","offcutter that Russell can't pitch. It was short on off, and he had walked across to the off side. Hits his body, but rather gently, as he misses the leg-side whip"
14.4,"McClenaghan to Karthik, 1 run","full on off, and that's been defended with soft hands. Cover's too deep, so they can walk across for another run"
14.3,"McClenaghan to Karthik, no run","goes short outside leg, and DK wants to pull. He can't connect, and goes through to Kishan. What's surprising is the umpire doesn't call it a wide. Karthik is bemused"
14.2,"McClenaghan to Russell, 1 run","good length outside off, and angling away from Dre. He stands tall and punches it towards the gap near cover"
14.1,"McClenaghan to Karthik, 1 run","full outside off, and he can't put it away. Mistimes the cut to point, who misfields himself, which allows DK to get off strike"
13.6,"Pandya to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, and DK chops it down to the man at third man for a walking single. He'll keep strike"
13.5,"Pandya to Russell, 1 run","back of a length, and carved towards point"
13.4,"Pandya to Karthik, 1 run","full outside off, and that's been caressed towards McClenaghan at sweeper cover"
13.3,"Pandya to Rana, OUT","back of a length on middle, and Rana goes for a pull. It's been sliced though, and Bumrah gets under it at deep square leg! The ball was swirling in the air, so extra marks for that effort. KKR losing wickets in a clump once again"
13.2,"Pandya to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length on off, and DK glances it down to third man. A safe way to get off the mark"
13.1,"Pandya to Rana, 1 run","back of a length on middle, but takes the pace off it. Tiptoes, opens his bat's face, and then runs it down to third man"
12.6,"Markande to Rana, 1 run","full on middle stump, and driven with the turn to long off. They walk across to collect a single"
12.5,"Markande to Rana, no run","good length on middle, and backs away to punch it towards cover"
12.4,"Markande to Rana, no run","on leg stump, and it's the wrong'un once again. Defended off the front foot with soft hands"
12.3,"Markande to Uthappa, OUT","conventional legbreak, and that earns him the wicket! Straight to long off. Full outside off, and Uthappa plays it straight down the ground. The ball spun away slightly, and induced the shot from the bat's toe end. Markande makes amends after all!"
12.2,"Markande to Rana, 1 run","full outside leg, but turning into his body. Gets down on one knee, and sweeps it uppishly to deep backward square"
12.1,"Markande to Rana, no run","full on middle, and turning away from Rana. Sticks his bat out and taps it to point"
11.6,"Cutting to Uthappa, no run","fuller, on off and that's been driven to cover. A dot to start and a dot to end for Cutting. But four boundaries in the middle. Great over for the visitors"
11.5,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR runs","fourth boundary in a row! Short on off, but Cutting doesn't have the pace to trouble Uthappa. Takes his backfoot deep, and swivels a pull over short fine leg"
11.4,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR runs","crunched over midwicket! Good length on off, but Uthappa walks across to the off side and checks a pull shot over the infield. Placed to perfection, and what a way to get to your first IPL 2018 fifty!"
11.3,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and cut away furiously past the two infielders. No one's there in the deep, and that's the team hundred!"
11.2,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR runs","full on off, and Uthappa was ready for the slower ball. He walked across to the off side, and paddles this behind square. Beats the man at square leg, and the sweeper fielder can't cut it off either"
11.1,"Cutting to Uthappa, no run","on a good length, and pitching on middle stump, Uthappa backs away to cut it square, but can only find the man at cover point"
10.6,"Bumrah to Uthappa, 1 run","full and wide outside off, but takes the pace off (123.8kph). Uthappa wants to drive it towards cover, but he's played it too early. Hits the bat's toe end, and goes over the umpire's head. Lands in no man's land"
10.5,"Bumrah to Rana, 1 run","good length on leg, and the punch towards the on-side takes a leading edge. Goes through towards cover"
10.4,"Bumrah to Rana, no run","slower ball, full on middle but angling across Rana. He tried to run it down fine, but the ball sneaks past his outside edge. Taken by Kishan on the bounce"
10.3,"Bumrah to Uthappa, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and Uthappa can't resist to pull. Mistimed over the non-striker's head to long on"
10.2,"Bumrah to Rana, 1 run","full outside off, and punched to McClenaghan at sweeper cover. A wild throw that hits Rana's bat but Lewis does well to back up"
10.1,"Bumrah to Rana, no run","appeal for caught behind! But not given. Came off something, but not the bat. Good length outside leg, but goes over the top of leg stump as Rana misses the clip off his pads. Replays show it flicked his trouser"
9.6,"Cutting to Uthappa, no run","offcutter outside off, and he opens the bat's face to run it down to third man. Uthappa wants the run, but there's none on offer"
9.5,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR runs","slower ball yorker, but outside leg stump. Uthappa checks his shot, and eventualy whips it off his toes. Played over square leg, and no one's there in the deep."
9.4,"Cutting to Rana, 1 run","sticks with the slower ball. On a good length and angling away from Rana. Mistimes the cut, but finds the gap on this occasion. Deep point cleans up"
9.3,"Cutting to Rana, no run","short on off, and angling away from Rana. Tries to cut it square, but off the bat's toe end. Trickles away to cover point"
9.2,"Cutting to Uthappa, 1 run","offcutter on off stump, and Uthappa comes inside the line of the ball to clip it off his hips. Played to deep backward square"
9.1,"Cutting to Rana, 1 run","good length outside off, but he starts off with the slower ball. Opens his bat's face and waits for the delivery to come to him, before glancing it to third man"
8.6,"Krunal to Uthappa, FOUR runs","freebie! Full toss on off, and Uthappa backs away to thump it over cover! Wide long off does not bother moving an inch"
8.5,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","good length on middle and leg, and Uthappa makes further room on the leg side to punch it straight down the ground. Krunal gets his body behind it, and saves the single"
8.4,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","yes, no, yes, no! Uthappa's safe though! Tapped towards point, and Uthappa wants the run. Rana says no, and he's forced to turn back. Does well to slide in before Kishan can dislodge the bails"
8.3,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","wide outside off, and Uthappa makes room to cut. But can't find the gap as point pounces onto it in a flash"
8.2,"Krunal to Uthappa, 2 runs","good length on middle, and worked off his pads towards deep midwicket. Good use of his wrists to direct it there"
8.1,"Krunal to Rana, 1 run","almost a yorker on off, and Rana digs it away towards midwicket for a walking single"
7.6,"Markande to Uthappa, SIX runs","way too wide outside off, and Uthappa leans into this one. Swats it over Markande's head, and the ball lands on the sightscreen!"
7.5,"Markande to Uthappa, SIX runs","picks the googly beautifully! Full outside off, and slogs this with the spin over deep midwicket! Sixth IPL batsman to get to 4000 runs. What a way to reach the milestone."
7.4,"Markande to Uthappa, no run","good length outside off, and Uthappa chooses to play this fine. Cut straight to short third man though"
7.3,"Markande to Uthappa, no run","googly! Good length on middle, and turns into his body. Gets big on the batsman, so he wedges it onto his thighs"
7.2,"Markande to Rana, 1 run","good length on middle, and this one zips through. Forced to stay on the back foot, and punched to mid on"
7.1,"Markande to Rana, FOUR runs","full on leg stump, and he takes a big stride forward to meet the sweep on the full. Placed well behind square, and Krunal Pandya's diving effort just ain't good enough"
6.6,"Krunal to Rana, 1 run",worked off the pads past square leg's right
6.5,"Krunal to Rana, FOUR runs","dropped short and sliding away outside off, that's ripe for the cut. Rana goes on the back foot and cracks it away to the left of backward point"
6.4,"Krunal to Uthappa, 1 run","skids on just a shade outside off, Uthappa camps back and punches a single down to long-on"
6.3,"Krunal to Uthappa, SIX runs","tossed liberally on middle, full, Uthappa clears his front leg and launches it over Pandya's head and the sightscreen. Terrific timing although it was in his swinging arc"
6.2,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","non-turning back-of-a-length ball just a shade outside off, tapped to cover"
6.1,"Krunal to Rana, 1 run","back of a length and angling away outside off from around the wicket, punched wide of midwicket"
5.6,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run","looks like a knuckle ball outside off, the batsman delays his shot and dabs to point"
5.6,"Pandya to Uthappa, 1 wide","another lifter on middle, sails past the head, too high, and that's a wide"
5.5,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run","wide of the crease, bouncer on middle, fizzes past the helmet as Uthappa is late onto a hook"
5.4,"Pandya to Uthappa, 2 runs","hip-high short ball outside off, swatted across the line to deep midwicket"
5.3,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run","back of a length and outside off, opens the face and dabs to point"
5.2,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run","Markande backpedals and drops a sitter! Pandya is shocked. Back of a length, slower ball outside off, this is more a short-arm flap as opposed to a short-arm pull. He drags it in the air, Markande does not have a stable base, and the ball pops out"
5.1,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run","short from wide of the crease, Uthappa's weight is on the front foot, the ball gets big on him, gloves it in the air but wide of the stumps"
4.6,"McClenaghan to Rana, SIX runs","short and outside off, Rana is airborne as he scythes an uppercut up and over third man. Sails over the deep fielder for six"
4.5,"McClenaghan to Rana, no run","lifter outside off, Rana aims cut it away but is beaten by extra bounce"
4.4,"McClenaghan to Rana, 2 runs","back of a length and outside off, chopped in the gap at point"
4.3,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, 1 run","back of a length and angling away outside off, Uthappa uses the angle and angles it down to third man"
4.2,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run","back of a length and angling across off, patted into the covers"
4.1,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, 2 runs","overpitched and outside off, Uthappa stretches out and drives sweetly straight of mid-off. Hardik throws himself to his right, half-stops the ball"
3.6,"Pandya to Rana, no run","pitched up and sliding away outside off, closer to off this time, left alone"
3.5,"Pandya to Rana, no run","back of a length and angling across off again, left alone again"
3.4,"Pandya to Rana, FOUR runs","just short of a good length and outside off, Rana frees his arms and chops it hard to the ground, beats point to his right"
3.3,"Pandya to Rana, no run","back of a length and angling across off, left alone"
3.2,"Pandya to Uthappa, 1 run",picked off the pads to deep midwicket
3.1,"Pandya to Gill, OUT","Gill caught Pandya bowled Pandya. Hardik floats a slower offcutter outside off first up. Gill does not spot it. He is early into a drive and gets more height as opposed to distance. Krunal snuffles the catch at mid-off, has his hands aloft and roars Wakanda forever. Two wickets in three balls for Mumbai"
2.6,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run",McClenaghan hits a hard length on middle and leg - neither driveable nor pullable - punched back to the bowler off the back foot
2.5,"McClenaghan to Lynn, OUT","The short ball finally works for McClenaghan and Mumbai. Chest-high ball on middle, tucks Lynn up for room. He still goes for the pull, hits it well, but picks out Bumrah at short fine leg"
2.4,"McClenaghan to Lynn, FOUR runs","keeps it short, angling away outside off, just over the hips. Lynn waits for this length on the back-foot and swats it away to the midwicket fence"
2.3,"McClenaghan to Lynn, FOUR runs","skiddy, short ball on the hips, pulled away past square leg for another four"
2.2,"McClenaghan to Gill, 1 run","short on leg stump, cramps the batsman for room, dragged away square of short fine leg"
2.1,"McClenaghan to Gill, FOUR runs","Make that 16 runs off the last four balls. Floated full and wide outside off, Gill is early into a drive but flat-bats it past the left of the bowler"
1.6,"Bumrah to Lynn, 4 byes","Bumrah nearly chops Lynn into half! 142ks, back of a length and zips back in from wide of the crease. There's that sharp angle from Bumrah. Beats the inside edge, beats off stump, and beats a diving Kishan. Two fours followed by four byes. KKR won't complain"
1.5,"Bumrah to Lynn, FOUR runs","115ks slower, back-of-a-length ball outside off, Lynn delays his punch and hits it past the left of mid-off and short cover for back-to-back fours"
1.4,"Bumrah to Lynn, FOUR runs","back of a length and outside off, Lynn flashes at it and sends a thick outside edge between wide slip and regular short third man for four"
1.3,"Bumrah to Lynn, no run","wide of the crease, 136.4ks, bouncer aimed at Lynn's head, he ducks under it and lets it sail through to Kishan behind the stumps"
1.2,"Bumrah to Lynn, no run","142.5ks back-of-a-length ball, straightening away outside off, Lynn throws his hands at the ball but only collects fresh air. Encouraging carry to Kishan"
1.1,"Bumrah to Gill, 1 run","Bumrah ventures wide of the crease, but this shortish ball holds its line outside off, Gill rides it down to deep third man for one"
0.6,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run","back of a length and wide outside off, in Lynn's swinging arc, slapped away fiercely but straight to point who has moved back in from the deep"
0.5,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run","McClenaghan brings out his hit-the-deck bustle. Banged in short on middle, Lynn arches his back and lets it fly through to Kishan"
0.4,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run","much fuller and on middle stump, Lynn, however, hangs back and taps it back to the left of the bowler"
0.3,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run","beats the outside edge, and the off stump! Back of a length, skipping away with the angle from over the wicket, Lynn hangs back, has a lousy waft, and misses"
0.2,"McClenaghan to Gill, 1 run","back of a length and into the hips of Gill, punched past the right of mid-on for one"
0.1,"McClenaghan to Lynn, 1 run","back of a length and angling across off from over the wicket, dabbed through point with soft hands"
19.6,"Prasidh to Pandya, 1 run","full and wide outside off, and this time he inside-edges the drive towards the keeper's left. They steal the single. Mumbai Indians finish on 181 for 4"
19.5,"Prasidh to Pandya, no run","full toss outside off, but Hardik can't connect. The bat's gone flying too! Goes to the keeper on the bounce, who has a shy at the stumps. Misses! Hardik would've been gone"
19.4,"Prasidh to Pandya, FOUR runs","unlucky! The pace earns Hardik another boundary. Goes for the wide yorker, and Hardik's wild slash takes the bat's toe end. Goes between third man and the keeper this time"
19.4,"Prasidh to Pandya, 1 wide","full and wide outside off, and Hardik attempts a expansive drive. The ball goes under Hardik's bat, but on the wide-line. The umpire calls extras"
19.3,"Prasidh to Pandya, FOUR runs","full outside off, and this time the slower ball has deceived the batsman beautifully. But the game's cruel, so Hardik will earn a boundary. Slices this drive over DK's head"
19.2,"Prasidh to Duminy, 1 run","slower ball, and angling across Duminy. With all his might, the batsman tries to slog, but can only find the man at long on"
19.1,"Prasidh to Duminy, no run","Short, and Duminy can't pull it away! Duminy wants it to be a wide, but the ball went over leg stump. Excellent!"
18.6,"Narine to Duminy, 1 run","good length outside off, and Duminy shuffles across to that side to pull again. Not well connected this time"
18.5,"Narine to Pandya, 1 run","good length outside off, and he muscles a pull to the man at deep midwicket. Off the bat's inside half"
18.4,"Narine to Duminy, 1 run","full on off, and he gets down on one knee to slog sweep. There's a fielder in the deep for that shot"
18.3,"Narine to Duminy, 2 runs","tossed up, but full outside off. Squeezed away towards wide long on, and collects a couple more"
18.2,"Narine to Duminy, SIX runs","good length outside off, but Duminy walks across to the off side to meet it. Swings towards the leg side, and manages to get enough behind it to clear cow corner"

17.6,"Johnson to Pandya, 1 run","full outside off, and driven straight past Johnson's right. Man at long on cleans up"
17.5,"Johnson to Duminy, 1 leg bye",slower ball to end the over. Cutter on leg stump and further angling into Duminy. Tried to slog it towards the leg side but deceived completely
17.5,"Johnson to Duminy, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, but way too wide on this occasion. Duminy tried his best, however, to slap it over the infield"
17.4,"Johnson to Duminy, no run",short! Duminy sways to get under the line of the ball. A well-directed bouncer from Johnson
17.3,"Johnson to Duminy, no run","sees the batsman charging down, and Johnson goes short and wide. Forces Duminy to reach at it, and he can't get bat to ball!"
17.2,"Johnson to Duminy, 2 runs","full on middle and leg, and Duminy clips it off his toes to the sweeper fielder on the leg side"
17.1,"Johnson to Pandya, 1 run","good length outside off, and lifted over Johnson's head. Tried to swing through that arc, but comes off the bat's toe end"
17.1,"Johnson to Pandya, 1 wide","cutter outside off, but the umpire thinks it's too wide. Hardik had let it go anyway. Johnson's not pleased with the umpire's call. Looked like it was just inside the tramlines though!"
16.6,"Narine to Duminy, no run","good length outside off, and zipping further away. Tries to cut, but the ball stays low! Well taken by DK"
16.5,"Narine to Krunal, OUT","finds Gill at long on! Tries the same shot, but Narine went shorter. The leg-side heave comes off the bat's toe end, and Krunal fails to find the distance on this occasion. He's disappointed!"
16.4,"Narine to Krunal, SIX runs","good length on middle, and Krunal's big back lift comes to the party. Hits through the ball's line, and sent over the long on boundary"
16.3,"Narine to Pandya, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and turns into Hardik's pads. Works it off his hips to the man at deep midwicket"
16.2,"Narine to Krunal, 1 run","good length on middle, and Krunal flat-bats it over the non-striker. Man at long off, but it lands just in front of him"
16.1,"Narine to Krunal, no run","good length on leg stump, and Krunal can't paddle it away. Hits his front leg, but the appeal is turned down. Bounced just outside leg"
15.6,"Prasidh to Pandya, FOUR runs","cheeky! Good length outside off, but Hardik's done playing convention. Steps across to the off side, hides his face, and then paddles it over his shoulder! No one at fine leg, and Hardik ends the over with consecutive boundaries."
15.5,"Prasidh to Pandya, FOUR runs","short outside off, and that's been crunched off the back foot! Cut square, and sweeper cover is too slow to react. Muscles this one"
15.4,"Prasidh to Krunal, 1 run","good length on middle, and lifted off the back foot! Hit over midwicket, but Chawla's manning that region in the deep. Looks like the captain is asking Chawla why he didn't attack the ball"
15.3,"Prasidh to Krunal, no run","well deceived! Slow and full outside off, and Krunal's through his slog way too early. Goes past his bat's edge, and through to DK on the bounce"
15.2,"Prasidh to Pandya, 1 run","full on off stump, and Hardik digs this away towards deep midwicket. Couldn't get under the ball, or as much as he'd like to"

14.6,"Russell to Krunal, 1 run","back of a length on leg stump, and Krunal punches it towards midwicket. He'll keep strike"
14.5,"Russell to Krunal, no run","short again! And the keeper appeals for caught behind. Russell isn't convinced though. It was on leg stump, and Krunal was cramped to play that pull. Goes over his gloves. The appeal, however, may have saved KKR from getting that wide"
14.4,"Russell to Krunal, no run","short outside off, and Krunal goes chasing after it. Tried to slap it over third man, but can't get bat to ball"
14.3,"Russell to Krunal, FOUR runs","short, but that's first-ball four! Yanks a pull over the fielder at midwicket, and the shot has the legs to reach the boundary"
14.2,"Russell to Yadav, OUT","tickles it to the keeper! Good length on the fourth-stump line, and it's too close to his body for the cut. Finds the edge and DK does the rest. The heat has played its part too. He was really late to play that shot"
14.1,"Russell to Pandya, 1 run","slower ball outside off, and that's been mistimed down the ground to long on. A gentle punch"
13.6,"Johnson to Pandya, 1 run","slower offcutter, grips and bounces, poked to the covers. Well-deserved break for Suryakumar and myself"
13.5,"Johnson to Pandya, no run","full and outside off, forward and driven through the line to cover"

12.5,"Chawla to Pandya, 1 run","very full and skids in, turned to the leg side"
12.4,"Chawla to Pandya, SIX runs","One-handed six from Pandya! Tossed up and spins away, finishes on off, Pandya stretches out, yanks his bottom hand off the bat, still finds enough power and elevation to lift it over the wide long-off boundary"
12.3,"Chawla to Pandya, no run","looks like a faster googly, swerves in, forward and blocked to the leg side"
12.2,"Chawla to Yadav, 1 run","really full and outside off, Suryakumar replied with a steel-wristed flick to wide long-on"
12.1,"Chawla to Yadav, FOUR runs","Chawla lobs up a legbreak outside off, Suryakumar ventures outside leg and drives it inside-out. Lifted up and over short extra cover"

11.5,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run","skidding into the pads, nearly 100ks, nudged through square leg"
11.4,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, OUT","Rohit slog-sweeps with the break but picks out Rinku, the sub fielder, at deep midwicket. Tossed up and spins in on middle, Rohit drops down on one knee but skews it off the bottom of the bat to the man in the deep. Only the second wicket away from home for Narine in IPL 2018"
11.3,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, no run","fuller than a good length and spins back in on middle stump, defended to the leg side"
11.2,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","Rohit stretches across off, goes low, and paddles this full ball down to fine leg"
11.1,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length and slides on just a shade outside off, hangs back and whips through midwicket for his fourth fifty of the season. His captain Rohit embraces him"
10.6,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, no run","Chawla slips in a googly, turns in just a touch, Rohit smothers it with a forward defence back to the bowler"
10.5,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","back of a length and skidding into the thigh, Rohit hangs back and works the ball away to deep square leg"
10.4,"Chawla to Yadav, 1 run","slower legbreak, turns away and finishes on off, tip and run to point"
10.3,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","fired outside off, pushed to short cover, Kuldeep fumbles, allows a single"
10.2,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","overpitched and outside off, another poor ball from Chawla, Rohit simply leans into it, collapses his back leg, and drives it through the covers, beats sweeper cover to his right"
10.1,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, no run","tossed up liberally and angled in on off, Rohit stretches out, meets the pitch, and pats it back down the pitch"
9.6,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","back of a length just outside off, and Rohit opens his bat's face to glance it towards short third man"
9.5,"Russell to Yadav, 1 run","full on middle, and Suryakumar moves on to 48 with that nudge towards deep midwicket. They jog across for the run"
9.5,"Russell to Yadav, 1 wide","yorker, but way outside leg stump. Suryakumar misses the flick, but Mumbai still earn the run"
9.4,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short outside off, and Rohit cuts it to the man at third man. Gets off the mark. He's been out for a duck twice this season"
9.3,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, no run","back of a length on off, and he walks inside the line of the ball, before pushing it towards the leg side"
9.2,"Russell to Lewis, OUT","slower ball, and that does the trick! Full on off, and Lewis is tempted to go for the biggie. Tries to drive over cover, but slices it down short third man's throat. Comfortably for Lynn"
9.1,"Russell to Lewis, 2 runs","full on middle, and tapped towards the vacant midwicket region. The man in the deep has to come charging in, but can't stop the second run"
8.6,"Kuldeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","dropped short and sliding away outside off, Suryakumar uses the depth of the crease, use of pace and angle of Kuldeep, and chops it away past short third man for another four"

8.4,"Kuldeep to Lewis, no run","Kuldeep hangs it up in the air, dips, and breaks away outside off. Lewis can't connect with the sweep"

8.2,"Kuldeep to Lewis, 1 run",Lewis stays leg-side of the ball and drives to wide long-off
8.1,"Kuldeep to Lewis, no run","back of a length and spins away outside off, chopped to point"
7.6,"Rana to Yadav, FOUR runs","loopier and fuller outside off, enough width for Suryakumar to collapse his back leg and lace a drive between sweeper cover and wide long-off. Impeccable placement again from Suryakumar"
7.5,"Rana to Lewis, 1 run","100.8ks dart on middle stump, Lewis races down the track, converts it into a full-toss, and belts it back to the left of Rana. He stretches his hands to his left but the force of the shot ensures the ball bursts out. Dropped, but that was a very difficult chance. Such ones stick or they just don't. The umpire was in the firing line too"
7.5,"Rana to Lewis, 1 wide","slower through the air but heading down leg, past the sweep. Leg-side wide"
7.4,"Rana to Lewis, FOUR runs","speared very full just a shade outside off, Lewis jumps outside leg and looks to cart it through the covers. Instead, he toe-ends it away to the left of DK behind the stumps and right of short third man. Fortunate four"
7.3,"Rana to Yadav, 1 run","shorter and darted in on middle stump, forced off the back foot to deep midwicket for one"
7.2,"Rana to Yadav, FOUR runs","a bit too full on middle stump, Suryakumar concentrates on placement as opposed to power. He stretches out and flicks it with the wrists between deep midwicket and wide long-on"
7.1,"Rana to Lewis, 1 run","back of a length and skidding into the pads, punched up to long-on"
6.6,"Kuldeep to Yadav, no run","very full, and very wide outside off. Tries to carve it towards point, but finds the fielder there once again."
6.5,"Kuldeep to Yadav, no run","good length on off, but he goes towards the leg side to make some room. Cut it square, but only to point"
6.4,"Kuldeep to Yadav, SIX runs","uses his feet, and sends this over wide long on! Caught on to the length early, and thumps it towards the leg side."
6.3,"Kuldeep to Lewis, 1 run","flighted on middle stump, but Lewis gets inside the line of the ball. Flicks it to square leg"
6.2,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 1 run","good length on off, but doesn't spin into his pads. Pulled off the back foot towards deep midwicket on this occasion"
6.1,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 2 runs","full just outside off, and he brings out the late cut. Played delicately off DK's right, and Lynn goes chasing after it"
5.6,"Chawla to Lewis, no run","full on leg, and Lewis' leg-side push takes the leading edge towards cover. Time out"
5.5,"Chawla to Lewis, no run","full on off, and the drive's been sliced to point! Narine fails to get forward. Lands just in front of him"
5.4,"Chawla to Lewis, no run","almost a yorker on middle stump, and Lewis does well to squeeze it back to Chawla"
5.3,"Chawla to Lewis, FOUR runs","full on off stump, and he's trapped on the front foot. Tries to defend, but takes the outside edge. Oh dear, he's managed to play it fine enough!"
5.2,"Chawla to Lewis, FOUR runs","that's the fifty partnership! Tossed up outside off, but manages to pick the googly well. Lifted inside out over cover, and some good use of the feet on show"
5.1,"Chawla to Lewis, SIX runs","freebie! Full toss on middle, and that's been sent into the top tier! Waist high, and tonked towards the midwicket boundary."
4.6,"Prasidh to Lewis, 1 run","yorker on off! Good comeback, but well played by Lewis. Dug away towards cover for a quick run"
4.5,"Prasidh to Lewis, SIX runs","back of a length, and in Lewis' slot! Goes onto the back foot, and pulls it over deep midwicket. Off the bat's sweet spot"
4.4,"Prasidh to Yadav, 1 run","full just outside off, and he carves it off the front foot towards cover point. Tried to play it straighter than where it went"
4.3,"Prasidh to Lewis, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and Lewis swivels to pull. Off the bat's inside half, and only to the man at short fine leg. Enough time to steal the single"
4.2,"Prasidh to Yadav, 1 run","full just outside off, and driven straight. Russell was lurking at mid on, so they had to run quick. Comfortably completed in the end"
4.1,"Prasidh to Yadav, no run","short outside of, and Suryakumar cuts it late. Straight to short third man though. Slightly better direction and that would've been four"
3.6,"Narine to Lewis, FOUR runs","shorter outside off, and this time Lewis is quick to spot the length. Goes deep, and brings out the punch past extra cover"
3.5,"Narine to Lewis, FOUR runs","fuller on off stump, and mistimed towards the leg side! Tried to hit straight, but comes off the bat's inside half. Beats Krishna at midwicket as well"
3.4,"Narine to Lewis, no run","full just outside off, and Lewis shuffles forward to tap it towards the off side"
3.3,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run","fuller outside off, and this time it's been driven past the non-striker to the man at long on"
3.2,"Narine to Yadav, no run","big appeal for lbw, but that's a bad shout. Full outside off, and although he missed the sweep, impact was way outside off"
3.1,"Narine to Yadav, no run",
2.6,"Johnson to Yadav, 1 run","better line. Good length on off, and forces the batsman to play from near his body. Fended towards cover point with soft hands"
2.5,"Johnson to Yadav, FOUR runs","wide outside off, and perfect for the batsman with the ball angling away. Cut furiously past the fielder at point for another boundary"
2.4,"Johnson to Yadav, no run","full outside off, and he shuffles towards the ball's direction. Brings out the drive, but can't pierce the gap this time"
2.3,"Johnson to Yadav, FOUR runs","wide outside off, and that's been drilled through the cover region! Big stride forward and timed to perfection"
2.2,"Johnson to Yadav, SIX runs","short on middle, but not too fast. Suryakumar pulls, and although that's taken the top edge, it manages to clear the backward square boundary. Mighty close"
2.1,"Johnson to Yadav, no run","good length outside off, and angling across his body. Opens his bat's face and glances it towards point"
1.6,"Prasidh to Lewis, 2 runs","good length on middle, and Lewis tucks it towards fine leg for a comfortable double. Whipped off his hips"
1.5,"Prasidh to Yadav, 1 run",full on off and angling into his pads. Suryakumar shuffles across to the off side and drives towards mid on. Diving effort from Russell at mid on saves the team a certain boundary
1.4,"Prasidh to Yadav, no run","width offered again, but this time Suryakumar can't time it well. Too wide, actually, and therefore his cut finds the bat's toe end. Krishna will feel relieved "
1.3,"Prasidh to Yadav, no run","good length outside off, and he stays on the back foot to push towards the off side"
1.2,"Prasidh to Yadav, FOUR runs","short outside off, and Sky makes full use of the width. Climbs over the bounce and cuts it between backward point and point. Classy"
1.1,"Prasidh to Yadav, no run","good length outside off, and the batsman goes onto the back foot to punch towards cover. No nerves for Prasidh"
0.6,"Rana to Lewis, no run","ends the over with a full delivery. Straight on middle and leg, and Lewis shuffles behind to tap it back to the bowler. Tidy start for KKR"
0.5,"Rana to Lewis, no run",zips through! Good length on off and skids into Lewis' pads. Impact outside leg though
0.4,"Rana to Lewis, no run","gives it some more air this time. Full just outside off, and Lewis fends it back to Rana"
0.3,"Rana to Lewis, no run","good length outside off, and Lewis punches this off the back foot towards cover. That area's packed with men in purple though"
0.2,"Rana to Lewis, no run","good length outside off, but angling into Lewis. Drills it straight back to Rana, who does well to get his body behind it"
0.1,"Rana to Yadav, 1 run","short on middle, and going down leg side. But Suryakumar wants to get bat on ball, and therefore muscles it towards deep midwicket"
19.5,"Christian to Williamson, 1 run","full outside off, and that's been worked towards the leg side. No one's in the deep, so SRH finish with a boundary. Sunrisers win by seven wickets!"
19.4,"Christian to Pathan, 1 run","full on leg stump, but Yusuf backs away to the leg side to drill this straight down the ground. Only a single"
19.3,"Christian to Pathan, FOUR runs","short on middle, and that's been pulled. Yusuf top-edges it, and that's perfectly fine, since short fine leg was inside the circle"
19.2,"Christian to Pathan, SIX runs","full toss way outside off, and Yusuf leans into this loosener. Bends his knee, and pumps it over the bowler's head. Straight into the sightscreen"
19.1,"Christian to Pathan, 2 runs","short and wide outside off, and that's been flat-batted towards the bowler. Christian drops the catch, but manages to go towards mid on to collect the ball. Then has a shy at the stumps, and hey, it's a direct hit! Williamson's just in. So that's two to the total."
18.6,"Boult to Pathan, 1 run","full toss outside off, but all Yusuf can do is muscle it down the ground to long of. SRH need 14 off the final over!"
18.5,"Boult to Williamson, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, and Williamson taps it towards cow corner"
18.4,"Boult to Pathan, 1 run","full toss on off, and it's been bunted inside out towards cover. Allows them to take the single"
18.4,"Boult to Pathan, 1 wide",full and very wide outside off. He tries to drive away from his body but can't connect. Pant's not happy that's been called a wide
18.3,"Boult to Pathan, FOUR runs","low full toss outside off, and that's been slapped between point and cover point! Not sure where he attempted to hit it, but the ball turned in his hand, and therefore sliced it behind square"
18.2,"Boult to Pathan, no run","full and straight on middle, and Yusuf misses the leg-side slog. Got his front leg out of the way to try and hit it, but hits his back leg. Huuuuge appeal, and it's been given lbw. KW asks Yusuf to review. It's pitched juuuuuust outside leg, so Yusuf survives! Oh, this was really really close."
18.1,"Boult to Pathan, SIX runs","full outside off, and that's in Yusuf's arc! Takes a step forward and thumps it over long on. Off the bat's sweet spot, and that's gone 83 metres!"
17.6,"Plunkett to Pathan, 1 run","good length on off, and angling into Pathan. Slogs it towards the leg side, but men there in the deep"
17.5,"Plunkett to Williamson, 1 run","yorker on leg stump, as Williamson comes down the wicket. Cramped for space, and all he can do is squeeze it towards the leg side"
17.4,"Plunkett to Pathan, 1 run","good length on middle, and it's been pulled straight to deep backward square. But dropped by Shankar! He got under it, but the ball dipped late, which forced the error from him"
17.3,"Plunkett to Pathan, no run","short outside off, and Yusuf can't connect with the pull. Not a wide, but that's one for the over"
17.2,"Plunkett to Williamson, 1 run","good length on off, and Williamson has all the time to choose his spot. But all he can do is pull it to deep backward square"
17.1,"Plunkett to Pandey, OUT","full outside off, and he's sliced it! Shaw's getting under it from extra cover, and he holds on to a pressure catch. Iyer comes to celebrate with the youngster. Silences the crowd"
16.6,"Boult to Williamson, 2 runs","slower ball on middle, and he plays the inside-out cover drive to the man in the deep. He'll have to hurry at the danger end, but he makes it with ease!"
16.5,"Boult to Williamson, no run","low full toss outside off, and KW had shuffled across to the off side to try and ramp it over fine leg. But all he can do is toe end it back to Boult"
16.4,"Boult to Pandey, 1 run","full toss on off stump, and Pandey gets his front foot out of the way to mistime it towards cow corner. Only a single this time"
16.3,"Boult to Pandey, 2 runs","low full toss outside off, and Pandey mistimes it off his toe end towards wide long on. Hit so poorly, that it actually helps him take the second run"
16.2,"Boult to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, full on leg stump, and all KW can do is lift it over cover to the man in the deep"
16.1,"Boult to Pandey, 1 run","full on middle stump, and it's been driven inside out to long off. Boult took the pace off the delivery this time"
15.6,"Avesh Khan to Williamson, 2 runs","short outside off, and carved to the man at deep point. It's a dangerous second run, but the throw from the deep is poor. Time out as well"
15.5,"Avesh Khan to Williamson, SIX runs","too short outside off, and Williamson shuffles across to the off side to meet it on the up. Ramps it over backward point, and hey, it's gone all the way!"
15.4,"Avesh Khan to Pandey, 1 run","waist-high full toss on middle stump. Pandey uncomfortably whips it off his hips behind square. Looked like it was going for four, but backward square does well to keep it down to one"
15.3,"Avesh Khan to Pandey, no run","very short outside off, and had the width to be sent over point. But just the extra pace does Manish in. Can't get bat to ball"
15.2,"Avesh Khan to Williamson, 1 run","short outside off, and he's quick to swivel and pull. Dragged from way outside off, sent to the deep midwicket boundary"
15.1,"Avesh Khan to Williamson, no run","good length outside off, but slightly slower. Mistimes his backfoot punch towards cover"
14.6,"Christian to Pandey, FOUR runs","width offered, and slapped past point! Just that extra pace from Christian, and Pandey makes full use. Cuts it square to the end over in a strong manner"
14.5,"Christian to Pandey, FOUR runs","Long off asks long on to field it, and long on asks long off to collect! It was a low full toss on middle stump, that Pandey hit over the bowler's head. Both pull out off the dive and they can't believe it's gone for four. Boult and Roy the guilty men"
14.4,"Christian to Williamson, 1 run","good length on middle, but he's done well to take the pace off. Williamson attempts a leg-side drag, but the ball hits his helmet and goes to square leg"
14.3,"Christian to Pandey, 1 run","good length on off, and Pandey comes shimmying down the wicket. Muscles this pull, but it only goes to the man at long on"
14.2,"Christian to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball yorker on leg stump. Williamson backed away towards the leg side, and eventually manages to squeeze it towards square leg. An excellent delivery"
14.1,"Christian to Williamson, 2 runs","full just outside off stump. He walks across to the off side, and flicks it off his toes to the deep midwicket boundary. Man in the deep does well to intercept"
13.6,"Plunkett to Pandey, no run","offcutter, full outside off. Forces Pandey to get onto the front foot, but all he can do is defend it back to Plunkett"
13.5,"Plunkett to Williamson, 1 run","short outside off, and that's been pulled over square leg. Almost a boundary, but Vijay Shankar cleans up"
13.4,"Plunkett to Williamson, 2 runs","good length on middle stump, and Williamson comes down the wicket to tap it towards cover point (Boult). The throw from there is awry at the non-striker's, and that allows SRH to steal another run."
13.3,"Plunkett to Pandey, 1 run","almost chopped on! Back of a leg outside off, and he tried to push at it away from his body. The ball jags in, and takes the inside of his blade. Goes to fine leg eventually"
13.2,"Plunkett to Williamson, 1 run","super slow, but short outside off. KW has to wait ages, before swiping it from over his head and to the man at deep midwicket"
13.1,"Plunkett to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, and punched off the back foot to the man at extra cover"
12.6,"Mishra to Pandey, 1 run","good length on middle, and straightens after pitching. Slight adjustment from Pandey, as he gets inside the line of the ball, and then simply nudges it towards square leg"
12.5,"Mishra to Williamson, 1 run","flatter on off stump. It zips straight through, but he's quick to gauge the length. Goes deep into his crease and flat-bats it to long on"
12.4,"Mishra to Pandey, 1 run","tossed up, wide outside off. He takes a big stride and drives it square. Maxwell in the deep cleans up"
12.3,"Mishra to Williamson, 1 run","full on middle, and that's been swept! Down on one knee, and sent to the man at the fine-leg boundary"
12.2,"Mishra to Williamson, no run","full on middle, and the straight drive almost goes into Mishra's hands. Hit very straight and the bowler did well to get his body behind the ball's line"
12.1,"Mishra to Williamson, no run","good length on leg stump, and Williamson smothers this off the back foot. Played to square leg"
11.6,"Plunkett to Williamson, 1 run","short outside off, but not fast enough. Chops it down to third man"
11.5,"Plunkett to Pandey, 1 run","slower ball, wide outside off. Slightly short, so the batsman has to ride the bounce. Mistimes a cut towards cover point on this occasion"
11.4,"Plunkett to Pandey, 2 runs","good length on off stump, and Pandey taps it to the area near mid on. No one there, so that's a comfortable double"
11.3,"Plunkett to Pandey, no run","in the air, but just short of the bower! Back of a length outside off, and it hurries onto the batsman. Tries to defend, but comes off the bat's top half. Pandey stays alive because he played at it with soft hands"
11.3,"Plunkett to Pandey, 1 wide","short on off, and sends Pandey ducking for cover. Does well to get away from the ball's line, but it's way too high"
11.2,"Plunkett to Williamson, 1 run","good length outside off, and angling into KW's body. Opens his bat's face and runs it down to third man"
11.1,"Plunkett to Williamson, no run",good length but wide outside off. Williamson's gonna be disappointed not to put it away. Cut straight to point
10.6,"Mishra to S Dhawan, OUT","The extra ball fetches him the wicket! How rare is that. Flighted on middle, and Dhawan tried to slog sweep. It's the one that goes straight through and crashes into middle stump. Mishy-bhai is pumped!"
10.6,"Mishra to S Dhawan, 1 wide","good length on middle, and turning into Dhawan. Misses the leg-side flick"
10.5,"Mishra to Williamson, 1 run","full on leg stump, and that's been nudged to the vacant mid-wicket region. Allows them an easy single"
10.4,"Mishra to Williamson, no run","flighted full outside off. Slight legspin, and Williamson defends towards cover"
10.3,"Mishra to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length just outside off, stays on the back foot and slaps it to the man at deep extra cover"
10.2,"Mishra to Williamson, 1 run","good length outside off, and plays this legspin down the ground. Punched past the non-striker this time"

9.6,"Christian to Williamson, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and the ball stays low! He drags a pull along the ground to deep backward square. They walk across for the run"
9.5,"Christian to S Dhawan, 1 run","full outside off, and pushed past the cover fielder to Maxwell in the deep"
9.4,"Christian to S Dhawan, no run",full just outside off and that's been tapped off the front foot to cover. Man there
9.3,"Christian to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, on middle stump. Waits for it, before working it off his pads to square leg. Gets off the mark"
9.2,"Christian to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length, but wide outside off. Allows Dhawan to free his arms, and he cuts it to Avesh at deep point"
9.1,"Christian to S Dhawan, 2 runs","back of a length outside off, but angling into his body. Drags it behind square on the leg side, and some more work for Shaw in the deep"
8.6,"Mishra to Hales, OUT","a beauty! Ball of the tournament. Good length on leg stump, and spins across Hales' body as he tries to defend. He's on the back foot, and the ball whooshes past his outside edge, and crashes into off stump. A legspinner's dream ball. Time out"
8.5,"Mishra to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length on middle, and spinning into Dhawan. He shuffles across to the leg side and pushes towards long off"
8.4,"Mishra to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","full toss on leg stump, and that's been put away! Quick bat speed, and swept towards the backward square boundary"
8.3,"Mishra to Hales, 1 run","full just outside off, and that's been smashed past Mishra's left. Long off patrolling the boundary"
8.2,"Mishra to S Dhawan, 1 run","short on middle, and no real spin this time. Allows Dhawan to stay on the back foot and pull towards deep midwicket"

7.1,"Christian to S Dhawan, 1 run",swats this short delivery to deep midwicket
6.6,"Mishra to Hales, no run",beaten by a tossed up googly that spins back in to beat the inside edge and hit the flap of the pad.

6.4,"Mishra to Hales, no run","drifts in from wide of the crease, defended to the leg side"

6.1,"Mishra to S Dhawan, 1 run","shortish on middle, punched to long on"

5.5,"Avesh Khan to Hales, no run","mistimes a forceful hit down the ground, straight to mid on"
5.4,"Avesh Khan to Hales, SIX runs",this is terrific! Inside-out over long off. Not too full but he lofted it through the line. Sunrisers raise the half-century stand. Super expensive over and we still have two deliveries. This is Hales unleashed
5.3,"Avesh Khan to Hales, SIX runs","stunning! How quickly did he pick the length there? Fetched it from outside off and pull it imperiously in front of square. Bowled at 144kph, went to the ropes at 200. Delightful"
5.2,"Avesh Khan to S Dhawan, 1 run","another pull, this time he gets it high on the bat but manages to hit this wide of short fine leg"
5.1,"Avesh Khan to S Dhawan, SIX runs","this has been clobbered deep into the stands at backward square leg. Sat up nicely, Dhawan swivelled back and allowed his wrists to create magic! The release shot. Will we see a different Dhawan from now?"
5.1,"Avesh Khan to Hales, (no ball) 1 run","oh, dear. Oversteps as he bowls this full delivery that is defended back. Huge roar around the ground as the umpire calls it a  freehit "
4.6,"Plunkett to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","very poor from Plunkett. Too short and angling down, Dhawan helps this down past short fine leg. He'll put those away in his sleep. Not the kind of ball you want to be bowling to someone who has a highest of 11 in his last five innings!"
4.5,"Plunkett to Hales, 1 run","controls the pull to keep this all along the ground, down to deep square"
4.4,"Plunkett to S Dhawan, 1 run","drags this pull from way outside off to square leg, no timing again."
4.3,"Plunkett to Hales, 1 run","backs away but Plunkett follows him by bowling one fuller, worked to midwicket"

2.6,"Boult to S Dhawan, 1 run",works this full delivery on middle to mid on for a quick single
2.6,"Boult to Hales, 2 wide","flies down leg, Pant fumbles and they'll get an extra run apart from the wide. Wrong line from Boult"
2.5,"Boult to Hales, 2 runs","slower and fuller outside off, he leans into the drive and gets this behind point. Square third man comes around to cut that off"
2.4,"Boult to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower and fuller outside off, driven firmly but only as far as mid off"
2.3,"Boult to S Dhawan, no run",deflects off the thigh to slip. Cramped for room by a length ball as he tried to work it to the legside

1.5,"Avesh Khan to S Dhawan, no run","back of length angling away, plays inside the line as this whizzes past."
1.4,"Avesh Khan to Hales, 1 run"," Oh, dear. Maxwell! What have you done?  Will that prove to be the difference? Straight in, straight out at deep square leg. Avesh hits the deck hard again with this short ball, rushed onto Hales as he pulled from outside off, got more elevation than distance. Maxwell came running in, trembled and never looked like taking it as it descended. Gosh!"
1.3,"Avesh Khan to Hales, FOUR runs","clever, very clever. Made room to slap this over point but Avesh cramped him for room. Hales now changes his stroke and uses the pace to help this wide of short third man."
1.2,"Avesh Khan to Hales, no run",beaten for pace! Shapes to pull from outside off but played too late.
1.1,"Avesh Khan to Hales, FOUR runs",helps the pull over Mishra at short fine. Too short and angling in from wide of the crease and he was ready for this.

19.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Shankar, 3 runs","hip-high full toss on leg stump, band that's been flicked off his pads to the backward square boundary. Not a no ball, but they still manage to take three. Delhi Daredevils finish on 163!"
19.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Shankar, FOUR runs","offcutter outside off, but just too wide this time. He shuffles across to the off side, and cuts it in the gap. Deep point does well to get to the ball, but just can't parry it back"
19.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Christian, 1 run","short outside off, and Bhuvi's also taken the pace off this. Christian flat-bats it over Shankar, but lands well short of long on"

19.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Shankar, SIX runs","down on one knee, and over long on! Overpitched outside off, and Shankar shanks it into the stands. Perfect spot for him to free his arms"
19.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Shankar, 2 runs","back of a length outside off, and that's been worked off his hips to Dhawan at deep midwicket. Gently played by Shankar, which allows them to return for the second"
18.6,"Kaul to Shankar, 1 run","full and wide outside off, but Shankar gets his bat to ball and taps this towards point. Would've gone for four if it wasn't for Sandeep's diving effort near the 15-year circle"
18.5,"Kaul to Christian, 1 run","muscled to long off! But men patrolling the deep. Full outside off,and that was mistimed over Kaul's head"
18.4,"Kaul to Shankar, 1 run","full just outside off, and that's been driven to Williamson at cover. The non-striker is stranded midway, and KW aims at the stumps. He misses the wicket, and Kaul - in front of the stumps - can't grab it either"
18.3,"Kaul to Shankar, 2 runs","slower ball, and short outside off. Checks his pull, but still manages to hit it well to the cow-corner boundary. Rashid is excellent in the deep"

17.2,"Shakib to Christian, no run","fair play! Full on off, and that was drilled straight into the non-striker's stumps. The umpire wants a replay in case the non-striker is run out, but Shakib says he hasn't touched the ball. Good to see"

16.6,"Rashid Khan to Christian, 1 run","overpitched on leg stump, and Christian pushes it into the gap in front of midwicket. He'll keep strike"
16.5,"Rashid Khan to Pant, OUT","big appeal! And that's the slow finger of death. He's reviewing, but looks half-hearted. Was short on middle, and Pant just couldn't connect with the pull. The ball snuck under his bat, and hit his back leg. Looks kinda high though. Could miss the stumps, but alas! Would've clipped top of middle stump."
16.4,"Rashid Khan to Shankar, 1 run","wrong'un! Outside off, and spinning into his pads. Flicked to the midwicket boundary"
16.3,"Rashid Khan to Shankar, no run","good length, just outside off. Spinning away from Shankar, and he fends it away towards point"
16.2,"Rashid Khan to Shankar, no run","good length outside off, and sharp spin away from his body. Tapped off the back foot to point, and gets off the mark as well"
16.1,"Rashid Khan to Ojha, OUT","yes, no, yes, no, out! Full just on off, and he pushes the wrong'un towards the non-striker. Ojha wants to get off strike, but Pant chooses not to carry on after starting off. Ojha's stranded, and Rashid collects and throws at the batsman's end. Saha does the rest "
15.6,"Kaul to Pant, FOUR runs","knuckle ball just outside off, and not too wide this time. Pant manageds to reach at it, and bunts it over Kaul's head. Not him well enough, but still sent the umpire scampering for cover"
15.5,"Kaul to Ojha, 1 leg bye","yorker on middle and leg, and the batsman does well to get his toes out of the way. Late inswing, and that hits his boot"

15.4,"Kaul to Pant, 1 wide","back of a length outside off, and forces Pant to reach at it. It's been a strategy against Pant, but this is too wide"

15.2,"Kaul to Ojha, no run","back of a length on middle, and aimed at the batsman's body. Cramped for space, and can only tap it away towards the leg side"
15.1,"Kaul to Iyer, OUT","full on the pads and he's flicked this straight to Dhawan at deep midwicket. Out comes the Kabaddi thump. Oh, dear. Iyer has thrown it away."
14.6,"Sandeep to Iyer, 1 run",pulled from outside off to deep midwicket
14.5,"Sandeep to Iyer, FOUR runs"," Dhawan has made a right royal mess at long off.  The harbour bridge as they'd call it in Australia. Iyer belted this full toss down to long off, Dhawan failed to bend down properly. What should've been a single is now four."
14.4,"Sandeep to Pant, 1 run",rolls his wrists nicely to play this half pull from outside off to deep square leg
14.3,"Sandeep to Pant, no run","slogs and misses. Through the stroke early, beaten completely by this slower delivery."
14.2,"Sandeep to Pant, no run","loses his timing. Tries to whack this length ball across the line, gets an inside edge back to the bowler."
14.1,"Sandeep to Iyer, 1 run","lucky to get away with a juicy full toss, punched to long on"
13.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, 2 runs","belts this full delivery to Pandey at long off, this time they hare back for the second. Almost as if Iyer said ""don't care what you do, just get back."""
13.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Iyer, 1 run","punches this length ball on the up to long off. Iyer wanted the second, Pant didn't. Cry of anguish from the skipper. Remember the run out from the other night?"

12.5,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, 1 run",dabs this gently into the off side for a quick single
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, SIX runs","now he adds insult to injury. This is a magnificent loft over extra cover. Picked the legbreak off the hand, wasn't underneath the flight but hit this on the up and this sailed away. Wow"

11.3,"Kaul to Iyer, no run","looks to arch back and upper cut this short delivery, beaten by the zip"
11.2,"Kaul to Iyer, no run",has he gloved this? Big appeal but the umpire is unmoved. Iyer looks to hop across and whip this but misses. The ball may have brushed his thigh pad on the way
11.1,"Kaul to Pant, 1 run","back of length outside off, he stands tall and punches to deep cover"
10.6,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run",uppish but safe! This stopped on Pant as he looked to punch towards midwicket

8.5,"Shakib to Iyer, 1 run","flatter on middle and leg, worked to square leg"

8.3,"Shakib to Iyer, no run","slow turn from length on middle, defended back"

6.1,"Shakib to Iyer, 1 run",thumped inside out to deep extra cover.
5.6,"Kaul to Shaw, FOUR runs","back of a length outside off, and he punches it off the back foot. Beats the man at cover, and Rashid's dive at the boundary is futile. Big finish to the Powerplay"
5.5,"Kaul to Shaw, FOUR runs","quicker, on middle stump. It's angling down the leg side however, and all Shaw has to do is drag it fine. Flicked very fine, and between the keeper and short third man. Hat-trick of boundaries"
5.4,"Kaul to Shaw, FOUR runs","good length on middle stump, and this time Shaw pulls it over midwicket! Swivels well, and then his bat speed does the rest. Picking the length early"

3.6,"Sandeep to Shaw, FOUR runs","slower ball on leg stump, and he knew where the fielders were! Shuffles across to the off side, and drags a safe pull along the ground. Beats short third man, and that's four to end the over"

1.5,"Sandeep to Shaw, FOUR runs","slapped square! Outside off, and Shaw rides the bounce to cut it off the back foot. Between backward point and point"
1.5,"Sandeep to Shaw, 1 wide","full on middle and leg, but it's the slower ball. Goes down the leg side"
1.4,"Sandeep to Shaw, OUT","Is Maxwell out? Yes!  How unlucky would he have to be? It was full on middle stump, and Shaw drove it straight to Sandeep. The bowler managed to get fingertips to it, and it ricocheted onto his boots and then onto the stumps. Maxwell's too slow to react, and he's inches short of the ground."
1.3,"Sandeep to Shaw, SIX runs","over long on! What a talent. Good length outside off, and in Shaw's arc to smack this straight. Hits it through the ball's line, and thumps it over the bowler's head"

1.1,"Sandeep to Maxwell, no run","good length outside off, and takes the extra bounce! Maxwell's a tall man, though, so he comfortably fends it away with soft hands"

0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, 1 run","back of a length on off. Seams slightly away from Maxwell, so he pushes it off the back foot to mid off. Calls early for the single, and they've scampered across easily. But Maxwell tripped while completing the run. He looks slightly hurt"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, 1 run","full on off, and swinging into Shaw. Mistimes an on drive to the midwicket region. They're off the mark"
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, no run","full and wide outside off. He wants Shaw to reach at it, but the batsman pulls out of the shot midway. Lets it go through to the keeper"

But then drops the ball into play before going beyond the fence. Then comes back and pouches it with both hands. Raina hangs at the edge of the straight boundary, but he has to go. The TV umpire confirms that's a clean catch. Well done, Southee. Umesh banged it short and outside off, Raina, having backed away outside leg, attempts a pull and ends up dragging a catch.

18.4,"Tye to Krunal, 1 run","a slower short delivery on middle, pulled to deep midwicket"
18.3,"Tye to Krunal, SIX runs","definitely done now. Length on off., Krunal launches a slog into the stands at deep midwicket. Defending at this ground is so hard."
18.2,"Tye to Krunal, FOUR runs","four more. A slower delivery outside off, Krunal was well and truly beaten by that delivery, but he improvised so well. Waited and waited and then carved the ball in the air, but past point."
18.1,"Tye to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, flat-batted away to long-on"
17.6,"Stoinis to Krunal, SIX runs","that's the game done! That was an awful delivery, on middle and leg. Krunal backs away and slogs the ball with ease over long-on. 20 runs off that over, and Mumbai should have no trouble from here."
17.5,"Stoinis to Krunal, FOUR runs","put away for four. A low full toss down leg, can't bowl full tosses at this time. Flicked away through backward square leg for four. Easily done."
17.4,"Stoinis to Krunal, FOUR runs","powered past cover for four more. A slower ball outside off, Krunal clears his front leg and clatters a powerful drive through cover"
17.3,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, tapped towards point for a run"
17.2,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","eased away for four. A slower ball outside off, Rohit just times that drive past cover, like he's batting in the nets against net bowlers."
17.1,"Stoinis to Krunal, 1 run","a good length delivery on middle, hit away to long-on from the crease. Hurried on the shot."
16.6,"Mujeeb to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","finishes the over with six! A dart on the pads from Mujeeb, Rohit runs at him with immense self-confidence and flicks him over midwicket for six. All timing, fantastic stroke-making"
16.5,"Mujeeb to Krunal, 1 run","very well bowled. The yorker on leg, jammed out to long-on"
16.4,"Mujeeb to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","goes short, but it's a googly. Down leg. Pulled away to deep square leg."
16.3,"Mujeeb to Rohit Sharma, no run","the googly down leg, Rohit misses a slog sweep. Struck on the pad, sliding down. Two dots after six."
16.2,"Mujeeb to Rohit Sharma, no run","87 kph, short and wide outside off, carved to backward point"
16.1,"Mujeeb to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","a straight six! Flat and straight, and that same error again, it's full. Rohit clears his front leg and launches this over long-on for six."
15.6,"Tye to Krunal, no run","back of a length on middle, 130 kph, punched back to the bowler."
15.5,"Tye to Krunal, no run","a full delivery outside off, chopped back towards the keeper as he tried to guide that to third man."
15.4,"Tye to Krunal, FOUR runs","oh lovely timing from Krunal. Full on middle and leg, he just flicked that in the gap. His strong wrists and gap placement earns him four."
15.4,"Tye to Krunal, 1 wide",strays down leg for a wide.
15.3,"Tye to Pandya, OUT","127 kph, goes through Hardik! It's a slower ball on middle, think he disguised that ball excellently. Because Pandya saw the length, picked the right shot (a wild T20 heave, what else?) but was through his shot too early. The ball then had an unhindered path to the middle stump. Lovely execution."
15.2,"Tye to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","a slower ball on leg, flicked away uppishly to long-on. Excellent timing on that"
15.1,"Tye to Pandya, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, 114 kph, may have been the knuckle ball. Tapped to short third man for a quick single."
14.6,"Mujeeb to Rohit Sharma, no run","98 kph, flat and straight, defended back. Don't think Ro minds those dots."
14.5,"Mujeeb to Rohit Sharma, no run","the googly on middle, chopped to cover"
14.4,"Mujeeb to Pandya, 1 run","a slower offbreak there. Hardik backed away, aiming to go straight again, but a thick inside edge to deep square leg."
14.3,"Mujeeb to Pandya, no run","shortish and wide, Hardik picks out Yuvraj at cover point."
14.2,"Mujeeb to Pandya, SIX runs","again, the error of bowling that full. It's right in the hitting arc, Hardik backs away and goes boom. A straight six over long-on. Very high elbow."
14.1,"Mujeeb to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, chopped towards backward point for one, like Karun and Yuvraj in the first innings. But Hardik is much quicker and makes it with time to spare."
13.6,"Tye to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full outside off, dabbed down to short third man for a quick single. Hardik's sprint carries him through."
13.5,"Tye to Pandya, 1 run","back of a length on middle and leg, punched to long-on"
13.4,"Tye to Pandya, 2 runs","Stoinis misfields again! Full and wide outside off, sliced away to deep point. A fumble, two more"
13.3,"Tye to Pandya, FOUR runs","eeh. Stoinis lets that go through. Full and wide outside off, drilled away to the sweeper cover. Stoinis over-runs it, running to his right, and the ball spins past him with a grin"
13.2,"Tye to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","a slower delivery to start, nudged to deep square leg. Gayle first misfields, then recovers quickly, then engages in some Gayle theatrics."
13.1,"Tye to Pandya, 1 run","a full delivery on off, punched to long-off"
12.6,"Mujeeb to Ishan, OUT","he strikes! It was the slider, came down again but the ball was much flatter and shorter. Kishan runs down, and is nowhere near the pitch. That means the ball has enough room to turn, it finds a big gap between bat and pad to knock into the stumps."
12.5,"Mujeeb to Ishan, SIX runs","slog-swept, T20'd away over midwicket. Kishan trusts his form and instinct, saw some flight and decided early, smashed over midwicket"
12.4,"Mujeeb to Pandya, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, carved away towards extra cover for a run"
12.3,"Mujeeb to Pandya, FOUR runs","smashed for four into the gap at midwicket. Flat around middle, Hardik thrashes that with ease"
12.2,"Mujeeb to Ishan, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, slapped to long-off. One more."
12.1,"Mujeeb to Pandya, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, flat-batted to deep cover"
11.6,"Stoinis to Ishan, SIX runs","top-edged for six! Back of a length on middle, the bouncer. Not the worst delivery, it took Kishan by surprise. But it's always a risk for this exact reason. A leading edge flies over fine leg."
11.5,"Stoinis to Pandya, 1 run","a low full toss on middle and leg, drilled to long-on for one."
11.4,"Stoinis to Yadav, OUT","the swervy knuckle ball does the trick for Stoinis. A length knuckle ball outside off, the ball moves away. Suryakumar swings across the line but the ball takes the leading edge and lobs towards Rahul. He swerves into position and takes the swirler. Excellent bowling"
11.3,"Stoinis to Yadav, no run","a knuckle ball? Full and wide outside off, Suryakumar misses a cut."
11.2,"Stoinis to Yadav, no run","131 kph, full and wide outside off, driven to mid-off. A slip and a stumble from the non-striker as he turns back, but there is also a fumble"
11.1,"Stoinis to Yadav, FOUR runs","a low full toss down leg, flicked away with immense power into the gap at square leg. The fielder runs to his left, but has no chance."
10.6,"Ashwin to Ishan, no run","looks for the switch hit, but he gets just enough bat to short third man. Flat and wide outside off, helped along."
10.5,"Ashwin to Ishan, SIX runs","Kishan gets going. A flat delivery on middle and leg, Kishan stays low and slog sweeps the ball against the turn, T20 style. Over midwicket"
10.4,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","flat and wide, slapped to deep cover for a run"
10.3,"Ashwin to Yadav, no run","Rahul misses a stumping! A carrom ball down leg, Suryakumar looks to launch that over midwicket but misses the variation. Rahul fumbles the collection even as Suryakumar is scrambling to get back"

10.1,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, punched away to deep cover"
9.6,"Rajpoot to Ishan, no run","off the glove, but falls short of Rahul. Back of a length down leg, Kishan is hurried on a pull and all he can manage is a bit of glove"
9.5,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, carved away towards backward point"
9.4,"Rajpoot to Yadav, FOUR runs","four more. Short and wide this time, carved away through backward point for four. Suryakumar's great form continues, his third IPL fifty this season"
9.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, SIX runs","full and wide outside off, Suryakumar goes straight and very, very long. Got that off the bottom of the bat, but bats these days means it was never going to be caught. Huge straight six."
9.2,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run","back of a length outside off, hit to cover from the crease. Vital dots these."
9.1,"Rajpoot to Ishan, 1 run",a slower ball on leg. chopped away towards point for a run.
8.6,"Stoinis to Ishan, 1 run","overpitched just outside off, but defended to cover off the front foot. Sees the over out carefully before the mandatory time out"
8.5,"Stoinis to Ishan, no run","good length on off, and going across hid body. Tried to drive it square but through to Rahul in no time!"
8.4,"Stoinis to Yadav, 1 run","full on off stump, and flicked off his pads to deep midwicket for a walking single"
8.3,"Stoinis to Yadav, no run","full on middle stump, and he can't flick towards the leg side. Appeal for lbw turned down. Would've gone down leg"
8.2,"Stoinis to Yadav, no run","back of a length outside off, and gets into Yadav's body. Hits his gut as he tries to defend"
8.1,"Stoinis to Yadav, FOUR runs","starts off with the slower ball, and that's been muscled straight to the long-on boundary. A juicy first delivery that Suryakumar helps for four"
7.6,"Axar Patel to Ishan, no run","good length on middle, and he gets down on one knee to paddle sweep. Straight to short fine leg"
7.5,"Axar Patel to Yadav, 1 run","full just outside off, and driven straight to long on for a walking single"
7.4,"Axar Patel to Ishan, 1 run",good length outside off and spinning into Axar. Cut furiously off the back foot to the man in the deep
7.3,"Axar Patel to Ishan, 2 runs","good length outside off, and zipping straight through. Kishan taps it well towards the wide long-on boundary, and finally manages to get off the mark"
7.2,"Axar Patel to Yadav, 1 run","good length just outside off, and that's been worked off his legs towards the mid-wicket boundary"
7.1,"Axar Patel to Yadav, FOUR runs","full on off, but he's quick to get down on one knee and whip this behind square leg. Full swing of the bat"
6.6,"Ashwin to Ishan, no run","good length on off, and grips & turns away from Kishan. Tries to defend but takes the outside edge. Falls safe however"

5.5,"Mujeeb to Ishan, no run",wrong'un to start off. Full outside off and spinning away from him. Defended off the front foot
5.4,"Mujeeb to Lewis, OUT","Rahul holds on! Short outside off, but going straight. Lewis tried to cut, but he hits it straight into Rahul's open gloves. Excellent take"
5.3,"Mujeeb to Lewis, no run","good length on off and zipping straight through. Trapped in front of middle stump, but the lbw appeal is turned down. Too high, one thinks"
5.2,"Mujeeb to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length on off, and angling into Sky. Cramped, but manages to nudge it towards mid on"
5.1,"Mujeeb to Yadav, no run","full just outside off, and driven hard to cover. Man placed there however"
4.6,"Tye to Lewis, no run","yorker wide outside off, and Lewis chops it towards short third man"
4.5,"Tye to Yadav, 1 run","slower ball, full on off. He watches carefully and pushes it off the front foot to mid off. Nice, early call for one"
4.4,"Tye to Yadav, no run","good length on middle, and he can only tap it towards mid on this time. Man there"
4.3,"Tye to Yadav, no run","knuckle again, but wiiide outside off. Forces him to reach at it, and mistimes the cut to point"
4.2,"Tye to Yadav, no run","of course he bowls the knuckleball next delivery. Good length outside off, but Suryakumar's through his drive too early. Misses, and goes to the keeper on the bounce"
4.1,"Tye to Yadav, FOUR runs","slapped in front of cover! Wide outside off, and Sky rides the bounce and muscles it towards the extra-cover boundary. Good start to the over"
3.6,"Rajpoot to Lewis, no run","back of a length outside off, pushed to cover point"
3.5,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length outside off, pushed away to mid-on for a quick single. Suryakumar judged that run very well. There is a direct hit at the bowler's end, but Ravi doesn't go to the third umpire. Excellent umpiring, got into position early to make that decision"
3.4,"Rajpoot to Yadav, FOUR runs","a slower ball on middle and leg, Suryakumar just tucks the ball into the gap. A half push. And he finds the gap at midwicket for four. Excellent execution."
3.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run","back of a length outside off, punched away to cover from the back foot"
3.2,"Rajpoot to Yadav, SIX runs",strays on the pads and Suryakumar lofts the ball over deep backward square leg with a swivel of the wrists. All wrists.

2.6,"Ashwin to Lewis, 1 run","on the pads, worked away to deep midwicket for one"

2.3,"Ashwin to Lewis, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, chopped towards point"

2.1,"Ashwin to Lewis, 1 run","flat and straight, nudged away to deep midwicket for one"
1.6,"Rajpoot to Yadav, SIX runs","a flat six! Just over the deep square leg fielder. A short delivery around leg, pulled away towards Agarwal on the boundary. He leaps, but the ball is just too high"

1.4,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run","back of a length outside off, moving away, punched to point from the crease."
1.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run","big appeal from Rahul. No, says umpire Ravi. But Rahul is keen, and convinces Ashwin to use up Kings XI's only review. There is some noise, but looks like pad. Back of a length down leg, Suryakumar misses a flick, the ball takes the trouser en route to the keeper."
1.2,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run","a full delivery outside off, more away swing. Left alone neatly"
1.1,"Rajpoot to Lewis, 1 run","skiddy. Some swing too. Good length outside off, the ball moving in. Lewis chops a punch into the ground, towards gully"

19.6,"Pandya to Stoinis, FOUR runs","four to finish. A slower ball on middle and leg, smashed away into the gap at midwicket. 22 off the last over, Kings XI will take that."
19.5,"Pandya to Stoinis, SIX runs","six! 133 kph, a short delivery around off, Stoinis backs away and slices the ball intentionally over short third man. Not the worst delivery, but that's a very good shot."
19.4,"Pandya to Agarwal, OUT","good catch. A slower ball outside off, Agarwal backs away. The ball is wide outside off, so he isn't balanced at point of contact. The ball slices away, third man runs back and takes a good, well-judged catch"
19.3,"Pandya to Stoinis, 1 run","a short slower ball outside off, hit away to long-off. Stoinis isn't happy with the execution."
19.2,"Pandya to Stoinis, FOUR runs","swatted into the gap at midwicket. A short delivery around middle and leg, pulled away into the gap at midwicket"
19.1,"Pandya to Stoinis, SIX runs","seven off the first ball. Full outside off, Stoinis gets underneath the length and gets enough to clear long-off. Not the best of timing, but enough"
19.1,"Pandya to Stoinis, 1 wide","yikes! A wideeeee delivery outside off, did that even land on the pitch?"
18.6,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run","back of a length outside off, carved to deep point. That is an awesome spell, 1 for 19 in these batting-friendly conditions."
18.5,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 2 runs","back of a length, short delivery. Stoinis splices a pull with awful timing towards long-on for two."
18.4,"Bumrah to Agarwal, 1 run","full around off, smashed away to long-off"
18.3,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run","a good length delivery on off, chipped to deep midwicket for one"

17.6,"Cutting to Agarwal, 1 run","a slower legcutter on off, worked to deep midwicket. Decent over for Mumbai."
17.5,"Cutting to Agarwal, SIX runs","just over long-off. A slower ball again outside off, Agarwal looks to hit the ball over cover but the bat face closes again. He still has just enough timing and power to clear long-off"

16.6,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run","full around leg, worked to midwicket"
16.5,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, OUT","chipped to Hardik Pandya at long-on! Kings XI stuttering here. Another good slower ball, on middle and leg, an offcutter. Axar Patel tries to hit the ball straight and does so well. But the pace off the ball was responsible for the ball being chipped instead of hit. Easy catch."
16.4,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run","on the pads, worked away to deep square leg"
16.3,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 leg bye","a low full toss down leg, Axar misses a flick, struck on the pad. Bumrah appeals, but no says the umpire. One leg bye towards midwicket"
16.2,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run","out with a direct hit. On the pads, worked to midwicket. The fielder picks up, takes aim and misses at the bowler's end."
16.1,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run","back of a length on off, 136 kph. Stoinis blocks back."
15.6,"McClenaghan to Nair, OUT","taken at long-off. A slower ball around off, Karun Nair looks to loft that over cover but he doesn't quite hit the ball well enough. The bat turns in his hands and the ball takes the inside half. Lobs to Hardik Pandya, running around to his left from long-off."
15.5,"McClenaghan to Axar Patel, 1 run",smashed away down to long-off for one
15.4,"McClenaghan to Axar Patel, no run","McClenaghan misses! A massive chance, he should be hitting the stumps from there. Good length on off, a thick inside edge ricochets to cover via the pad. Nair runs down and is sent back. McClenaghan takes aim and misses at the bowler's end"

14.6,"Markande to Axar Patel, 1 run","a googly on middle and off, tapped quietly to point for one."
14.5,"Markande to Nair, 1 run",the googly down leg. Nair works it down to fine leg. Would have been wide had he left the ball.
14.4,"Markande to Nair, no run","lots of flight around middle and off, pushed back to the bowler"
14.3,"Markande to Axar Patel, 1 run","a googly outside off, worked to deep midwicket"
14.2,"Markande to Axar Patel, SIX runs","massive. A legbreak outside off, Axar gets underneath the length and lofts the ball cleanly and elegantly over long-on. Another big hit. The more you see shots like this, the more you think Kings XI are struggling here."
14.1,"Markande to Nair, 1 run",pushed straight down the ground for a run.
13.6,"Cutting to Nair, 1 run",pushed away into the gap at deep midwicket
13.5,"Cutting to Nair, 2 runs","another legcutter outside off, slashed to deep point. McClenaghan saves two with a well-timed dive."
13.4,"Cutting to Nair, SIX runs","swatted for six more. Another slower delivery, may have been the legcutter. Nair goes back and pulls into the gap at deep midwicket. A flat six."
13.3,"Cutting to Nair, FOUR runs","a back of a length delivery outside off, Nair walks across, looking to swivel-pull to deep square leg. A thick top edge flies over the keeper"

12.4,"Krunal to Axar Patel, 1 run","full outside off, punched to long-off"
12.3,"Krunal to Nair, OUT","Yuvraj is gone? He's walking back! Nair played that quietly towards point and called Yuvraj through for a non-existent single. The fielder at point runs in, throws the ball back to the keeper and Yuvraj is welllll short of the crease. In backyard cricket, when you want the other person to get out, you call them for a run that isn't there and just say, sorry mate, next batsman. That's how bad that call for a single was"
12.2,"Krunal to Yuvraj, 1 run","that's much quicker and straighter, flicked to deep square leg"
12.1,"Krunal to Yuvraj, SIX runs","smashed for six! Tosses that one up outside off, Yuvraj slog-sweeps that easily over midwicket for six. Easy as  "
11.6,"Cutting to Yuvraj, 1 run","length ball on the pads, worked away to midwicket"
11.5,"Cutting to Yuvraj, no run","lots of hesitation. Full and wide, carved to backward point. Yuvraj and Nair move forward, then backward, then forwards. Then Yuvraj and Nair both go back. Lots of miscommunication"
11.4,"Cutting to Gayle, OUT","a humongous wicket for Mumbai! A 40-ball 50 from Gayle. He doesn't look too happy. That was excellent bowling from Mumbai, taking pace off the ball, bowling outside his preferred hitting areas. He's frustrated and therefore has a hoick at a length offcutter on middle. The ball takes the outside half of the bat and splices to deep midwicket."
11.3,"Cutting to Gayle, no run","a shortish delivery outside off, 127 kph. Gayle lets that one go"
11.2,"Cutting to Yuvraj, 1 run",a shortish wide delivery is cut to deep point for one
11.1,"Cutting to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length on leg, worked to deep square leg. This is Gayle's fourth fifty-plus scores in five IPL 2018 games. Out comes the baby-rocking celebration"

10.3,"Duminy to Yuvraj, no run","a tossed up delivery on middle, blocked back."

10.1,"Duminy to Yuvraj, 1 run","a tossed up offbreak outside off, a languid drive to deep cover for a run. Long-off is much wider, not too straight"
9.6,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","a good delivery to end, the bouncer on leg. Gayle ducks underneath."
9.5,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","another slower delivery on middle and off, hits the pad. Pitched well outside the line"
9.4,"Pandya to Gayle, 4 leg byes",strays on the pads again. Not a bad line. But it's a full toss down leg. Gayle misses again. The ball ricochets to the fine leg boundary off the pad
9.3,"Pandya to Yuvraj, 1 run","dropped? A tough chance! Short and wide, Yuvraj under-edges the ball towards the keeper. Kishan dives to his left, gets there, but the ball pops out. A chance he should have taken, I feel"
9.2,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 run","strays down leg, cramping him for room. Worked to deep square leg"
9.1,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","a slower ball with enough cut on the ball. Gayle wanted to work the ball to square leg, but the ball went past the inside edge. That's a weird stroke"
8.6,"Markande to Gayle, 1 run",slog-sweeps the wide delivery to deep midwicket.
8.6,"Markande to Gayle, 1 wide","another wide googly, keeps very low. But outside the tramlines"
8.5,"Markande to Gayle, FOUR runs","it's a wide googly, the length is much better and makes Gayle play a difficult shot. He plays it well though. Slices the ball over backward point for four"
8.4,"Markande to Gayle, SIX runs","the error is that it's full. The line hardly matters in new-age T20s. It's full and wide, Gayle gets underneath the length and pummels a lofted drive over cover. Another very big hit."
8.3,"Markande to Yuvraj, 1 run","a legbreak on middle and leg, worked away with the spin to deep square leg for one"
8.2,"Markande to Yuvraj, no run",a googly outside off. Yuvi doesn't pick that and the ball beats the bat
8.1,"Markande to Gayle, 1 run","just short of third man! Flat and wide outside off, slashed away towards the fielder, the ball lands in front and ricochets away off the body"
7.6,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 run","another slower ball, down leg, worked away to deep midwicket. Very tidy over from Hardik"
7.5,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","no quick singles! A slower delivery outside off, pushed to cover, Gayle sends a laboured Yuvraj back, ironic."
7.4,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","there comes that shorter length. Back of a length outside off, angling away. Gayle watches that go to the keeper"
7.3,"Pandya to Yuvraj, 1 run","short and wide outside off, carved away to deep point for a run. Well timed"
7.2,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 run","length ball around leg, worked to deep square leg for a run"
7.1,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","136 kph, a fullish delivery on middle and leg, defended into the leg side. Don't see too many quick singles in this stand."
7.1,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 wide","a length delivery slips down leg, wide."
6.6,"Markande to Yuvraj, no run","nicely bowled. Yuvraj comes charging, but the googly spins away. An improvised block."
6.5,"Markande to Yuvraj, no run","a legbreak on off, defended back"
6.4,"Markande to Rahul, OUT","yikes! A googly on middle and leg, it's a filthy long-hop too. Rahul picks the length early, his eyes light up with six. He rocks back and mis-times a pull to deep midwicket. Picks out the fielder to perfection. Wow, those are six runs missed and he's out."
6.3,"Markande to Rahul, no run","the reverse sweep but he picks out short third man. Executes nicely, not quite placed well enough though"
6.2,"Markande to Rahul, FOUR runs","slog-swept for four through square leg. Too easy. He just gets across, stays low enough and nails the sweep into the gap. Fantastic shot."
6.1,"Markande to Gayle, 1 run","a googly, wide outside off. Smashed back, right through the hands of Markande as he dives to his right"
5.6,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","another slower ball, pushed to mid-off. Good end from Mumbai"
5.5,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run",defends a length ball back. That's a win for Mumbai because Gayle won't bat more in the Powerplay
5.4,"McClenaghan to Gayle, 1 run","115 kph, another slower ball, and straight. Inside edged towards leg gully for a run."
5.3,"McClenaghan to Gayle, FOUR runs","113 kph, a slower straight ball is chipped over mid-off. Almost carries the distance, for six. Lands just inside."
5.2,"McClenaghan to Gayle, SIX runs","out the stadium! Back of a length on middle and off, Gayle was waiting for that, like the first ball. He stays back and goes baaaang! Way over square leg. How long? Looks like 750 metres"
5.2,"McClenaghan to Gayle, 1 wide",a slower ball goes wrong. Wide down the leg side.
5.1,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run","slower ball on middle and leg, Gayle backed away, creating some room, but didn't anticipate that length. Eventually, he blocks."
4.6,"Bumrah to Gayle, 1 run","excellent end from Bumrah. Another well-executed yorker, played away to cover"
4.5,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","a nice yorker, or very full ball. Full and straight, pushed away to mid-on"
4.4,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run",a slower cutter outside off is carved away to backward point. A little more height or placed a few feet either side would have earned KL four.
4.3,"Bumrah to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length on the hips, nudged away to square leg for a run. Biding his time for now"
4.2,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run",well bowled! Attacks Gayle with the straight bouncer. Gayle ducks underneath that.
4.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","a slower ball on middle and leg, nudged down to fine leg, one more"
3.6,"Pandya to Gayle, FOUR runs","129 kph, carved over third man for four. Finding their fluency now. It's short and wider outside off, Gayle just slices the ball over short third man, like a tennis slice."
3.6,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 wide","the wide yorker goes wrong. Full and wide, but outside the tramlines"
3.5,"Pandya to Gayle, FOUR runs","a slower ball is scythed away through point for four. He carves the ball towards Cutting at cover point. He gets a hand on it, but the ball takes his hand en route to the boundary"
3.4,"Pandya to Gayle, FOUR runs","not quite in control, but he still manages to get enough power behind the stroke. It's full around off, he was setting for a short ball. His weight is on the back foot but he powers a straight drive"
3.3,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","yet another cutter, pace off the ball, nudged away to deep square leg"
3.2,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 run","another slower ball, on middle and off, clipped to deep square leg for a run."
3.1,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","starts with a slower ball around off, worked away to deep square leg for a single."
2.6,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run","back of a length outside off, guided away to backward point. Some pressure on Gayle, 1 off 8, but he likes to start slow and back himself against spin later."
2.5,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run","a short delivery that isn't quite straight. A bouncer outside off, Gayle lets that one go."
2.4,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run","another slower ball, on middle and leg, 123 kph, nudged away towards square leg for a tight run. Gayle says c'mon this time and it's an easy single."
2.3,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","a slower ball around off, 117 kph. Rahul punches to cover and calls for a non-existent single. Gayle tells him something along the lines of not quite a run there."
2.2,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","looks to go straight again, it's full around off. Rahul tries to loft that over the infield too. Gets a thick inside edge into the pad."
2.1,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","a slower delivery around off, defended with the full face of the bat."
1.6,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run","edged, but short of wide slip! 138 kph, a wide yorker outside off. Gayle gets a thick outside edge, with a slight angle of the bat. Short of Rohit, good stop"
1.5,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run","another slower one, good comeback from Bumrah this over. Defended to point"
1.4,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run","a slower delivery around middle and leg, gets some cut on his offcutter. A thick outside edge down to short third man."
1.3,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run","a wide yorker outside off, well bowled. Jammed out towards cover."
1.2,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","change in length this time, short around off, helped along down to fine leg for one"
1.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, SIX runs","into the second tier! 127 kph, it's a full delivery outside off. Rahul doesn't even extend his lofted drive, he just times a checked cover drive. The ball flies over the cover boundary"
0.6,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run","drifts on the pads, worked away down to fine leg for a run. Cramping Rahul for room"
0.5,"McClenaghan to Rahul, SIX runs","there's six. The first of the night. 1000 IPL runs. It won't be the last six of the evening either. A full delivery outside off, Rahul just caresses an extra cover drive and it travels well over cover"
0.4,"McClenaghan to Gayle, 1 run","a quick single. A full delivery on off and middle, played away towards midwicket for a quick run. Both batsmen have opened their account."
0.3,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run","full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge down towards gully"
0.2,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run","a pick-up pull! Good length on middle and leg, Rahul reads the length early and swivels into a pull, picks out a square fine leg"
0.1,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","a full delivery on off, 135 kph, defended to mid-on"
17.4,"Bravo to Karthik, FOUR runs","slower ball on off, and Karthik's attempted drive takes the outside edge. But just short of point, and then races away for a boundary! Kolkata Knight Riders win by six wickets!"
17.3,"Bravo to Karthik, FOUR runs","full toss on leg stump, and that's been sent into the square-leg boundary! Uses his wrists to clip it to the boundary. Man there in the deep, but just too much power on show"
17.3,"Bravo to Karthik, 1 wide","full and wide outside leg stump. He can't play the whip off his pads, but the team still collects one"
17.2,"Bravo to Karthik, 2 runs","full on off, and Karthik drives with the bat's open face. Not hit well, but that's what earns them the second run"
17.1,"Bravo to Karthik, FOUR runs","Watto too slow! Low full toss on leg stump, and Karthik manages to flick it to the fine-leg boundary"
16.6,"Ngidi to Karthik, 1 run","full ball, and clipped off his pads to fine leg. KKR dealing in singles now"
16.5,"Ngidi to Gill, 1 run","slows things down. Good length on off, and fended with soft hands towards the off side"
16.5,"Ngidi to Gill, 1 wide","back of a length on middle and leg, and once again down the leg side with Gill attempting no shot. He doesn't have to"
16.4,"Ngidi to Karthik, 1 run","outside off, and DK comfortably runs it down to third man"

16.2,"Ngidi to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and that's been played with soft hands. Keeps the ball along the ground, and also allows them to steal a single"
16.1,"Ngidi to Karthik, FOUR runs","short on middle stump, and just the perfect area for Karthik to make merry. Turns and pulls it fine down the ground to the leg-side. Awry from Ngidi"
15.6,"Jadeja to Karthik, 1 run",good length on leg stump. Flicked off his pads to deep midwicket. Time out
15.5,"Jadeja to Karthik, FOUR runs","full just outside off, and he tries to reverse sweep. Not the best connection, but enough to beat short third man!"
15.4,"Jadeja to Karthik, 2 runs","played off his pads to fine leg. Man in the deep has to race across the boundary, and his diving effort saves a few runs"
15.3,"Jadeja to Gill, 1 run","good length on middle, but going straight through. Kinda squares Gill up, but he manages to fend it towards the off side"
15.2,"Jadeja to Gill, FOUR runs","full just outside off, this time the drive is well placed! Between long off and deep extra cover this time"
15.1,"Jadeja to Gill, 2 runs","full just outside off, and that's been driven with soft hands to the extra cover boundary. Enough time to take two runs and that's Gill's fifty!"

14.4,"Asif to Gill, SIX runs","short outside off, and Gill frees his arms again! Cuts it over point, and while it's a dangerous shot, the ball goes over to the deep point boundary. Rayudu in the deep tried to take it one-handed, but it was always going to be advantage Gill"
14.3,"Asif to Gill, 2 runs","good length outside off, and Gill backs away to slap it towards the point boundary. Man in the deep cuts it off"
14.2,"Asif to Gill, no run","full outside off, and Gill cuts it hard. Straight to point however"

12.6,"Bravo to Gill, 1 run","good length on off, but it's the offcutter. The batsman has to adjust before muscling it towards the off side"

12.5,"Bravo to Karthik, 1 wide","short on middle, and he goes for the pull. Misses and through to Dhoni, but the umpire thinks it's wide"
12.4,"Bravo to Gill, 1 run","almost a yorker on off stump, but he does well to get bat to ball. In fact, Gill does much better. Drills it down the ground to long off"
12.3,"Bravo to Gill, FOUR runs","full outside off, and Gill manages to get underneath this! Lifted over extra cover off the bat's sweet spot. The oomph!"
12.2,"Bravo to Gill, no run","full on leg stump, and tapped towards midwicket. Early call for no run"
12.1,"Bravo to Gill, no run","full just outside off, and starts off with the cutter. Gill mistimes his drive, but far enough that Bravo can't reach it. DJ takes a tumble on his followthrough though"

11.5,"Harbhajan to Karthik, no run","good length on off, and DK's happy to defend"
11.4,"Harbhajan to Singh, OUT","The turbanator strikes! Full on middle stump, and his attempted inside out cover drive doesn't come off! Tried to play for the spin, but this one was the one that goes straight through. Crashes into middle stump"

11.2,"Harbhajan to Gill, no run",fast ball! Good length on off and zipping into Gill's pads. Does well to fend it towards the off side
11.1,"Harbhajan to Gill, no run","outside off, but spinning into his pads. Misses the leg-side whip and hits his pads. Umpire not interested in the lbw appeal"
10.6,"Jadeja to Singh, no run","good length on middle stump, and cramps Rinku. All he can do is uncomfortably tap it towards mid off"
10.5,"Jadeja to Gill, 1 run","full just outside off, and driven off the front foot to the cover region"
10.4,"Jadeja to Gill, 2 runs","good length on leg stump, and easily turned off his hips to deep backward square. Played softly, which actually allows them to take the second"
10.3,"Jadeja to Singh, 1 run","good length on middle, and worked off his pads to deep backward square. Gill wants the second, but Rinku sends him back"
10.3,"Jadeja to Singh, 1 wide","drilled full outside leg stump, but Rinku can't paddle it away. Dhoni gets his pads in the way"

9.1,"Harbhajan to Singh, FOUR runs","full outside off, but that's been delicately played! Stays on the back foot and brings out the late cut this time. Risky shot, given the slip in place, but he ensured he chopped the shot into the ground"

8.4,"Jadeja to Singh, no run",good length just outside off but going across the batsman. Misses the cut
8.4,"Jadeja to Singh, 5 wide","Rare! Dhoni misses behind the stumps. Full outside leg stump, but turning further away from the left-hander. He can't play the sweep, and neither can the keeper hold on"
8.3,"Jadeja to Singh, no run","good length on off stump, and he goes onto the back foot to cut. Misses, but the ball hits Dhoni's pads and hits the stumps. Looked like Singh was in the crease, but was his back leg up? Third umpire. Nope, he's good."

8.1,"Jadeja to Singh, 1 run","good length on middle, but he backs away to cut it to the man in the deep. Enough time to walk across for the single"

7.2,"Harbhajan to Singh, no run",full just outside off. Rinku goes onto the front foot but defends this time
7.1,"Harbhajan to Singh, FOUR runs","meets Bhajji with a four! Good length outside off, and Rinku drives it past cover! Beautiful use of the feet on this occasion"

6.5,"Jadeja to Singh, 2 runs","good length on off, but spinning into Rinku. He makes room, and cuts it past point to the man in the deep. Good footwork to make that extra room"
6.4,"Jadeja to Narine, OUT","tries to cramp him for room, and earns the wicket! Back of a length outside off, but gets big on Narine. He still tries to muscle it to long on, but off the bat's inside half. Doesn't have the distance and comfortably taken by the man in the deep. Jadeja finally manages to remove Narine"

4.4,"Asif to Narine, no run","slower ball, full outside off. Goes for a wild heave over cover but deceived by the pace. Through to Dhoni on the bounce"
4.3,"Asif to Narine, FOUR runs","full outside off, and Narine's attempted drive takes that familiar outside edge again. Third man tries to cut it off, but his sliding effort ain't good enough!"
4.2,"Asif to Uthappa, OUT","back of a length outside off, and the attempted pull has been top edged! Midwicket goes under it, and finally CSK hold on to a catch. Just that extra bit of pace that does Uthappa in"

2.6,"Ngidi to Uthappa, FOUR runs","full on middle stump, and Uthappa takes his front leg across and simply flicks it off his pads to deep midwicket. Harbhajan's in the deep, but his attempted chase is futile. What sweet sound off the bat"

2.1,"Ngidi to Uthappa, 1 run","good length just outside off, and Uthappa defends with soft hands towards third man"
1.6,"Asif to Narine, no run","dropped by Jadeja again! Narine is a cat! How many lives?! Back of a length on middle, and this inside out slap comes off the bat's top half again. But Jadeja can't hold on to it after bending backwards to reach at this high ball. Hits his palm and pops out"
1.5,"Asif to Narine, no run","good length on off stump, and that's been flat-batted inside out. Straight to Jadeja at wide mid off, but it's been dropped! Soft, very soft. Wonder if he took it too casually"
1.4,"Asif to Narine, SIX runs","over long on! Finally connects, and of course it goes beyond the boundary. Same length, and this time Narine manages to tee off"

0.6,"Ngidi to Lynn, OUT","full on middle stump, and angling into Lynn. He tries to go for a leg-side heave, but the ball hits his front thigh and goes through to first slip! Goes to Watson at first slip, and they're appealing for caught behind! Brief chat between Watto and MSD, and they're reviewing. Replays show, it took an under edge before hitting his though. Lynn has to go"

19.6,"Chawla to Dhoni, FOUR runs","Dhoni closes out CSK's innings with a boundary. Back of a length on middle, 123ks, as quick as Vinay Kumar, Dhoni loads up and smokes it away to the midwicket boundary. If you're still wondering, Thala still has it"
19.5,"Chawla to Jadeja, OUT","banged in short and fizzes away outside off, seam-up ball I guess, Jadeja swings across the line and top-edges it in the air. DK settles under the skier with the big gloves"
19.4,"Chawla to Jadeja, 4 byes","Jadeja misses, DK misses, the result is four byes. Full and breaks away outside off, googly, Jadeja loses his shape on the slog-sweep, the ball sneaks through the keeper's legs"

2.3,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, 1 run","Mavi ventures wide of the crease, brings the ball back into Watson with that sharp angle. The Australian nearly plays on. Inside-edges it and hares across to the other end. Mavi swoops down on the ball and nails an under-arm throw. But Faf makes his crease with a full-stretch drive"

10.3,"Plunkett to Tripathi, no run","appeal for lbw, and a chance for a run out as well! But not given lbw, so Plunkett reviews. It was full on off stump, and he tried to slog sweep towards the leg side. It had hit his front leg but would've gone down leg stump. The review's been lost."
10.2,"Plunkett to Tripathi, FOUR runs","back of a length on middle, and he's quick to swivel and pull! One-bounce four to the fine-leg boundary. Used his wrists to play it as fine as possible"

8.1,"Boult to Samson, OUT","Munro at cow corner! And that's the Purple cap for Boult. Full on off stump, and Samson's leg-side whip is mistimed. In the air for ages as Munro comes running in. Takes a sharp catch with the floodlights disturbing his vision for certain"

3.4,"Plunkett to Buttler, FOUR runs","tough chance, but dropped by Pant! Good length outside leg stump because Buttler was shuffling across to the off side. Misses the pull, and the ball hits his gloves as it goes down the leg side. But just too wide of the keeper"

3.1,"Plunkett to Buttler, SIX runs","full outside off, and just the right length for Buttler to get under it. Picks the offcutter early, and thumps this inside out over cover"

0.2,"Nadeem to Buttler, 1 leg bye","good length on off, and he misses the leg-side whip. Hits his pad but the lbw appeal is turned down"
0.1,"Nadeem to Short, 1 run","good length just outside off, and spinning into Short. Flicked off his pads to midwicket for a quick single"
17.1,"Archer to Maxwell, OUT","17.01 Yorker on middle stump, and Maxwell can't get his boot out of the way. Crashes into his toes in front of leg stump and the umpire has no hesitation. Maxwell's reviews, but starts walking to the boundary. Does he think it's out? Nope, it's raining. The players walk off as the third umpire adjudicates. He's out!"
16.6,"Unadkat to Maxwell, 1 run","full toss wide outside off, and Maxwell slaps this towards the off side. An excellent diving stop at point keeps it down to one"
16.5,"Unadkat to Plunkett, 1 run","slower ball, and full outside off. Plunkett shuffles across to the off side and clips it to Stokes at deep midwicket"
16.4,"Unadkat to Plunkett, no run","good length outside off, but stays a bit low. Tried to play the late cut, but missed it"
16.3,"Unadkat to Maxwell, 3 runs","full outside off, but wide enough to muscle it over cover. Not hit well but played in the gap. Short and Tripathi combine near wide long off to intercept"
16.2,"Unadkat to Shankar, OUT","Tripathi under it! Full just outside off, and Shankar goes for another biggie. This time it's off the toe end of the bat and long off was manning the boundary. Seventeen off six in a innings run-rate of 11.69. An excellent cameo"
16.1,"Unadkat to Shankar, FOUR runs","full on middle stump, and Shankar makes full use of the angle! Uses his wrists to whip it over fine leg"
15.6,"Archer to Maxwell, no run","yorker! On leg stump, and Maxwell does well to get his toes out of the way and block it"
15.5,"Archer to Shankar, 1 run","full just outside off, and that's been lifted over the bowler's head. Man at long on though"
15.5,"Archer to Shankar, 1 wide","short on leg stump, and too high. Shankar doesn't even duck and that's flown over his helmet"
15.4,"Archer to Shankar, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, but Shankar tries to carve this over point. Slices it over slip instead, and that's another boundary"
15.3,"Archer to Shankar, SIX runs","Shanked! Back of a length on middle stump, and he backs away to flat-bat it over deep midwicket. Wonderful use of the crease's depth to earn that extra second"
15.2,"Archer to Shankar, 2 runs","full on middle stump, and Shankar shuffles to the off side to flick towards cow corner. Maxwell wants two, and that's a well-timed run"
15.1,"Archer to Maxwell, 1 run","good length on off stump, and Maxwell taps it towards long on off the back foot"
14.6,"Unadkat to Pant, OUT","overpitched outside off, but the slower one does him in. Tried to slog it towards deep midwicket again, but this time it's a one-handed shot. Doesn't have the distance, and Stokes - at long on - settles under it"
14.5,"Unadkat to Pant, no run","full and wide outside off, big stride forward but the drive's been mistimed"
14.4,"Unadkat to Pant, SIX runs","we often see a wicket fall after the time-out, but rarely a six! Offcutter outside off stump, but too wide. Pant winds up, and thumps it over cow corner"
14.3,"Unadkat to Iyer, OUT","Iyer holes out! A slower delivery outside off, Iyer backs away and chips an uppish drive to long-off. He wanted to hit that straighter, but the cut on the offcutter took that away from the bat, which meant he could only slice the ball. Tripathi just about holds on."
14.2,"Unadkat to Pant, 5 runs","a slower offcutter around leg, Pant goes through the shot, but it takes the glove towards Buttler. He throws directly at the bowler's end, the ball ricochets away. Stokes runs around and lets the ball go through his legs. That's very sloppy"
14.1,"Unadkat to Iyer, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, chopped to third man. That's Iyer's fourth fifty in five matches"
13.6,"Stokes to Pant, SIX runs","a slower ball and six more. It's slightly wide outside off, Pant stays in his crease and crashes an uppish drive over cover. Sensational timing from Pant."
13.5,"Stokes to Pant, 2 runs","full and straight, a bottom-handed whip through long-on for two. Archer runs around to his right and parries the ball to long-off, with a dive."
13.4,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","a low full toss around off, worked down to fine leg for one."
13.3,"Stokes to Pant, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, slogged away to long-on. That's also Pant's fifty, off just 23 balls"
13.2,"Stokes to Pant, FOUR runs","absolutely pummeled through cover! Full and wide outside off, Pant smashes that past the fielder at cover again. Great timing too"
13.1,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","a slower delivery, 117 kph, worked away to deep square leg for one"
12.6,"Kulkarni to Pant, FOUR runs","140 kph, it's full and wide. Pant absolutely hammers his drive to cover. The ball goes right through the fielder's legs for four. 20 runs off that over, better overs will go for more."
12.5,"Kulkarni to Pant, FOUR runs",and now he bowls a low full toss that is wide. Pant drills the drive through cover. Smashed past the fielder.
12.5,"Kulkarni to Pant, 1 wide",he tries it again and concedes another wide. The wide yorker is well away from the tramline! Aargh.
12.5,"Kulkarni to Pant, 1 wide","another wide yorker attempted, another wide."
12.5,"Kulkarni to Pant, 1 wide",tries another wide yorker but goes very wrong. Wide
12.4,"Kulkarni to Pant, no run","a wide yorker outside off, well executed. Just inside the tramline"
12.3,"Kulkarni to Pant, SIX runs","six more. That's some tripe from Dhawal. It's short down leg, all Pant needs is some bat. Even better if he gets a top edge, like this one. Way over fine leg for six."
12.2,"Kulkarni to Iyer, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, carved away towards Gopal at short third man. He gets around to his right and prevents the ball from going through"
12.1,"Kulkarni to Iyer, 2 runs","full on the pads, clipped away to square leg for two. The line is not very good."
11.6,"Gowtham to Pant, no run","flat and straight, around off. Defended"
11.5,"Gowtham to Pant, FOUR runs","that's very well played. Flat on off, Pant switches his stance and paddles the scoop over short fine leg. A reverse-paddle scoop. What else, T20s?"
11.4,"Gowtham to Pant, FOUR runs","it's too short from Gowtham, on middle and leg. Smashed into the gap at square leg for four."
11.3,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run","well bowled, slower and wider outside off. Iyer drags a sweep to deep midwicket for one"
11.2,"Gowtham to Iyer, SIX runs","he's picked that and deposited it into the stands over midwicket! It's full around off, Iyer stays low and T20s that away over midwicket. A heave and a slog."
11.1,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run","flat and straight, worked away into the gap at midwicket. But Stokes races to the ball to prevent two, from long-on"
10.6,"Unadkat to Pant, 1 run","another cutter outside off, 117 kph, hit away to long-on for one"
10.5,"Unadkat to Iyer, 1 run","a slower delivery again outside off, slashed to deep point"
10.4,"Unadkat to Iyer, 2 runs","it's another offcutter, just too predictable. Iyer drills that shot straight, over the umpire's head. Stokes runs around from long-on, running to his left."
10.3,"Unadkat to Pant, 1 run","a slower ball on middle, slogged away towards deep square leg, one more"
10.2,"Unadkat to Pant, FOUR runs","short, 126 kph. Pant hurries to get inside the line and help that along to the fine leg boundary. Just inside the boundary."
10.1,"Unadkat to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length outside off, 134 kph, guided down to third man for one"
9.6,"Archer to Pant, SIX runs","Archer errs, he bowled that full and straight. Pant got ably underneath the length of that and lofted that cleanly over long-on for six. Superb hit."
9.5,"Archer to Pant, no run","a yorker, around off, pushed back to the bowler"
9.4,"Archer to Iyer, 1 run","a low full toss on middle and leg, chipped away to long-on for a run."
9.3,"Archer to Iyer, FOUR runs","goes short, very short outside off. Iyer just slices a cut over backward point. Over the fielder and into the boundary for four."
9.2,"Archer to Iyer, no run","another legcutter, on off. Pushed to cover. Another dot."
9.1,"Archer to Iyer, no run","a slower ball outside off, tapped to point. Played in front of square."
8.6,"Stokes to Pant, FOUR runs","a slower ball, Pant picks the length and swats the ball over midwicket. That's just smashed."
8.6,"Stokes to Pant, 1 wide","another one that strays down leg, wide. Just like Stokes' previous over"
8.5,"Stokes to Pant, no run","another short delivery, back of a length outside off. Pant can't connect with his attempt to pull to square leg"
8.4,"Stokes to Pant, no run","hurried for pace again. A short delivery on the ribs, Pant misses this, and is struck on the midriff. Ouchy!"
8.3,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","a slower ball on middle and leg, slogged away to long-on"
8.2,"Stokes to Pant, 1 leg bye","wanted to help that along, but was beaten for pace. A back of a length delivery that's on the pads, he looks to flick that down to fine leg, but the ball ricochets there off the thigh pad"
8.1,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","full outside off, a thick outside-half dab to third man"
7.6,"Gopal to Pant, SIX runs","that's the fourth six he's gone for. Some more flight outside off, Pant has had enough of plodding about. Swings through the line and lifts the ball comfortably over long-on"
7.5,"Gopal to Pant, no run","81 kph, the googly, pitches outside leg. Pant unwinds and looks for a slog sweep but misses. He's struck on the pad"
7.4,"Gopal to Pant, no run","nicely bowled, some flight and dip, around off, defended back"
7.3,"Gopal to Pant, no run","the googly, on middle and off, blocked back"
7.2,"Gopal to Shaw, OUT","chipped back to the bowler! It's a legbreak, around middle, extracts some turn. Shaw stays in the crease, looks to drive the ball to long-off, but he's not in a great position. Because of the turn, all he can do is hit a leaden-footed poke back to Gopal"
7.1,"Gopal to Shaw, SIX runs","six more. That's the third six he's conceded. Runs down to the pitch of the legbreak, knows it's wide outside off so the off side is a better shot. And drills a lofted drive over cover. Just clears the boundary"
6.6,"Stokes to Shaw, 1 run","a slower ball on middle, worked to deep midwicket. Decent over."
6.6,"Stokes to Shaw, 1 wide","strays down leg, wide"
6.5,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","a good length delivery is tapped towards point. Iyer sends Shaw back. The throw from point to the non-striker's end is accurate, but the ricochet allows one overthrow."
6.4,"Stokes to Shaw, 1 run","full on middle and leg, pushed to long-on for one. Biding their time"
6.3,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","full outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover for one"
6.2,"Stokes to Shaw, 1 run","that's a poor ball, very lucky he's got away with that. Looked like a short legcutter, but on the hips. Shaw swivels on a shot and picks out deep square leg"
6.1,"Stokes to Shaw, no run","goes short, a bouncer on middle and leg, Shaw gets underneath that."
5.6,"Gopal to Iyer, SIX runs","six more, into the stands! This one is dropped short, around off. Iyer rocks back and swats a pull over deep midwicket. Great hit again. Playing the spinner's probabilities"
5.5,"Gopal to Iyer, SIX runs","the quicker one, Iyer knew what was coming. All he does is chip a lofted flick over long-on. Full and very quick, smashed!"
5.4,"Gopal to Iyer, no run","it's very full again, around off. Iyer clears his front leg and powers a drive to cover, all along the ground."
5.3,"Gopal to Iyer, no run","90 kph, flat on middle and off. Iyer comes down and misses a flick, struck on the thigh pad"
5.2,"Gopal to Shaw, 1 run","a googly, outside off, swept to deep square leg. Too full"
5.1,"Gopal to Iyer, 1 run","the googly outside off, just outside off, chopped away to point."
4.6,"Unadkat to Shaw, SIX runs","goes through with the shot again! Three offcutters from Unadkat and they've all been smashed! Shaw goes through with another lofted drive, this time he gets plenty of timing and power behind the stroke. Clears mid-off easily."
4.5,"Unadkat to Shaw, FOUR runs","four more! Good comeback this from Delhi. Another cutter, Shaw just times his bunt this time. Much more in control, decent-enough timing for the short boundaries and four through mid-off"
4.4,"Unadkat to Shaw, FOUR runs","has he got enough? Just about to clear mid-on. Back of a length offcutter. Shaw picks the length but not the variation, which is why the timing is bad. Still, he gets enough to chip the ball over mid-on and into the boundary"
4.3,"Unadkat to Iyer, 1 run","finds the gap this time. Full and wide, Iyer gets forward and slices a drive to deep point"
4.2,"Unadkat to Iyer, no run","a cutter, an offcutter outside off. Nicely timed away to the same fielder."
4.1,"Unadkat to Iyer, no run","full outside off, Iyer still manages to angle his bat face and guides the ball to cover point"
3.6,"Gowtham to Shaw, no run","finds the fielder this time. Short and wide outside off, a cut finds point"
3.5,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run","full around off, pushed to long-on"
3.4,"Gowtham to Iyer, FOUR runs","carved away through backward point. Full and flat, and quick outside off. Iyer stays inside the line and scythes the ball in the air and in the gap"
3.3,"Gowtham to Shaw, 1 run","flat and straight, the ball spins back in, worked away to deep midwicket"
3.2,"Gowtham to Shaw, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Flat outside off, Shaw backs away and punches a drive quite comfortably through cover"
3.1,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run","flat outside off, nudged away towards midwicket"
2.6,"Kulkarni to Shaw, no run","dropped! Almost stuck. 135 kph, low full toss is belted back at Dhawal. Fight or flight kicks in because it's aimed at his head. He gets his hands up and catches the ball, but it pops out slyly and lies on the ground, grinning back at Dhawal."
2.5,"Kulkarni to Shaw, FOUR runs","swatted away into the gap at extra cover. It's another short, slower delivery. Shaw picks the variation early enough and thrashes the ball into the gap at cover"
2.4,"Kulkarni to Shaw, no run","a good yorker on middle and leg, jammed back towards mid-off"
2.3,"Kulkarni to Shaw, SIX runs","goes again, six more. He's just picking length very quickly. Once he does that, it's all a bit too easy for class batsmen, like de Villiers. Shaw shows some of his skill with a bottom-handed loft over mid-on."
2.2,"Kulkarni to Shaw, no run","shorter, back of a length outside off. Shaw gets over the bounce, watches the ball down and guides to short third man"
2.1,"Kulkarni to Shaw, SIX runs","a pick-flick for six. Back of a length, down leg, Shaw gets underneath the length and chips the ball elegantly over midwicket for six. Massive hit."
1.6,"Archer to Iyer, no run","the second bouncer? No, says the square leg umpire. How do bowlers keep getting away with this? Dug in very short, Iyer ducks and looks at the umpire immediately."
1.5,"Archer to Iyer, no run","back of a length around off, defended away to mid-off"
1.4,"Archer to Iyer, FOUR runs","too straight again and picked away. Not been a great over, 135 kph, on the pads. Iyer just gets a bit of bat on that and tickles the ball fine, to the fine leg boundary."
1.3,"Archer to Shaw, 1 run","back of a length, down leg though. Nudged down to fine leg for one."
1.2,"Archer to Shaw, no run","dug in short again, Shaw gets underneath. The one for the over, well used again"
1.1,"Archer to Shaw, no run","short and wide from Archer, not the best start. Slashed away to backward point."
0.6,"Kulkarni to Iyer, no run","a short delivery outside off, a very clever change in length to earn himself a dot ball. Banged in and Iyer ducks. One over, one for one."
0.5,"Kulkarni to Iyer, no run",a good length delivery on middle to start to Iyer. Pushed to mid-on
0.4,"Kulkarni to Munro, OUT","edged and gone! An inside edge is taken by Buttler. A golden duck for Munro. It's nice and full again, inviting a drive. The ball moves back in, in the air. Munro goes driving, but he's played slightly outside the line. A thick inside edge is found, Buttler dives to his right and takes an easy catch. Excellent bowling to persist with that full length in swinging conditions."
0.3,"Kulkarni to Shaw, 1 run","Delhi's first runs. On middle and leg, flicked away easily through deep square leg for a single."
0.2,"Kulkarni to Shaw, no run","a bit of width! Full and wide, the ball moving further away. Shaw mis-times a drive towards extra cover."
0.1,"Kulkarni to Shaw, no run","a nice and full start. Full and moving away, on middle and off, punched away to mid-off from the crease"
19.6,"Southee to Cutting, SIX runs","ends with a sixer! But it doesn't matter for RCB. Full outside off, and Cutting slogs this over long off to finish the game on a semi-high. Royal Challengers Bangalore win by 14 runs!"
19.5,"Southee to Cutting, no run",excellent yorker! Ricochets it onto his toes while trying to squeeze this out
19.4,"Southee to Cutting, no run","back of a length outside off, but Southee takes the pace off it. Pulled to cow corner, but these are consolation runs"
19.3,"Southee to Cutting, no run","full outside off, and the expansive drive takes the inside edge. Goes to square leg"
19.2,"Southee to Cutting, FOUR runs","full outside off, and Cutting drags the slog towards the leg side. Deceived by the slower ball, but enough power behind that shot to beat deep midwicket"
19.1,"Southee to Pandya, OUT","Is that the game?! Full on off, and Hardik drills it straight to long on. Dives forward and takes an excellent tumbling catch. What a change in attitude though. Kohli took a similar catch two nights ago, but didn't show any emotion that evening. Today he's ecstatic"
18.6,"Siraj to Cutting, 2 runs","knee-high full toss outside off, and Cutting muscles a pull to cow corner. De Grandhomme saves some more runs in the deep with a sliding effort"
18.5,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 run","full outside off, and all Hardik can do is muscle a drive to wide long off. His 2nd IPL fifty"
18.4,"Siraj to Pandya, no run","full and wide outside off, and Hardik can't connect with the drive. Through to QDK on the full. Excellent ball given the game situation"
18.3,"Siraj to Krunal, OUT","that defied the laws of Physics! Full on leg stump, and Krunal got down on one knee to ramp it over fine leg. Takes the leading edge, and goes to wait for it point."
18.2,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 run","yorker just outside off, and Hardik does well to squeeze it past Krunal. But where's his bat?! It flew off his gloves and landed near the keeper. Sweaty evening"
18.1,"Siraj to Krunal, 1 run","full toss on leg stump, and Krunal can't put it away. Hits his front leg as they scamper across for the run. Another run added to the extras. They're reviewing . Where's the impact?! Oh wow, it's an inside edge. Excellent from umpire Erasmus, who had given it a run in the first place anyway"
17.6,"Southee to Krunal, 1 run","slower ball outside off, and Krunal lifts this inside out over cover. Deep extra cover does well to race across and intercept"
17.5,"Southee to Krunal, no run","experience showing here! Yorker on middle stump, and all Krunal can do is dig it back to the bowler"
17.4,"Southee to Pandya, 1 run","yorker on middle stump, and Hardik does well to squeeze it down the ground. Kohli at long on"
17.3,"Southee to Krunal, 1 run","slower ball, on a good length on off stump. Mistimes his pull down the ground to long on"
17.2,"Southee to Pandya, 1 run","de Grandhomme saves a certain four! Great sliding effort at long off. The full ball was crunched past Southee, but his fellow New Zealander saves RCB three"
17.1,"Southee to Krunal, 1 run","slower ball, on off stump. It's angling across his body, but Krunal's leg-side heave is mistimed. Goes to long off instead"
16.6,"Siraj to Pandya, FOUR runs","sliced inside out! Full outside off, and that's been muscled over the infield. Too much for wide long off to do"
16.5,"Siraj to Krunal, 1 run","full toss on middle stump, and Krunal's leg-side push doesn't come off. Appeal for lbw by Siraj, but Erasmus thinks that was bat first. Yep, he's spot on"
16.4,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 run","almost a yorker outside off, and Hardik does well to dig it out. The ball's going towards Krunal, and Siraj can't field it despite the effort"
16.3,"Siraj to Krunal, 1 run","offcutter on leg stump, and Krunal comfortably flicks it to short fine leg. Calls early for the single"
16.2,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 run","full outside off, and driven down the ground to long on. It's mistimed from Hardik"
16.2,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 wide","Siraj and wides. What a love story. Good length, but way outside off. Goes to QDK on the bounce"
16.1,"Siraj to Krunal, 1 run","good length on off stump, and Krunal's leg-side pull takes a leading edge towards long off!"
15.6,"Grandhomme to Pandya, FOUR runs","good length on middle stump, and Hardik flicks it fine with the ball going down the leg side. Short fine leg is too square!"
15.5,"Grandhomme to Pandya, 2 runs","good length outside off, and Hardik smothers it to cow corner. Calls nice and early for the second run"
15.4,"Grandhomme to Pandya, FOUR runs","Lucky! Hardik'll take it. Good length on off, and his punch towards mid off takes the bat's inside edge. Short fine leg has no chance"
15.3,"Grandhomme to Krunal, 1 run","slower ball, but overpitched on off. Drills it to cover and gives Hardik the strike"
15.2,"Grandhomme to Krunal, no run","tries to be too cute! Good length on off, and the attempted late cut doesn't come off. Well taken by QDK"
15.1,"Grandhomme to Krunal, SIX runs","into the second tier! Full on leg stump, and Krunal takes a big step forward and muscles it over deep midwicket. It was the offcutter, and the batsman pounced onto that in a flash!"
14.6,"Yadav to Krunal, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and Krunal backs away towards the leg side. Tries to fend it but takes the inside edge towards deep midwicket"
14.5,"Yadav to Krunal, 2 runs","full outside off, and that's been lifted over cover! In the air for a while, and drops between the three people in the deep. The ball changes direction after pitching, so Vohra's on all fours trying to stop the ball. Comedy of errors. Kohli won't find it funny though"
14.4,"Yadav to Pandya, 1 run","good length outside off, but it's the offcutter. Cramped for room, and manages to only muscle it towards cover. The mistimed shot actually allows them to take the single with ease"
14.3,"Yadav to Pandya, no run","misses the cut! Was wide outside off, and Hardik will be disappointed on missing out. Could've placed that anywhere behind square on the off side"
14.2,"Yadav to Krunal, 1 run",back of a length on middle stump. Krunal stays on the back foot and punches it past the bowler's left. Man at long on though
14.1,"Yadav to Pandya, 1 run","full on middle stump, and that's been clipped off his toes to deep backward square. Only a single"
13.6,"Grandhomme to Pandya, 1 run","good length outside off, and wide enough to cut it off the front foot. Man at deep extra cover though. Time out"
13.5,"Grandhomme to Krunal, 1 bye","offcutter on leg stump, and Krunal's deceived for the pace. Tried to pull but through his shot too early. De Kock can't grab onto it either, so Krunal manages to steal a run"
13.4,"Grandhomme to Krunal, no run","full outside off stump, and that's been driven away from his body. Excellent work from Mccullum at cover"
13.3,"Grandhomme to Pandya, 1 run","good length on middle, and that's been mistimed to square leg"
13.2,"Grandhomme to Pandya, no run","good length on middle, and Pandya misses on drive. Inside edge onto his pads, and that's why the umpire says no to the lbw appeal"
13.2,"Grandhomme to Pandya, 5 wide","more extras! Good length on middle stump but swings down the leg side. QDK can't hold on to it, and that goes to the fine-leg boundary"
13.1,"Grandhomme to Pandya, no run","short on off, but that's taken Hardik by surprise. Tried to pull, but it hits him hard on his right shoulder. That's gonna hurt. The physio's out and his brother comes to check on him as well"
12.6,"Chahal to Krunal, FOUR runs","good length on leg, and Krunal shuffles across to the off side and paddles this fine. Virat was lurking at leg slip but just past his outstretched right hand. He's not happy"
12.5,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 leg bye","big appeal! But not given. Full on off, but Hardik misses the sweep. Would've missed off stump, reckons umpire Erasmus"
12.4,"Chahal to Pandya, no run","beaut! Good length on middle, and spins across the batsman's body. Tried to defend off the front foot, but he's no where near the ball"
12.4,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 wide","full outside off, and Hardik judges this well. Spinning away from him, and too wide reckons the umpire. Shoulders his arms to the spiner"
12.3,"Chahal to Krunal, 1 run","good length on off, and turning into Krunal's pads. Nudged off his pads to square leg"
12.2,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 run","good length on off, and wild spin once again off the surface. Cuts this legspinner to deep extra cover. Gives his brother the strike"
12.1,"Chahal to Pandya, no run","good length on middle, and it's the wrong'un! Comes sharply into his body and Hardik uncomfortably defends off the back foot"
11.6,"Grandhomme to Duminy, 1 run, OUT","offcutter on middle stump. It's angling across his body, and Duminy cuts to deep point. He wants the second run, but that could be dangerous! QDK quickly takes the bails off, and we need the third umpire. He's gone! Bat on the line, but you know what they say, that crease belongs to the umpire. (adds a dollar to the cliche jar)"
11.5,"Grandhomme to Duminy, no run","full on off, and that's been driven off the front foot. Straight to CDG though"
11.4,"Grandhomme to Pandya, 1 run","good length outside off, and angling into Hardik. That allows him to pull to deep midwicket"
11.3,"Grandhomme to Pandya, no run","back of a length on off, and too close to Hardik for the cut. Played straight to Kohli at cover point"
11.2,"Grandhomme to Duminy, 1 run","full on off, and delivers the cutter this time. Duminy does well to judge the pace and pushes it past Hardik to long off"
11.1,"Grandhomme to Pandya, 1 run","good length on off, and driven past the non-striker to long on for a walking single"
10.6,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 run","good length on off, and cut off the back foot with the ball turning away from him. He'll keep strike"
10.5,"Chahal to Pandya, no run",peach! Full on off and Pandya tries to defend off the front foot. But the ball grips the pitch and spins across his blade. Could've easily taken the outside edge
10.4,"Chahal to Duminy, 1 run","full outside off, and Duminy sweeps it to the man in the deep. Hands the strike back to Hardik"

8.3,"Chahal to Pandya, FOUR runs","drilled by Pandya. Full on off, and he gets his front foot out of the way before tonking this past Chahal. The bowler does well not to get his hands to it"
8.2,"Chahal to Pandya, no run","good length on off, and once again spinning wildly after hitting the surface. Hardik's in no place to punch it towards cover"

7.1,"Siraj to Pollard, OUT","soft dismissal! Edged to QDK. Good length outside off, and Pollard tries to play the late cut. The ball just about seams away after pitching and that induces the edge. Comfortably taken by the keeper and Siraj is ecstatic!"

5.6,"Yadav to Pollard, 5 runs","overpitched outside off, and that's been drilled to McCullum at mid off. Could be a run out, but it's not a direct hit! Oh dear, no one's backing up either. Chahal and Siraj try hard to stop the ball near the boundary, but it's a futile attempt by both men. Free runs for Mumbai to end the Powerplay"
5.5,"Yadav to Pollard, no run","back of a length outside off, and seaming slightly away after pitching. Pollard tries to pull again, but that shot's been eluding him all evening. Goes over his bat and through to QDK"

3.6,"Yadav to Pollard, 1 wide","goes short again to finish the over, but wait, he's got to bowl that again. Too short on off stump, and it's too high even for the tall West Indian"
3.5,"Yadav to Duminy, 1 leg bye","good length on off, and angling sharply into his body. Tries to flick it towards short fine leg, but can't get bat on ball. Hits his thigh pad instead"

3.3,"Yadav to Pollard, no run","hits him just under his throat! Pollard doesn't react. Short on off, and Pollard takes a step forward before choosing not to duck. The ball's well directed and I can't believe Pollard shows no emotion"
3.2,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, OUT","back of a length on off and that's nipped in sharply! Cuts the batsman in half, and the ball goes between bat and elbow. QDK dives to his left and takes a one hander and appeals for caught behind. The umpire says not out. QDK wants to review and yes! That's come off the inside shoulder of the bat. Big deflection"
3.1,"Yadav to Yadav, OUT","given lbw! Suryakumar's reviewing. Full just outside off, and he tries to paddle it towards the leg side. But he got his front leg across the stumps, and that's plumb if you miss the shot. The ball stayed slightly low, and replays say 'umpire's call'"

0.6,"Southee to Ishan, OUT","another duck for Kishan! Third duck in four innings. Full on off stump, and swings into Kishan's pads. He tries to drive towards mid on, but there's a big gap between bat and pad. The ball sneaks through and crashes into off middle stump. Perfect start for Bangalore"
0.5,"Southee to Yadav, 1 run","dropped at first slip! Tough chance. Good length on off, and that's squared the batsman. Tried to defend towards the leg side but takes the leading edge to slip. Vohra the guilty man"
0.4,"Southee to Yadav, no run","lovely! On a good length outside off, and just about shaping away from Yadav. He tried to defend off the back foot but didn't account for the swing. Just past his outside edge"
0.3,"Southee to Yadav, FOUR runs","too wide, and Suryakumar's seen enough! Big stride towards the off side, and thumps this drive between cover and extra cover. Glorious"
0.2,"Southee to Yadav, no run","full outside off again, and driven by Suryakumar off the front foot. The ball was swinging away, and the batsman did well to reach at it. Finds Kohli at cover though"
0.1,"Southee to Yadav, no run","full outside off, and shaping away from the batsman. Tries an expansive drive, but struck straight to point"

3.2,"Duminy to Vohra, SIX runs","fuller and just a shade outside off, Vohra aims for another loft again, this time he slices it over mid-off. This goes all the way"
3.1,"Duminy to Vohra, FOUR runs","tossed on off stump, Vohra ventures down the track, manufactures a half-volley and lofts it straight of mid-on. Lovely swing of the arms"
2.6,"Bumrah to de Kock, no run","slower ball, back of a length, climbs over middle stump as De Kock swings early and misses again"
2.5,"Bumrah to de Kock, no run","De Kock clears his front leg, backs away outside leg, this is fuller and nipping away outside off. De Kock throws his bat at the ball but does not make contact"
2.4,"Bumrah to Vohra, 1 run","keeps it on a back of a length, the line is outside off, Vohra rides it down to deep third man"
2.3,"Bumrah to de Kock, 1 run","back of a length and angling away just a shade outside off, possibly a slower ball, de Kock waits on it before dabbing it to the leg side with soft hands"

1.6,"McClenaghan to de Kock, no run",McClenaghan hits a hard length on off - neither driveable nor pullable - patted to the off side
1.5,"McClenaghan to de Kock, no run","full nip-backer from McClenaghan, de Kock is late onto it as the ball skids off the pitch. He squirts an inside edge onto the pad and weathers an lbw appeal"

1.3,"McClenaghan to Vohra, no run","back of a length, slower offcutter, sticks in the pitch, bounces, Vohra closes the face early and pops a leading edge to cover"
1.2,"McClenaghan to Vohra, no run","back of a length and angling across off stump, Vohra has a mighty whoosh at it  and only collects fresh air. He attempts a leg-side slog and loses his shape"

19.6,"Ngidi to Shankar, 1 run","almost in the blockhole again, this one's angled into the pads, and it's squeezed out through midwicket"
19.5,"Ngidi to Tewatia, 1 run","wide yorker, very good from Ngidi, squeezed out to cover"
19.4,"Ngidi to Shankar, 1 run",backs away again but this time it's a fuller ball and his attempt to drill it through the off side results in an inside edge to short midwicket. Game over if the next two balls are legal
19.3,"Ngidi to Shankar, 2 runs",backs away again to a short of a length delivery and just chips it over the in-field to scamper back for two
19.3,"Ngidi to Shankar, 1 wide","length ball, angled down the leg side as the batsman backs away. Pressure getting on to Ngidi"
19.2,"Ngidi to Shankar, SIX runs","is that a six? Yes, it is. Shankar with some timely blows here but have they come too late? Short of a length, he backs away to give himself room and heaves it over cow corner. DD need at least three more of these"

18.4,"Bravo to Shankar, SIX runs",now he switches over to a short length and Shankar crunches a pull over deep midwicket. Bravo getting his lengths all wrong at the death  but CSK still well ahead

16.4,"Bravo to Pant, no run","extremely full outside off, Pant drills it out to mid-off"

16.1,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 run",Shankar slaps at the sight of width but it only goes so far as sweeper cover on the bounce
15.6,"Asif to Pant, SIX runs","can't bowl there at this stage of the innings. A fuller ball on the pads, and Pant whips it off them over deep midwicket"
15.5,"Asif to Pant, FOUR runs","oh, shot. Falls over as he shuffles across and paddles it away. Off the inside part of the bat, and that actually works to his favour as he gets it finer of short fine leg"
15.4,"Asif to Pant, 2 runs","full and angled across, hammered away wide of long-off"
15.3,"Asif to Pant, FOUR runs",sloppy effort from Rayudu gives Pant his fifty. Launches this fuller one without much timing straight over. Rayudu runs across from long-off and slides across and sticks one hand out and lets it go through

14.1,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","yorker outside off, clipped off the pads through the gap between midwicket and mid-on"
13.6,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run","length, flicked from outside off to midwicket"
13.5,"Harbhajan to Shankar, 1 run",in the air and just short. Miscues a pull off the bottom part of the bat and it lobs in the air. Karn Sharma at short third man sprints forward but it drops just short of him
13.4,"Harbhajan to Shankar, FOUR runs",sprays it on a leg-stump line and Shankar whips it off the inner part of the bat past Dhoni to fine leg
13.3,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run",unleashes a late cut at this short and wide delivery and Raina at point half-stops it with a big dive to his left

7.1,"Harbhajan to Pant, no run","tossed up outside off, Pant reaches out for a drive and inside-edges it back onto the pads"
6.6,"Jadeja to Iyer, OUT","Awful mix-up between the wickets, and Iyer has been dismissed. This was on a length and outside off, hint of turn, Iyer stretches out and pushes it to the right of Watson at short cover. He goes for an non-existent single, he is halfway down the pitch, Pant sends him back. Not enough time to undo his steps. Dhoni delays taking the bails off. Bring on Thanos, please"
6.5,"Jadeja to Pant, 1 run","dragged short and outside off, Pant uses his feet and forces it down to long-on"
6.4,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","fired outside off, 100ks, hint of turn, driven with the spin to sweeper cover off the front foot"

5.1,"Watson to Pant, SIX runs","whoa, what a way to get off the mark. Length ball outside off, Pant plants his front leg, extends his hands, and punches it up and over the wide long-on boundary"
4.6,"Asif to Munro, OUT","The back-of-a-length ball works for Asif and CSK again. That's the right length to bowl here in Pune. Munro shimmies out again, Asif pulls his length back and attacks the body of Munro. He aims to slog it away but only toe-ends it to Karn at deep midwicket"
4.5,"Asif to Munro, SIX runs","banged in short and angling away outside off, Munro was waiting for this length. He upper-cuts it over Watson at slip for a flat six. The ball hits the ad boards on the flush"

4.1,"Asif to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length on the hips, 140.3ks, clipped away to long leg"
3.6,"Watson to Munro, FOUR runs","Munro shimmies out again, this time he clears mid-on. He manufactures a half-volley by venturing out of the crease. Dragged from outside off over mid-on. Munro did not middle it but he will not complain"
3.5,"Watson to Munro, no run","back of a length and outside off, Munro throws his bat at the ball  and misses"
3.4,"Watson to Munro, SIX runs","Watson errs too full and outside off, Munro shimmies out, picks it up and swats it across the line over midwicket. He watches the ball sail over the short leg-side boundary"
3.3,"Watson to Iyer, 1 run","straying into the pads, tucked away to fine leg"
3.2,"Watson to Iyer, 2 runs","Watson bangs it short and outside off, Iyer can't get on top of it. Splices a pull over midwicket"

2.6,"Ngidi to Iyer, no run","Iyer backs away again, Ngidi follows him and cramps him for room. Played back to the bowler"
2.5,"Ngidi to Iyer, FOUR runs",Iyer backs away outside leg and manufactures swinging room. Ngidi goes shorter and wider outside off. Iyer still reaches out and slaps it through the covers like a boss

1.5,"Asif to Iyer, no run","very full and attacking the stumps, 141.6ks, defended back"
1.4,"Asif to Shaw, OUT","Asif bounces out Shaw. He runs in hard and hits the pitch harder. Dug in short on off stump, 141.9ks, rushes Shaw into a pull. He is late onto it and splices an overhead catch to Jadeja, who runs to his right from mid-off and pouches it safely. CSK's gun fielder. CSK's specialist fielder? Asif soaks in his maiden IPL wicket"
1.3,"Asif to Shaw, FOUR runs","overpitched on middle at 140.7ks, Shaw stays still and belts it right over Munro's head for an authoritative four"
1.2,"Asif to Shaw, no run","bouncer, angled in on middle, 138.6ks, forces Shaw to duck under it"
1.1,"Asif to Shaw, FOUR runs","on a length and outside off, 139.7ks, Shaw lines up for a loft but miscues it off the toe end to the right of mid-off"
1.1,"Asif to Shaw, 1 wide",back of a length at 140ks but he slides it down the leg side for wide

19.6,"Boult to Dhoni, 2 runs","full outside off, Dhoni slaps it to the left of long-off to finish the innings and a 22-ball half-century"
19.5,"Boult to Dhoni, OUT","has that been dropped? Ok, wait, is that a runout? Yes, it is. Lots of things happened there. Dhoni got a glove as he tried to pull this short ball and Pant drops it after diving to his left. Rayudu, in the meantime, has crossed over to the other end enthusiastically looking for a single only to find that Dhoni hasn't so much as moved a toe. All he can do then is sprint back to his end but then Boult nails a direct hit"
19.4,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR runs","slapped right past the bowler. Boult, predictably, shortens his length, and Dhoni steps down the track and hammers it past the bowler's left"
19.3,"Boult to Dhoni, SIX runs",full toss again. These are all attempts at yorkers that are going horribly wrong. Daredevils having a tough time against the best death-overs batting unit this season. Dhoni swipes and pummels it over deep midwicket
19.2,"Boult to Rayudu, 1 run","low full toss outside off, drilled to long-off"
19.1,"Boult to Rayudu, no run","walks across outside off and tries to sweep but the ball sneaks past, just past the leg stump"
18.6,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, SIX runs","that's perhaps the biggest of the night. A full toss outside off, Dhoni whips it with powerful wrists and sends it soaring over backward square leg. Way, way back into the stands. Also ruins what had been a good over for Daredevils"
18.5,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, no run",left alone outside off but that's perfectly legal. Well inside the line
18.4,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","full outside off, carved away over the in-field to sweeper cover"
18.3,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, 1 run","full outside off, bottom-handed shovel to long-off"
18.2,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","low full toss outside off, walks across and mistimes an attempt at a heave to send it along the ground to wide long-on"
18.2,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, 1 wide",sees the batsman walk across and bowls it too wide outside his off-stump
18.1,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, 1 run","dropped. Colin Munro puts down a straightforward catch. He had to move a little to his left alright, but he did well to get behind it and then just lets it pop out. A mistimed pull from Dhoni that led to all of that drama"
17.6,"Plunkett to Rayudu, FOUR runs",now he swings blindly at a delivery outside off that's just short of a good length and gets an outside edge that flies between the keeper and a short third man that's more fine than usual
17.5,"Plunkett to Rayudu, SIX runs","huge strike. Too full, too straight, Rayudu advances and gets right underneath it before shovelling it straight over"
17.4,"Plunkett to Dhoni, 1 run","short on off, whips it away with a flat bat to backward square leg. Straight to the fielder but there aren't too many that can get one over on Dhoni when he decides to take off for a run"
17.3,"Plunkett to Rayudu, 1 run","slower length ball at 123.1ks, Rayudu makes a little room and slaps it through cover"
17.2,"Plunkett to Rayudu, FOUR runs","another early shuffle, and Daredevils honestly aren't doing enough to make late adjustments. It's a short of a length delivery that's just too straight, and Rayudu pulls to deep fine leg"
17.1,"Plunkett to Dhoni, 1 run","shortish outside off, gets on top of it and dabs it away towards short third man"
16.6,"Boult to Rayudu, no run",gets down to a reverse sweep but to the wrong length. It's a length ball outside off and the ball sneaks past
16.5,"Boult to Rayudu, FOUR runs","Rayudu takes a leaf out of Dhoni's book and walks across too. It's an attempted yorker gone wrong as it ends up being a low full toss. Rayudu doesn't quite muster up the same power as Dhoni but it's enough, nevertheless, to carry the ball to long-on"
16.4,"Boult to Dhoni, 1 run","again walks across even before Boult takes his jump. It's a length ball around middle and leg, and Dhoni flicks it away to the fine leg region"
16.3,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR runs",shuffles across early to a short ball and gets tucked up for room as a result as he gets a top-edge. Pulled through deep square leg
16.2,"Boult to Dhoni, SIX runs",more brawn from Dhoni. Another bottom-handed jab as the bowler overcompensates and bowls it fuller outside his off-stump. Smashed over long-on
16.1,"Boult to Dhoni, SIX runs","that's just been jabbed with brute force. A short delivery sitting up nicely around the sixth-stump channel, and Dhoni shovels a pull with terrific bottom-handed power"
15.6,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 run","really full on off stump, clipped through midwicket"
15.5,"Mishra to Dhoni, SIX runs","tossed up and spins away outside off, Dhoni races down the track, meets the pitch of this legbreak and launches it over the long-off boundary"

15.3,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 run","low full-toss on middle, Dhoni hangs back and simply bunts it down to long-on"
15.2,"Mishra to Dhoni, 2 runs","fired on a back of a length on middle, Dhoni steps out and hacks it to midwicket off the inside half. He tears back for the second"
15.1,"Mishra to Rayudu, 1 run","full legbreak, driven with the spin from outside off to sweeper cover"
14.6,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, no run","very full and outside off, 143.1ks, Dhoni opens the face and searches for the gap but drives the ball straight to backward point"
14.5,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","137.8ks full-toss on off, above the waist? Tight call. Spliced towards midwicket"
14.4,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, 2 runs","low full-toss outside off, forced away to the left of long-off"
14.3,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, 1 leg bye","dug in short and skidding into the body, Dhoni aims a pull and is caught in a tangle. He misses the ball but hares across for the leg bye even as Avesh runs in and swoops down on the ball. The throw from Avesh is so very wide of the stumps at the non-striker's end"
14.2,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","wide yorker, squeezed through the covers for one"
14.1,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, 1 run",Dhoni gets on top of a short ball outside off and punches through the line to the man on the sweeper boundary
13.6,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 run","full and flat on middle, driven along to long-off"
13.5,"Mishra to Watson, OUT","Mishra does well to float this up to Watson and entice him. But he's taken this away from him with some drift in the air, and it results in Watson skewing a lofted strike off the outside part of the bat. Into the hands of long-off"
13.4,"Mishra to Rayudu, 1 run",advances down the ground to a length ball and punches to long-on
13.3,"Mishra to Watson, 1 run","full on leg stump, clipped away behind square for one"
13.2,"Mishra to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, no turn as it comes on with the arm, pulled away to deep midwicket"
13.1,"Mishra to Rayudu, FOUR runs","full and sliding towards leg, Rayudu gets down and crunches a sweep through fine leg"
12.6,"Shankar to Watson, FOUR runs","another wide half-volley, Watson simply opens up his arms and smashes it through extra cover on the up"
12.6,"Shankar to Watson, 1 wide","full and shaping away, again too much drift away from the right-hander. Boundaries can do that to you"
12.5,"Shankar to Watson, FOUR runs","full toss that slips out of the hand, chases it and ekes out an outside edge that runs away to third man, beating deep backward point running to his left"
12.4,"Shankar to Rayudu, 1 run",Rayudu tries to slog from outside off and ends up dragging it down to long-on off the inside of the bat
12.4,"Shankar to Rayudu, 1 wide",sees the batsman advancing and takes it away from him but drifts away too much outside off
12.3,"Shankar to Rayudu, FOUR runs","full with enough room outside off, Rayudu steps down the track and shovels this over extra cover"
12.2,"Shankar to Rayudu, no run","same delivery this time, beaten for pace and room as he swings and misses"

11.3,"Maxwell to Watson, no run","fullish length around off, Watson nudges into the leg side"
11.2,"Maxwell to Rayudu, 1 run","full outside off, driven down to long-on"
11.1,"Maxwell to Raina, OUT","an ugly swipe across the line sees the back of Raina. Nicely floated up around his off-stump, and Raina is expecting it to turn away. But it simply slides in with the arm and beats the inside edge before clattering into off-stump"
10.6,"Shankar to Raina, 1 run",
10.5,"Shankar to du Plessis, OUT","du Plessis holes out to long-off. Not his most fluent inning, a run-a-ball 33 when the team's going nearly at 10 an over. Lofts this fuller one but the bat turns in his hands as long-off grabs it reverse-cupped"
10.4,"Shankar to du Plessis, 2 runs","another fuller ball, du Plessis heaves it over the extra cover region and it lands between that fielder running back and long-off running to his left"
10.3,"Shankar to du Plessis, no run","full, a little too wide of him, and he slashes and misses"
10.2,"Shankar to Watson, 1 run",another full toss but he can't maximise the free-hit. Shovels at it but without a lot of timing it only goes on the bounce to long-off
10.2,"Shankar to du Plessis, (no ball) 1 run",that's going to be a no-ball. Du Plessis pulls this high full toss into the hands of deep midwicket who doesn't have to move an inch. But that's well over waist height
10.1,"Shankar to Watson, 1 run",throws his hands at a fuller one outside off and drives uppishly to sweeper cover
9.6,"Mishra to Watson, 1 run","back of a length on off, leans back and punches down to wide long-on"

8.5,"Tewatia to Watson, 1 run",backs away and punches down to long-off
8.4,"Tewatia to Watson, SIX runs","fuller and on middle, Watson stretches out, meets the pitch and nails another slog-sweep, this sails waaaaay over midwicket. He has hit seven sixes already"
8.3,"Tewatia to du Plessis, 1 bye","slides in, Faf sweeps and misses"
8.2,"Tewatia to Watson, 1 run","quicker one, hit down to long-on"
8.1,"Tewatia to Watson, SIX runs","half-tracker on leg stump, feeds Watson's strength again. Watson drops down to one knee and smokes a slog-sweep over square leg. Raina stands up and applauds from the dug out. Watson raises a 25-ball fifty"
7.6,"Mishra to du Plessis, 2 runs","quick wrong'un, following Faf who was jumping outside leg, cramps him for room, jabbed to mid-off"

6.3,"Plunkett to Watson, SIX runs","overpitched and outside off, looks like a cross-seamer, Watson lunges forward, gets under the length and launches it over Plunkett's head. Watson holds his shape like a boss"

6.1,"Plunkett to Watson, 1 run","full and wide outside off, Watson stretches out and slices a single down to third man"
5.6,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, FOUR runs","140.5ks, short and angled into the body, Faf is tucked up for room. He miscues a pull but does it fine of short fine leg to close out the Powerplay with four. Just like that CSK have taken 31 off the last two overs"

5.4,"Avesh Khan to Watson, 1 run","good length and angling into the pads, twirled away through square leg"
5.3,"Avesh Khan to Watson, no run","follows the short ball with a full inswinger, jammed out"
5.2,"Avesh Khan to Watson, SIX runs","Watson has top-edged it and fetches a six. Chest-high short ball outside off, Watson can't get on top of the bounce. He swings his hands at a pull anyway and skies it to Mars. It drops down beyond the wide long-on boundary"
5.1,"Avesh Khan to Watson, no run","on a length and outside off, sticks in the pitch, dabbed to point"
4.6,"Plunkett to du Plessis, SIX runs","on a length and outside off, but Faf had jumped across off even before Plunkett had delivered. Merrily scooped away fine of short fine leg. "

4.4,"Plunkett to Watson, SIX runs","very full and veering into the pads, Watson picks it up, twirls his wrists and lifts it over midwicket. He exploits the short leg-side boundary, again"
4.3,"Plunkett to Watson, SIX runs","hip-high short ball outside off, you've got to get it up higher, Mr. Plunkett. Watson lines it up and pulls it disdainfully over the midwicket boundary. Bam!"

4.1,"Plunkett to du Plessis, 1 run","short and skidding into the leg stump, turned to square leg for one"

2.6,"Boult to Watson, no run","141ks full-toss wide outside off, Watson reaches out for the ball but misses again. Dhoni slapped a similar full-toss over the point boundary the other night at the Chinnaswamy"
2.5,"Boult to Watson, no run","pretty full and zipping through outside off at nearly 143ks, Watson has a big drive at it and only collects fresh air"
2.4,"Boult to Watson, FOUR runs","deft touch from Watson. 142.7ks, back of a length and outside off, Watson uses the pace of Boult to his advantage and glides it to the left of backward point for four"
2.3,"Boult to du Plessis, 1 leg bye","good length and zipping into the pads from around the stumps, the ball is skipping off the pitch, deflected away to fine leg"
2.2,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","pitched up and slanting away outside off, lovely flow of the hands through the line but Faf's drive finds cover"
2.1,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs","full and angling away wide outside off, Faf reaches out for the ball with his hands and carves it away fine of deep third man. Beats Avesh to his left in the deep"

1.3,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, no run",hustled for pace. This cut back in from length to beat the inside edge and hit him high on the thigh pad. There was a stifled appeal but this was going over.
1.2,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, no run","beaten by a fiery back of length delivery outside off, superb carry. He's hitting 140kph plus already"

0.3,"Boult to Watson, no run","pitched up at off, presses forward and pushes to cover"
0.2,"Boult to Watson, FOUR runs","lbw appeal followed by a four. Another inswinger, veers onto the pads, picked off to the square leg boundary"
0.1,"Boult to Watson, no run","all action first-up. Inswinger from Trent Boult. Not given. Iyer reviews. Good length and snakes back in, Watson plays around his front pad - like he has done for the most of his career - and is pinned below the knee-roll. Pitching in line: check. Hitting the stumps: check. The tracker returns three reds. There was an inside edge but bat first or pad first? There is no conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field not-out call. This was really tight but Watson survives in the end"
19.1,"Yadav to Gill, FOUR runs","Gill hits the winning runs, takes his helmet off immediately and swings his bat in the air with his right arm, such passion! Gets a hug from Lynn. Short and wide, he stays on top the ball and cuts it square and fast"
18.6,"Siraj to Gill, 1 run",little full towards the pads and it's worked to leg for one
18.5,"Siraj to Karthik, OUT","what a catch by Kohli! DK lofted it straight down yet again, Kohli's eyes spot it and he sprints across full speed in front and to his left from long on. Puts in a full-length dive just in time and gets both his hands under the ball"
18.4,"Siraj to Karthik, no run","he's hitting those drives and pulls so well, tries a reverse paddle now and misses"
18.3,"Siraj to Karthik, 2 runs","lands it short this time, and DK pulls it square for two more"
18.2,"Siraj to Karthik, SIX runs","oh my, how did he hit that! It was a short of length ball, mid off was in and DK lofted it straight over his head for a six!"
18.1,"Siraj to Karthik, 2 runs","slices that one high on the off side and it lands beyond backward point, wide of sweeper cover for two"
17.6,"Southee to Lynn, 2 runs","low full toss lofted down the ground, long off runs to his right and they come back for the second easily"
17.5,"Southee to Karthik, 1 run",chips the fullish ball down to long on
17.4,"Southee to Karthik, FOUR runs","it's a slow and short cutter, short enough for DK to pivot on the back foot and pull it fine behind square. It's beaten depe fine leg too. The captain is not wasting any time here"
17.3,"Southee to Karthik, 2 runs","We have a direct hit and the third umpire comes into play, but he's safe. DK closed the face of the bat to tuck the ball to leg with soft hands and said ""two"" repeatedly as Vohra rain in from the leg side, they can back just in time"
17.2,"Southee to Lynn, 1 run","full and wide, drives that away to deep cover for one"
17.1,"Southee to Lynn, FOUR runs",the big back lift sees the low full toss with a wobbly seam outside off and he whacks it straight down to beat long on. Strong arms and shoulders coming into play
16.6,"Siraj to Karthik, FOUR runs","two full to DK, he brings out the cover drive and drills that along the ground, just wide of deep cover. Four!"
16.5,"Siraj to Karthik, 2 runs","Southee has a shy at the stumps from point, he can see only one of them and he misses as Lynn is miles away, he finally makes it and then even comes back for the overthrow. DK drove that straight to point and took off, Lynn wasn't sure and was nearly stuck on the pitch but DK was a long way down before Southee misses. No back up, little more mix up and that's two runs"
16.4,"Siraj to Lynn, 1 run",gets the wide yorker right this time and Lynn jams his bat in for a single to deep point
16.4,"Siraj to Lynn, 1 wide","sends a wide on the off side, outside the tramlines"
16.3,"Siraj to Russell, OUT","gone first ball on his 30th birthday! The crowd has come alive, I tell you. Siraj banged it in and Russell went hard at it with a swing of the arms, got only a top edge and de Kock ran a long way back to complete a superb catch"
16.2,"Siraj to Rana, FOUR runs","Chahal gets to the ball but it's gone for four! It was full outside off, Rana jammed his bat in to steer it just behind square to make Chahal run to his left from third man. He rolled to get his hands on the ball, but it went through"
16.1,"Siraj to Lynn, 1 run",uses a strong bottom hand to drill that through the covers. Have to settle for one
16.1,"Siraj to Lynn, 1 wide",tries the wide yorker and it's gone a bit too wide
15.6,"Ashwin to Rana, FOUR runs",goes down on a knee as the ball turns in and he paddle-scoops that fine and high to the fine-leg boundary
15.5,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 bye","tries to sweep that one from waaayy outside off against th turn and QdK can't hold on to it, bye"
15.4,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run",
15.3,"Ashwin to Rana, 2 runs","excellent running effort to catch that at deep cover but it's jut out of his reach! Rana didn't pick that googly, he miscued that with a leading edge and it went very high, Umesh ran a long way to his left, put in a dive but can't blame him for not taking that"
15.2,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run",sweeps that to chip it in the air towards the vacant area in square leg
15.1,"Ashwin to Lynn, no run","superb wrong'un, Lynn sweeps as usual and that turns in dangerously to just miss the off stump"
14.6,"Southee to Rana, no run","chops the ball off the back foot to point and say ""no"""
14.5,"Southee to Lynn, 1 run",tucks the ball with the angle to leg for one
14.4,"Southee to Rana, 1 run","pivots on the back foot to pull, it's a slow bouncer and Rana mistimes it completely, it hits his arm and they run across for one"
14.3,"Southee to Lynn, 1 run","big heave for the fullish ball around off, doesn't middle but sends it to long on"
14.2,"Southee to Rana, 1 run",short enough for Rana to stay back and punch it square for one
14.1,"Southee to Rana, no run","looked like an offcutter outside off, Rana gets a thick inside edge to cover"
13.6,"Chahal to Rana, 1 run","too short, Rana rocks back and pulls it to deep midwicket"
13.5,"Chahal to Lynn, 1 run",sweeps away to bring up his fifty with that single
13.4,"Chahal to Lynn, 2 runs","excellent effort from Umesh at deep fine leg. The flat delivery on middle and leg was swept again and past short fine leg, Umesh ran across from deep backward square and rolled along to get both hands on it"
13.3,"Chahal to Lynn, no run","reverse-sweeps this time from middle and leg, straight to short third man"
13.2,"Chahal to Lynn, no run","full delivery just outside off, misses the sweep this time, good reply from Chahal"
13.1,"Chahal to Lynn, FOUR runs","a bit too short and Lynn puts his knee down and sweeps that with some power, from outside off and it's raced to the square-leg boundary. Wasn't too far from the umpire"
12.6,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run",he is sweeping everything. Pitched up outside off but Lynn plants his long leg across and sweeps
12.5,"Ashwin to Lynn, no run","much flatter and quicker, Lynn tries to sweep again and misses!"
12.4,"Ashwin to Lynn, 2 runs",sweeps it in the air  but it lands safely beyond square leg as Lynn went a fair bit across to off
12.3,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run",a wrong'un around off and he goes back to push it into the covers for one
12.2,"Ashwin to Uthappa, OUT","the flight has worked, he holes out to long on! It was pitched up with a lot of revs, Uthappa got near the ball nicely, struck it hard and straight but Southee was waiting there at long on with his long arms. Ashwin is pumped!"
12.2,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 wide","too much flight, too wide outside off with the turn and it's a wide"
12.1,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run","nicely flighted outside off, Lynn moves towards the ball and bunts it down to long on"
11.6,"Yadav to Uthappa, SIX runs","two from five balls and a short ball to end the over. That's sailed over square leg into the crowd! Uthappa did a little pivot on the back foot for the short one, and opened himself up to pull-swat that away"
11.5,"Yadav to Uthappa, no run","nice and straight towards the off stump, Uthappa says 'wait' after steering that to midwicket"
11.4,"Yadav to Lynn, 1 run","short and wide at 113kmh, thrashed to deep point with those strong arms"
11.3,"Yadav to Lynn, no run",that's a mean bouncer towards Lynn and he just about sways his head out of the line of the ball. One for the over
11.2,"Yadav to Uthappa, 1 run",runs the short of length ball down to third man nicely
11.1,"Yadav to Uthappa, no run",starts with a full delivery and Uthappa drives it back
10.6,"Chahal to Uthappa, 1 run",brings it shorter and he goes back in the crease to whip it to leg for one
10.5,"Chahal to Uthappa, no run","beaten outside off! Beautiful leg break from Chahal around middle and off, tempting Uthappa to lean forward and defend, and then it turns away past the outside edge"
10.4,"Chahal to Lynn, 1 run",takes a step towards the off side and sweeps it hard against the spin to deep midwicket
10.3,"Chahal to Uthappa, 1 run",pushes this one with the turn to off for one
10.2,"Chahal to Uthappa, SIX runs",what a beauty! You pitch it up to Uthappa and he will swing that bat absolutely straight and with such elegance. It goes straight and high for six
10.1,"Chahal to Lynn, 1 run",sweeps that one from outside leg to deep fine leg right from the middle of the bat
9.6,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run","shortish again, pulled again but to deep midwicket this time"
9.5,"Ashwin to Lynn, FOUR runs","too short, pulled in the gap, not with much power and four more! Lynn went down on a knee when he saw the short ball and hit that one right between long leg and deep midwicket"
9.4,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run",leans into the legbreak and pushes it to cover for one
9.3,"Ashwin to Uthappa, FOUR runs",Ashwin pitches this one shorter and Uthappa reverse-sweeps this one in the air and wide of Kohli to the third man area. Four more for the placement
9.2,"Ashwin to Uthappa, FOUR runs","what timing and wrist work! Bit too full on the pads and he used those supple wrists so, so nicely to flick it and that bisected long on and deep midwicket. Rolled all along the ground"
9.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, no run",reverse sweeps it straight to Kohli at slip after it was pitched up on off by Ashwin
8.6,"Siraj to Lynn, no run","slower one bordering on the wide line, not called a wide and Siraj must be relieved"
8.5,"Siraj to Uthappa, 1 run",taps this one square on the off side for a quick single
8.4,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR runs","short fine leg dives but it goes through him! Siraj angled it a bit too much into the batsman and Uthappa did well to glance it fine, although it should have been stopped"
8.3,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run","looked like he rolled his fingers over that one, on length around off and Uthappa finds Umesh at cover"
8.2,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run","back of length and angling into him, Uthappa defends it back"
8.1,"Siraj to Lynn, 1 run",pulls the short ball but doesn't get hold of it and gets a single to long on
8.1,"Siraj to Lynn, 1 wide","bangs in a bouncer at 143, too high and called wide"
7.6,"Ashwin to Uthappa, no run",beats him on the last ball with a beautiful leg break from length on middle and leg and there's good turn to take the ball past the outside edge
7.5,"Ashwin to Uthappa, SIX runs","de Grandhomme at the same position, long on for right-hander, he jumps with a big stretch near the rope and just gets a hand to it. Was really really tough after Uthappa lofted it straight almost effortlessly"
7.4,"Ashwin to Uthappa, no run",turns it a mile outside off! Uthappa went back in the crease to asses the turn and couldn't get close to it eventually
7.3,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run",bit of flight outside off and Lynn paddles it away to long leg
7.2,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run",the ball turns into him and he tucks it off the back foot to leg to get off the mark
7.1,"Ashwin to Narine, OUT","strikes first ball, Narine holes out to long off! Tall man de Grandhomme takes a couple steps back at long off and raises his arms over his head to grab the ball and just keeps his feet inside the boundary. It was pitched up, Narine went straight down the ground but didn't get enough for this small ground"
6.6,"Siraj to Lynn, no run",full on middle and leg now and worked to midwicket. He sends Narine back
6.5,"Siraj to Lynn, FOUR runs",shot ball outside off and Lynn scythes it mercilessly behind square on the off side. That raced to the boundary in no time!
6.4,"Siraj to Lynn, no run","angles it in nicely towards the stumps, Lynn blocks it back"

6.1,"Siraj to Narine, 1 wide",starts the over with a bouncer on the leg side
5.6,"Chahal to Lynn, no run","oh so close! What a delivery. Drift, flight, dip at off stump. Lynn backs into the off side and looks to swipe over the infield. It fizzes past off stump as he misses"
5.5,"Chahal to Lynn, no run","short of a length outside off, punched to extra cover"
5.4,"Chahal to Lynn, FOUR runs","slaughtered. Lynn slowly getting back to his best. Length ball on off stump, backs away into the leg side this time. Exposes the stumps and drives over extra cover on the up"
5.3,"Chahal to Lynn, no run",length ball at off. Very slow. Look to sweep and cops this on the back the thigh
5.2,"Chahal to Lynn, no run","length ball at leg stump, exposes the stumps and sweeps as this spins towards him. Gets it straight to short fine"
5.1,"Chahal to Lynn, no run",beaten. Nicely bowled. Length ball turning away from outside off. He's not to the pitch as he looks to drive
4.6,"Yadav to Narine, no run",bouncer at leg stump. Awkwardly defended
4.5,"Yadav to Lynn, 1 run","slower ball, length and width on it outside off. Slapped straight to cover point who misfields"
4.4,"Yadav to Lynn, SIX runs","shot! Lynn with the quality! Predicts the line and length again, has his front leg out of the way, a strong base as he waits like a boxer. Umesh delivers, full at off stump, and he bludgeons this straight and flats"
4.3,"Yadav to Lynn, no run",bouncer outside off. Looks to climb into the pull but it's an inside edge to short midwicket
4.2,"Yadav to Lynn, no run",yorker outside off. Backs away but can't get this drive away. Jammed back down the pitch
4.1,"Yadav to Lynn, FOUR runs","looks to go straight, looks to go full. Lynn knows and is backing away. Makes room and clubs it wide of mid-off after taking it on the full"

3.5,"Chahal to Narine, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, looks to slog, thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
3.4,"Chahal to Lynn, 1 run","dropped! Kohli has his face covered at slip as M Ashwin puts down a sitter at extra cover. Chahal has done superbly to induce a leading edge from Lynn -  a dipping legbreak at off stump that he looks to lift over midwicket. There was no pressure on Ashwin, apart from anything he put on himself. He got under it, couldn't complete it"
3.3,"Chahal to Lynn, no run","length ball outside off, looks to sweep and gets an inside edge onto pad. Loud appeal for lbw from the bowler, turned down"
3.2,"Chahal to Lynn, no run",inside edge onto pad. He hasn't picked the flipper. No forward press as he punches late at this length ball on off
3.1,"Chahal to Lynn, FOUR runs",nicely placed. Length ball outside off. A legbreak. Not too full. And there's bounce on it. But Lynn shuffles and sweeps from under it to get four at long leg
2.6,"Southee to Narine, no run",slower ball at a length. Back down the pitch off the inside edge as he looks to heave
2.5,"Southee to Narine, 2 runs","lifts it just over the infield on the off side. No, we have not switched to permanent bold tags to start commentary lines. Narine living on the edge but doing a great job. Couldn't quite get under this overpitched bal and got it over cover off the toe-end"
2.4,"Southee to Narine, no run",beaten outside off as he slashes on the up against an offcutter. It's on a length and lifting past the outside edge rapidly
2.4,"Southee to Narine, 1 wide","bouncer. Too short, too high, and a touch down leg side. The perfect wide?"
2.3,"Southee to Narine, no run",fends aerially but there's no short leg. Of course. Another well-directed bouncer
2.2,"Southee to Narine, FOUR runs","clears mid-on! Will Royal Challenges ever figure this guy out? Even when they have a plan, it isn't working. Short of a length ball, he backs away and swings it over the diving McCullum off the toe-end"
2.1,"Southee to Narine, FOUR runs","top edge over short fine. Goes down leg side along with the bouncer, swings from under it. Clears the infield"
1.6,"Yadav to Narine, 1 run","slices it but no one to take it as it lands near short midwicket! Narine can't get the hook away against a quick bouncer. It looks like Umesh has pulled something in his leg, because this wasn't too far from him for the catch. He couldn't get anywhere near it"
1.5,"Yadav to Narine, no run",changes it up. Low full toss outside off and Narine looks to run it past point with an open face. It lands in front of him on the bounce
1.4,"Yadav to Lynn, 1 run",full. Angled in at leg stump. Backs away and taps it to mid-off
1.3,"Yadav to Narine, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, dabs it into the covers with soft hands and steals a single"
1.2,"Yadav to Narine, FOUR runs",using that pace again. Short of a length again. Time for him to get leg side of this and lift it over short third man off the thick outside edge
1.1,"Yadav to Narine, SIX runs","shot! What a shot! Umesh offers a length ball in the corridor, with all his pace. Narine is grateful for it on this slow pitch. Stands tall, merely taps from under this and sends it over long-off"
0.6,"Southee to Narine, 1 run",skies a slower ball but it clears mid-on and lands wide of long-off. Another offuctter but this one is back of a length. Narine wants to swat over midwicket but this goes away from him
0.6,"Southee to Narine, 1 wide",another bouncer. Giving nothing to Narine today. He's hurried as he backs away to try and pull. Beaten but that's given wide on height
0.5,"Southee to Narine, no run",falls short of Kohli who runs to his left and in front after Narine awkwardly fends this short ball uppishly. Another slower short ball. Kohli runs from slip but this sneaks through from under
0.4,"Southee to Lynn, 1 run","finds some swing this time, but he can't get this to pitch. A floaty full toss outside off and he crunches it on the bounce to long-off"
0.3,"Southee to Narine, 1 run",slower short ball in the corridor. Climbs on top of it and dabs to backward poit
0.2,"Southee to Lynn, 1 run",full and straight. Lynn gets his legs out of the way and jams it to mid-on. Siraj fires a low-arm throw and the ball rolls through to the keeper who is backing up
0.1,"Southee to Lynn, no run","full ball at middle stump. Looking for the shape away from there, but there's none on that first ball. Lynn taps it back to the bowler"
19.6,"Johnson to Kohli, SIX runs",anticipates the slower ball going across him and shuffles right into the off side. Mitch drops this cutter shorter than the others. This means Kohli's momentum moving backwards can be used to spring at the ball as it climbs up at his hips. He duly lofts it over deep backward square
19.5,"Johnson to Kohli, no run","beaten again with the offcutter. Hits back of a length, finds grip and climb as Kohli brings out a square drive on the up"
19.4,"Johnson to Grandhomme, 1 bye","beaten by the offcutter this time. At a length, not the worst ball to play that same shot again. But he looks to club this over midwicket this time"
19.3,"Johnson to Grandhomme, SIX runs","carved over sweeper cover! Poor length from Mitch, but it's an offcutter so this is not an easy shot. CDG gets leg side of it, uses his reach to get under and puts in a lot of core strength to clear the fielder"
19.2,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run",sweetly timed but Karthik has the field set for the full wide ball. Gets on his knee for this square drive and finds deep backward point
19.1,"Johnson to Kohli, 2 runs","overpitched outside off, looks to pummel this down the ground but as he's done all evening, he goes too hard at it and it trickles past the non-striker off the toe-end"
18.6,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, 1 run","short ball outside off, cuts to sweeper cover off the bottom of the bat"
18.6,"Shivam Mavi to Grandhomme, 2 wide",beaten outside off by a nicely done legcutter. But it has just gone wide of the marker. They sneak a run
18.5,"Shivam Mavi to Grandhomme, 2 runs","short ball at off stump. Gets deep in the crease and pulls it to deep midwicket's right . Rinku Singh puts in the slide, keeps it to two"
18.4,"Shivam Mavi to Grandhomme, 2 runs",sliced to long-off's left. Another full toss. The old low full toss. Can't get a swing under this
18.3,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, 1 run","sweetly timed, but not adequately placed. Overpitched ball just outside off and he gets it along the floor to long-off"
18.2,"Shivam Mavi to Grandhomme, 1 run",yorker. Nicely done. No room at all this time and he jams it out to sweeper cover
18.1,"Shivam Mavi to Grandhomme, no run","misses a full toss. So much for my build up, Mr. CDG. It's juciy, knee-height, with plenty of room outside off and he completely misses it"
17.6,"Russell to Kohli, SIX runs","yes. Yes, yes, yes. That bottom-handed whip again. Wide of long-on. Russell misses his length yet again and despite this being a slower ball, he is punished. Kohli barely moves his feet to get this right off the middle"
17.5,"Russell to Kohli, 2 runs",short of a length and up at middle stump. Mistimed pulled again. Off the high part of the bat and to Mavi's left at deep midwicket. That's fifty
17.4,"Russell to Kohli, 2 runs",Kohli shuffles because there's a chance behind square on the leg side. But this yorker is perfectly done. Gets him at off stump. He jams it wide of long-on to come back for the second
17.3,"Russell to Mandeep, OUT","Mavi keeps his cool at deep midwicket, and takes this with a reverse cup right at the edge. Mandeep hits the pull nicely, to be fair. But the elevation is missing and it's a smart catch"
17.2,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","short ball outside off, looks to clobber this cut, but loses shape and timing because of it. Gets it straight to extra cover"
17.1,"Russell to Kohli, SIX runs",
16.6,"Narine to Mandeep, SIX runs","lovely! Mandeep hasn't had too much of the strike but he's been very productive with it in this over. Skidder at a length outside off, with some swing in. Stays deep in the crease and gets his bottom hand under this to whip it over long-on"
16.5,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","short ball at middle stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
16.4,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run",short and turning into the body. Punches to long-on off the back footsh
16.3,"Narine to Mandeep, SIX runs","swatted over deep midwicket. Mandeep has nailed this slog sweep against the offbreak. Good stride, clean hit. That's the fifty partnership"
16.2,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","very short ball on the stumps, mistimes the pull shot and it lands short of deep midwicket. Not done very well against half trackers this season "
16.1,"Narine to Kohli, no run","short of a length outside off, punched straight to cover point"
15.6,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, 1 run","full outside off, gets the front foot stride out and drives to sweeper cover"
15.5,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, no run","short of a length and wide outside off. Slaps it on the up, straight to extra cover"
15.4,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, FOUR runs","shot. Pace, width. Everything you need on this pitch. Waits for it to arrive again and guides it over point"
15.3,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, no run",length ball lifting up as he looks to punch to long-on. Can't get it off the pitch
15.2,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, no run","short ball going away wide outside off, beaten as he looks to open the face and get this square"
15.1,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, FOUR runs",superb. It's a different game when the pacers are one. Even though they're bowling cutters. It's a length ball wide outside off. He waits for it to arrive and chops it between backward point and short third man
14.6,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run",length and coming in again. Taps through square leg off the back foot
14.5,"Narine to Kohli, no run",length ball spinning into middle. Gets an inside edge onto pad as he looks to flick
14.4,"Narine to Kohli, no run",cramped as this length ball spins into him. Can't get bat on the whip
14.3,"Narine to Kohli, 2 runs",length ball whipped in front of deep midwicke from the stumps
14.2,"Narine to Kohli, 2 runs","sensational fielding by Russell at long-on to stop a typical Kohli whip down the ground. He sprints to his left, rotates anticlockwise and stops this ball behind him, one yard in front of the boundary"
14.1,"Narine to Kohli, FOUR runs","sliced over extra cover. Not timed well at all from Kohli. It's a length ball going away off the pitch. He wants to go in that direction, but the poor connection means it's one bounce and into the boundary"
13.6,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run",slower ball at a length on off stump. Steps out and drives to long-off
13.5,"Johnson to Mandeep, 1 run",sliced uppishly to sweeper cover. Length ball slanted across him and he meets it on the up
13.4,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run",bouncer at his helmet. Doesn't come on smoothly. Hooks to deep square off the inside half of the bat
13.3,"Johnson to Mandeep, 1 run",leading edge but safe. Short of a length at middle stump and he closes the face too early on the flick. Sweeper cover cleans up
13.2,"Johnson to Kohli, 1 run",another offcutter. At a length and across the corridor. Steers it to third man off the front foot
13.1,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs","oh yeah! Gimme that, he says. It's an offcutter, but the pace is enough. Waits for this length ball outside off, leans in to meet it on the up and punch it past extra cover"
12.6,"Kuldeep to Mandeep, no run",beaten. Unplayable right now. Googly goes high enough in the air before landing that Mandeep expects it to bounce as it goes past him. Brings out the late cut but is well beaten
12.5,"Kuldeep to Mandeep, no run","length outside off, steered to point"
12.4,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","slugs it off the inside half of the bat. Kuldeep has Kohli in some bother tonight. Another loopy one has Kohli excited, but the slog sweep is not timed well at all. Trickles out to deep midwicket"
12.3,"Kuldeep to Mandeep, 1 run","tossed up at off stump, gets on the front foot and drives to long-off"
12.2,"Kuldeep to Mandeep, no run","beaten by big turn again. A googly, pitched short and outside off. Turns even further away as Mandeep shapes to pull"
12.1,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 leg bye",big turn into the pads. Kohli can't get bat as he looks to flick off the back foot
11.6,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","length ball outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
11.5,"Russell to Kohli, FOUR runs","glorious from Kohli. Leans into this full ball outside off, makes use of the allowance - mid-off is in - and makes him fetch it. Hobbles immediately after. Looks like an ankle thing."
11.4,"Russell to Mandeep, 1 run",dropped! Mandeep's attempted ramp is poorly timed. It looks like Russell's getting bouncers to stick in the pitch. It's a lob that goes behind Rana who is at fly slip and he can't hold on after pedalling backwards and tumbling
11.3,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","slower ball, back of a length outside off. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
11.2,"Russell to Mandeep, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, nudged through square leg off the back foot"
11.1,"Russell to Mandeep, no run",swing in at off stump from back of a length. Mandeep looks to steer it to third man but can't get it past the keeper
11.1,"Russell to Mandeep, 1 wide",full and very wide outside off. Russell got some swing on that one too
10.6,"Kuldeep to Kohli, no run","googly, back of a length at middle stump. Tapped to midwicket off the back foot"
10.5,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 2 runs",half-tracker and he gets an inside edge after getting on the back foot for a pull. Was really looking to launch this. Ended up getting two runs down at fine leg
10.4,"Kuldeep to Kohli, no run",leading edge. This is why Kohli is tentative against Kuldeep. Hasn't picked this googly as he looks to flick through midwicket
10.3,"Kuldeep to Mandeep, 1 run","googly, short of a length and going away from off stump. Gets on the back foot and tickles it through square leg"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","full on middle stump, and yet another watchful drive from Kohli. This one to long-on"
10.1,"Kuldeep to Kohli, no run",good length ball turning in at the stumps. Tapped to midwicket
9.6,"Russell to Vohra, OUT","gone! A full toss! Vohra skips down the pitch and gets a shin height full toss tailing in at him that is ripe for a drilling through midwicket. It's what he was looking to do as well. Except, there's a gap between bat and pad and the inside edge sneaks through to smash the stumps oh it takes his back boot on the way too"
9.6,"Russell to Vohra, 1 wide","another bouncer. Slower ball too, it appears. But it's too high for him to connect"
9.5,"Russell to McCullum, OUT","got him! Through the hook shot too early, is McCullum, and he ends up getting a feather off the toe of the bat which carries comfortably to the keeper. A short ball and he made plenty of room for the swing, but the timing is just off"
9.4,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length in the corridor, allows it to come on and guides towards third man off the face of the bat"
9.3,"Russell to McCullum, 1 run",falls short of long-off. Length ball just outside off. He can't get elevation as he looks to loft this straight
9.2,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run",short of a length and some shape way off the pitch. Follows with his hands and jabs it past point
9.1,"Russell to McCullum, 1 run",steps out and creams a square drive straight to sweeper cover. A full ball wide outside off and he steps out to get this out there
8.6,"Kuldeep to Kohli, no run",length ball tossed up at off stump and nervous flick straight to short midwicket
8.5,"Kuldeep to McCullum, 1 run","length ball at the stumps, dragged into the leg side with a heave"
8.4,"Kuldeep to McCullum, no run","googly, pushed at a length and wide outside off. Looks to slog sweep, misses"
8.3,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run",loses control against this loopy ball from Kuldeep. Looks like a googly. Kohli has to wait a long time after shaping to flick and ends up chipping to long-off
8.2,"Kuldeep to McCullum, 1 leg bye","length ball on middle stump, presses well froward and gets deflects this into the leg side with a bat-pad"
8.1,"Kuldeep to de Kock, OUT","aesthetically beauty is where de Kock's inside-out loft over extra cover stops. He's not fully to the pitch and as a result, he's ended up slicing a very good looking shot to sweeper's left. The fielder runs a few yards to his left and watches carefully before completing the catch"
7.6,"Chawla to McCullum, SIX runs","short again, not sure what Chawla is trying here! Forget the off side, McCullum rocks back this time and pulls it high and wide over long-on"
7.5,"Chawla to McCullum, no run",tries to find the gap again with a back-foot cut and finds point this time
7.4,"Chawla to McCullum, FOUR runs","shorter and quicker, and it's short enough to give McCullum the time to go back and chop it between point and short third man"
7.3,"Chawla to McCullum, FOUR runs","beaten but he gets four! Flatter one on the middle stump and it turned just enough to deceive McCullum, but he made a late adjustment and got it fine on the off side"
7.2,"Chawla to de Kock, 1 run","tries to loft it with the turn this time, doesn't quite middle it but gets one to deep midwicket"
7.1,"Chawla to de Kock, no run","hardly turns around the leg stump, de Kock tries the reverse sweep but doesn't connect at all"
6.6,"Kuldeep to McCullum, SIX runs",spoils the over for Kuldeep! It was pitched up a bit and McCullum slog-swept that one with the turn over the fielder at deep midwicket!
6.5,"Kuldeep to de Kock, 1 run","Kuldeep bowls this one much slower as de Kock comes down, he waits and cuts yet again"
6.4,"Kuldeep to McCullum, 1 run","a fumble at deep midwicket, KKR's fielding still a beat wobbly. McCullum had swept this one with the turn to the leg side"
6.3,"Kuldeep to de Kock, 1 run",a touch fuller and he goes back in the crease again to cut it square
6.2,"Kuldeep to de Kock, 2 runs","slow and on length outside off, de Kock waits for it to turn and then cuts it past point for one"
6.1,"Kuldeep to McCullum, 1 run",pitches the first one short and McCullum pulls it to deep midwicket
5.6,"Shivam Mavi to McCullum, 1 run","low full toss at 146kmh, driven hard and fast to mid off where birthday boy Russell dives and saves a few"
5.5,"Shivam Mavi to McCullum, no run","away-swinging bouncer outside off, he tries to reach out for it but misses. That's the first bouncer for the over"
5.4,"Shivam Mavi to de Kock, 1 run",tries the same delivery but it's a low full toss this time and de Kock slices it to deep point
5.3,"Shivam Mavi to de Kock, no run","145kmh, a wide yorker outside off, de Kock stretches out and only gets a bottom edge"
5.2,"Shivam Mavi to McCullum, 1 run",shares down to make it a half volley on the off stump and smashes it along the ground to deep point
5.1,"Shivam Mavi to de Kock, 1 leg bye","tries to loft the ball off his pads, it was fullish, but he can't get bat on it"
4.6,"Narine to de Kock, 1 run","top edge as he sweeps, goes right behind DK on the leg side and they take one"
4.5,"Narine to de Kock, no run","extra bounce as he goes back to cut on off, DK also can't collect it"
4.4,"Narine to de Kock, FOUR runs","pitched up, he heaves to the leg side and doesn't quite middle it but gets enough to make it past midwicket and deep square leg"
4.3,"Narine to de Kock, no run",flat bats the short ball back to Narine
4.2,"Narine to McCullum, 1 leg bye","much slower than what McCullum expected, he's through with this sweep when the ball reaches him and takes it on the pad outside off"
4.1,"Narine to de Kock, 1 run","offbreak outside off, slices it to backward point and they sprint across for a quick one"
3.6,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","reverse sweeps it straight to short third man, quiet end to the over with three dots"
3.5,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","usual leg break, which hardly spins, much slower on the off stump and he defends again"
3.4,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","darts in one at 122.4kmh according to the TV, it was on off stump and McCullum did well to get his bat down in time"
3.3,"Chawla to de Kock, 1 run","short outside off, he cuts off the back foot and gets one as Kuldeep misfields at point. Looked like a wrong'un"
3.2,"Chawla to McCullum, 1 run","on middle and leg now, he pushes it towards mid on for one"
3.1,"Chawla to McCullum, FOUR runs",nobody on the leg side in the deep and McCullum reaches out from outside off to sweep the googly to deep midwicket for a one-bounce four
2.6,"Johnson to de Kock, SIX runs","makes width because the ball doesn't have any, he lofts the full delivery from the stumps, up and over the off side to the square boundary all the way"
2.5,"Johnson to de Kock, no run","pretty full on the off stump, de Kock closes the face of the bat to drive it straght to mid on"
2.4,"Johnson to McCullum, 1 run","length delivery on the stumps, McCullum makes some room and pushes into the covers"
2.4,"Johnson to McCullum, 1 wide",comes down again and Mitch tries a slower one this time but down leg for a wide
2.3,"Johnson to McCullum, FOUR runs","dances down the tack, Mitch bangs it in short and McCullum smacks it with a full swing on the off side for a cracking four"
2.2,"Johnson to de Kock, 1 run",tries to slog the incoming delivery towards his legs and he only gets an inside edge to leg
2.1,"Johnson to McCullum, 1 run","innocuous looking ball on the pads, McCullum tucks it carefully to leg for one"
1.6,"Narine to de Kock, no run","some width on the off side, he pushes it to cover point and comes back in time"
1.5,"Narine to de Kock, no run",tries to sweep again but gets an edge back to the bowler
1.4,"Narine to de Kock, FOUR runs",same shot but on the other side and same result. Shuffled a bit towards off and this time he swept it much finer for four
1.3,"Narine to de Kock, FOUR runs","sweeps it well this time from well outside off, he had to reach for it a fair bit and slapped it away. Uthappa ran across to his left, put in a dive, got a hand and slid the ball in but it went for four"
1.2,"Narine to de Kock, no run",outside the leg stump now and he tries to sweep but misses
1.1,"Narine to de Kock, no run","length delivery towards the off side, de Kock defends it carefully off the back foot"
0.6,"Chawla to McCullum, no run",presses forward and blocks the length delivery into the covers. What a start from Chawla
0.5,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","quicker, flatter and closer to off, defends off the back foot this time"
0.4,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","length delivery well outside off, he leans forward and pushes it to point"
0.3,"Chawla to de Kock, 1 run","tossed up on the leg stump, de Kock drives it down to mid off"
0.2,"Chawla to de Kock, no run","bit more flight and bit fuller, de Kock tucks it to leg"
0.1,"Chawla to de Kock, no run","right on the stumps, the first ball, and the goes on the back foot to defend it"
19.6,"Basil to Archer, 1 run",all over. A fuller one that curves in and Archer whips it away off the pads to deep midwicket
19.5,"Basil to Gowtham, OUT",gone. Gowtham has picked out long-off and that's the game. Fails to get hold of this fullish ball. Doesn't help that it's curving into him and he doesn't get the room he's looking for as a result. Chips it straight into the hands of long-off
19.4,"Basil to Gowtham, 2 runs","low dipping full toss on middle, Gowtham shovels it straight back and long-on ad long-off converge. The latter slides across and stretches full tilt to pull it back"
19.3,"Basil to Rahane, 1 run","low full toss outside off, Rahane mistimes his punch straight back at the bowler who gets a hand to it"
19.2,"Basil to Gowtham, 1 run","extremely full outside off again, and Gowtham can only squeeze it out to extra cover. They take the single"
19.1,"Basil to Gowtham, FOUR runs","good delivery but an equally good shot from Gowtham. A full one, tailing in late into Gowtham. Nearly a yorker but not quite. Gowtham manages to get underneath it and whips it off the toes through square leg"
18.6,"Kaul to Rahane, no run","slower length ball, keeps a little low outside off and Rahane pulls and the ball sneaks from underneath the bat"
18.5,"Kaul to Rahane, 2 runs",walks across early for a paddle and sees this length ball outside off and slaps it through point instead. Shakib runs to his left and sticks the boot out to stop it before the boundary
18.4,"Kaul to Gowtham, 1 run","just back of a length, Gowtham walks across and whips it through backward square leg"
18.3,"Kaul to Lomror, OUT","brilliant catch by Saha! Another wide fuller one, slanted a long way across the left-hander Lomror and he throws his hands at it without moving his feet. Gets a thick outside edge and Saha flings himself to his left to take a superb, leaping catch"
18.2,"Kaul to Lomror, 2 runs","Manish Pandey with a brilliant effort to save a six. A wide fuller one that Lomror lofts over the in-field. Pandey at long-off snaffles it reverse-cupped, leans back as he does so, and is right in front of the boundary. He's falling over with the momentum and releases the ball as he's falling away. Top effort. Just about lets the ball go as he falls over the boundary line"
18.1,"Kaul to Rahane, 1 run",backs away to a short one and picks backward point as he slaps it. Straight to the fielder but they do well take the run
17.6,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, 1 run","short and turning away, pulled extremely hard to deep midwicket"
17.5,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, no run",gets down for a reverse sweep but it's a full one outside off and he can't make contact as the ball sneaks from underneath
17.4,"Rashid Khan to Lomror, 1 run",advances down the ground and whips a full toss to deep square leg
17.3,"Rashid Khan to Lomror, no run",backs away and tries to cut a shortish one and loses shape as it spins away and bounces extra
17.2,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, 1 run","gets down for another sweep, has to fetch it from outside off, so he doesn't time it too well as he works it to deep midwicket"
17.1,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, SIX runs",Rahane finally with the big hit. Whew! That was a long time coming. Rashid nicely floats this up outside Rahane's off-stump and he gets down on a knee to slog it over square leg for a massive six
16.6,"Kaul to Rahane, 1 run","length ball that cuts in from outside off, shuffles across and flicks to midwicket"
16.5,"Kaul to Lomror, 1 run","full, angled across at a fifth-stump channel, drilled down to long-on"

15.2,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, no run","does him in with drift and flight that draws him forward, and turn as it spins away and beats him with the backfoot coming off. Slides it back in"

14.6,"Sandeep to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length outside off, shuffles across and flicks to midwicket"
14.5,"Sandeep to Rahane, 2 runs","slower length ball, a legcutter, picked early by Rahane who times a flick and places it wide of the deep midwicket fielder"
14.4,"Sandeep to Lomror, 1 run","slower full ball, pushed out to sweeper cover"
14.3,"Sandeep to Lomror, no run",
14.2,"Sandeep to Lomror, 2 runs","is that a run out chance? Nah, the dive has saved him there. Lomror advances down the ground to a shortish delivery and slashes it away to sweeper cover. They take on the fielder for a second and the dive ended up being timely"
14.1,"Sandeep to Lomror, no run","shortish around off, tries to flick and the ball goes off the outside of the bat down the pitch"
13.6,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, OUT",off the outside part of the bat. A legbreak that turns minimally and Buttler slices it in the air as he fails to get entirely underneath the stroke. Simple catch for Dhawan at long-off. Sunrisers right back into this

10.2,"Pathan to Stokes, OUT","  and Sunrisers' sixth bowler knocks out Stokes' leg stump. Flat dart, fizzes in from around the wicket, not as short as Stokes anticipated. He swings his hands at a pull and only collects fresh air. Yusuf roars. No Nabi? no problem. It wasn't a great ball but Yusuf will take this wicket"
10.1,"Pathan to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length on off, stands tall and forces a single down to long-on"
9.6,"Kaul to Stokes, no run","shortish, backs away and slaps it to cover. Rahane sets off for a single and has to be sent back"
9.5,"Kaul to Stokes, no run",shuffles across and blocks a length ball
9.4,"Kaul to Samson, OUT","straight to midwicket. These are the kind of wickets you don't want to be giving away against an attack like the Sunrisers.

5.4,"Kaul to Samson, 2 runs","back of a length, just punches from the crease and picks the gap nicely at cover"
5.3,"Kaul to Samson, FOUR runs",that's some pretty amazing work again through the leg side. Shortish from the bowler and there's not much pace. Samson gets in position and rocks a pull through midwicket. Great timing
5.2,"Kaul to Rahane, 1 run","short of a length, whipped away from outside off towards midwicket"

3.5,"Basil to Samson, 2 runs","is that four again? No, no quite. This time the fielder gets around it. An attempted yorker gone wrong, it's a low full toss that's been whipped between midwicket and long-on, and the latter gets around it"
3.4,"Basil to Samson, FOUR runs","there's a deep midwicket but no way he was going to get there in time. Another short delivery, and a powerful pull from Samson through square leg"

3.2,"Basil to Samson, SIX runs",short and angled into him at pace. What more does a batsman need? Samson swivels and flays a pull over deep midwicket

2.1,"Sandeep to Tripathi, no run","short and wide, slapped away to point"
1.6,"Shakib to Rahane, FOUR runs","oh, shot. That's pristine timing and placement. Shifts back and whips this back of a length delivery against the turn through midwicket. Top stuff"

0.1,"Sandeep to Rahane, no run",sharply cuts in from a back of a length outside off and he punches it away to point

19.5,"Archer to Rashid Khan, OUT","opens up the leg side and pulls this short ball from outside off, but can only hit it as far as Stokes at deep midwicket. No timing whatsoever on that."

18.6,"Unadkat to Rashid Khan, no run","big across-the-line mow, beaten. Played too early."
18.5,"Unadkat to Pandey, OUT","another painstaking Pandey innings comes to an end. Was in no control of this lofted hit. Sliced this slower delivery to point, where Rahane moved a couple of steps back to complete the catch. Royals continue to surge."
18.4,"Unadkat to Saha, 1 run","looks to scoop but Unadkat bowls this full and wide outside off, squeezed wide of point"
18.3,"Unadkat to Saha, 2 runs","slower and fuller on off, eased down to long of. There's a misfield from a limping Gowtham, who gives away the extra run. Cramps or something more? He's limping Seems fine."
18.2,"Unadkat to Saha, 2 runs","slower and fuller outside off, eased down to third man to get off the mark. There's an overthrow as well from Archer, so they get the extra run"
18.1,"Unadkat to Pandey, 1 run",flat-bats a pull down to long on
17.6,"Archer to Pathan, OUT","slashes this straight down the throat of third man. Yusuf looked to upper cut, this one didn't bounce as much as he would've liked. Easy catch, Archer continues to impress with every outing."
17.5,"Archer to Pandey, 1 run","right into the blockhole again, squeezed to point"
17.4,"Archer to Pathan, 1 run",whips this full delivery to deep midwicket. Bowled at 141.9kph
17.3,"Archer to Pandey, 1 run","short on middle, pulled all along the ground to deep midwicket where two fielders converge. Pandey wanted the second, Yusuf wasn't ken"
17.2,"Archer to Pathan, 1 run",bunts this length ball to point as they scamper a single.
17.1,"Archer to Shakib, OUT","the inswinging yorker has done the trick. Gets this to bend back in a long way from outside off from around the stumps, Shakib jams his bat down late as the ball bounces into the stumps. 'Should I, should I not?' the ball thought to itself before disturbing the bails"
16.6,"Stokes to Pandey, no run","slash and a miss. Tried to smack the cover off the ball, beaten. Into the stroke too early."
16.5,"Stokes to Pandey, no run","slower length ball outside off, he backs away and punches this to cover."
16.4,"Stokes to Pandey, FOUR runs","clears his front leg, gets down on one knee and lofts this over extra cover. Mid-off was inside the ring so it was a safe stroke."
16.3,"Stokes to Pandey, 2 runs","touch short, he rocks back and cuts this into the gap at sweeper cover"
16.2,"Stokes to Shakib, 1 run","length ball, stops on him a touch as he looks to slap this cover, but hits it straight to the fielder and hustles a single"

14.6,"Sodhi to Shakib, FOUR runs",uses the pace to paddle this to the fine leg boundary. Nicely done by Shakib.
14.5,"Sodhi to Williamson, OUT","shapes to cut but this one spins back in the other way, keeps low and kisses the inside half of the bat as Buttler pouches a superb catch.  Staying low was the key. Williamson asked if this was an appeal for lbw or caught behind. Umpire Nanda Kishore signalled that it was for caught behind and he's made the right decision.  Sodhi gets his New Zealand captain. . First wicket in the IPL for him."
14.4,"Sodhi to Pandey, 1 run","another half-tracker outside off, pulled towards deep midwicket."
14.3,"Sodhi to Williamson, 1 run","half-tracker down leg, saved by Unadkat's fielding effort at deep square. Williamson cleared his front leg and absolutely walloped this pull. Should've been four, it's one instead."
14.2,"Sodhi to Pandey, 1 run","slow turn from length on off stump, dabbed towards point"
14.1,"Sodhi to Pandey, no run",looks to go over the bowler's head but toe ends this back
13.6,"Gowtham to Williamson, 2 runs","works this from outside off towards wide long on. Archer had some work to do, excellent running."

13.4,"Gowtham to Williamson, no run",squeezes out this full deli very back to the bowler.
13.3,"Gowtham to Hales, OUT","slices this to point. Gowtham has beaten him in flight. Hales backed away to go inside-out but Gowtham slowed this down nicely to have him reach out, Hales didn't get much bat on it. Easily taken by Samson at point."
13.2,"Gowtham to Williamson, 1 run","backs away to go over cover, but is made to reach out for this as Gowtham fires this wide, hit down to long off"

12.6,"Archer to Williamson, no run","pacy bouncer on middle, Williamson ducks under it"
12.5,"Archer to Williamson, no run","yorker length outside off, Williamson beaten for pace as he looks to squeeze this behind square"
12.4,"Archer to Williamson, SIX runs","he's in complete control. Touch full, Williamson swings through the line to clear long off with ease. Not by any means a half-volley, but the balance and poise all in sync as he put that away"
12.3,"Archer to Williamson, no run","looks to mow this across the line but swung through early and missed. Rolls to the keeper. Brushed the flap of the pad, I think."
12.2,"Archer to Hales, 1 run",dabs this gently into the off side for a quick single.
12.1,"Archer to Williamson, 1 run","angles in a length ball from wide of the crease, worked to midwicket"
11.6,"Unadkat to Williamson, 1 run",works this slower length ball from outside off towards deep midwicket.  Excellent half-century 
11.5,"Unadkat to Williamson, FOUR runs","looks to swing over long off, gets a thick outside edge that flies to the third man boundary. Streaky but it doesn't matter"
11.4,"Unadkat to Williamson, 2 runs",works this length ball on middle and leg towards the man coming in from deep midwicket
11.3,"Unadkat to Williamson, FOUR runs","change of angle, no problem. Slaps this length ball over extra cover, raced to the boundary in a jiffy."
11.2,"Unadkat to Williamson, SIX runs","steps out, opens up the off side and lofts through the line to clear long off. As stylish as it gets. Superb balance"
11.1,"Unadkat to Williamson, FOUR runs","paddled wide of the keeper. Slower length ball on middle, he got outside the line and helped it along the way."
10.6,"Lomror to Hales, FOUR runs","pulled, on the bounce to deep midwicket. Too short, asking to be hit and Hales did the rest."
10.5,"Lomror to Hales, no run","drifting down leg, paddled fine but straight to short fine leg"
10.4,"Lomror to Williamson, 1 run","backs away to go over cover but is cramped for room, bunts this back down the pitch"

9.2,"Stokes to Hales, 2 runs",whips this down to fine leg where Sodhi dishes out a sliding stop to save a couple of runs
9.1,"Stokes to Hales, FOUR runs","hammers the pull, splits the gap at deep square. Good control, got on top of the bounce and rolled his wrists nicely."
8.6,"Sodhi to Williamson, FOUR runs",this is too full and it has been smoked away into the gap between deep cover and long off. Got right to the pitch to belt that away.
8.5,"Sodhi to Hales, 1 run",eased to point when Tripathi dives to his right to stop that
8.4,"Sodhi to Hales, no run","beaten by the dip and turn, slices the drive on the bounce to point"
8.3,"Sodhi to Hales, 2 runs", just short of Archer at long on.  Mishit again as Hales looks to step out and hit against the turn over long on. Didn't get to the pitch but went through. Archer made the mistake of running around initially when he could've come in straightaway
8.2,"Sodhi to Williamson, 1 run",works this shortish delivery towards midwicket
8.1,"Sodhi to Hales, 1 run","outstanding effort by Stokes to run in from deep midwicket, but takes this on the half-volley. The crowd went up to applaud, but Stokes immediately said no. The ball bobbled out as soon as his elbows hit the ground. This was full and flat on middle, Hales at the risk of being lbw hit that flat and hard. Full marks for the effort"
7.6,"Stokes to Hales, 1 run","slower delivery down leg, eased to fine leg."
7.5,"Stokes to Williamson, 1 run",excellent wrist work to flick this from outside off but Tripathi throws himself to his right to effect a one-handed stop. Saved a couple of runs.

7.3,"Stokes to Hales, 1 run",driven hard to sweeper cover
7.2,"Stokes to Hales, 2 runs","drilled back past the bowler, no chance for mid off. K Gowtham hared around the ropes from long on to put out a diving stop. Super stuff. Saved three runs. I just think both batsmen assumed that will be a boundary."
7.1,"Stokes to Williamson, 1 run","angles in a short ball, pulled down to fine leg"
6.6,"Sodhi to Williamson, 1 run","driven hard, a half-stop at cover keeps it down to a single."
6.5,"Sodhi to Williamson, FOUR runs","rocks back and pulls. This was begging to be hit and Williamson said 'no fret, mate. I'll put that where it should be put.' No one at deep midwicket to protect that"
6.4,"Sodhi to Hales, 1 run","spins away but keeps a touch low, punched down to long on."
6.3,"Sodhi to Williamson, 1 run","plenty of revs on this one, driven with the spin to deep cover as they jog the single"
6.2,"Sodhi to Hales, 1 run",eased with the spin to long off

4.4,"Archer to Williamson, 1 run",gets on top of the bounce and turns this square on the leg side
4.3,"Archer to Williamson, no run"," Tripathi drops a straightforward offering at slip!  He squared him up with a length ball that climbed on him, nipped away a touch to take the edge as well, Tripathi juggled on the second attempt and muffed it in the end. Oh, dear. How costly will that be? Archer is annoyed."
4.2,"Archer to Williamson, FOUR runs","lovely straight drive this. Not much of a flourish, all hands and the timing is delightful as he beats mid on."
4.1,"Archer to Hales, 1 run","hurries Hales for pace as he gets a thick inside edge on the drive to mid on, quick single scampered"
3.6,"Kulkarni to Williamson, no run","leans into the drive, eases this straight to extra cover"

3.3,"Kulkarni to Williamson, 1 run","gets this to bounce from length on off stump, dabbed behind the stumps as they scamper through"
3.2,"Kulkarni to Williamson, no run","shapes away late. This is much fuller and starts off from middle, KW is squared up a touch as he defends."

2.6,"Gowtham to Williamson, 1 run","slow turn back in from off stump, punched to long on."

2.2,"Gowtham to Williamson, 1 run",works this with the spin to deep midwicket
2.1,"Gowtham to S Dhawan, OUT","chopped on! Shortened his length, got this to drift in from around the stumps, Dhawan looks to steer this past slip after first looking to sweep, but didn't have the room and ends up hitting it onto his stumps off an inside edge. His third failure in a row now."
1.6,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, 1 run","straying onto the pads, tucked away wide of short fine leg."
1.5,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","full on middle and leg, Dhawan is off balance as he squeezes the flick but somehow has managed to hit it well. Trickles into the short square leg boundary."
1.4,"Kulkarni to Hales, 1 run","much better. Touch ahead of length on off, driven on the up to mid off"
1.3,"Kulkarni to Hales, FOUR runs","pulled handsomely in front of square, into the gap between midwicket and mid-on. Too short from Kulkarni, can't bowl there at 125kph. Hales picked the length very early."
1.2,"Kulkarni to Hales, no run","length on off stump, defended back with soft hands"
1.1,"Kulkarni to Hales, FOUR runs",width and Hales has flayed that behind point. Cracking stroke! Opened his wrists up nicely to pick the gap.
0.6,"Gowtham to Hales, 1 run","short and flat on middle and leg, punched to midwicket"

19.4,"Tahir to Pandya, 1 run", second win of the season for Mumbai Indians!  They're still alive in the competition. The scorecard may suggest a last-over win but this has been a very comprehensive one. Uses the pace to steer this past short third man. Too easy.  Just the second loss for CSK 
19.3,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","through with the pull too early, toe-ends his past midwicket.  Scores level "
19.2,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","steps out and works this with the angle towards deep midwicket. Thakur caught napping, they're back for the second easily."
19.1,"Tahir to Pandya, 1 run",punches this length delivery to long on
18.6,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","swept from outside off, picks the gap at deep square leg.  Half-century for the captain and what a time to do so.  Brave. Shardul went full, Rohit could've used the pace to go behind point but preferred the leg side because he was well aware"
18.5,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run",beaten for pace. Rohit stayed back to steer this behind point
18.4,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","slower length ball, Rohit holds his shape and plays the dab really late to bisect backward point and short third man."

18.2,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","sliced over point. Too full, too wide. Rohit sliced this full toss over Harbhajan. No chance for third man. That should ease some pressure in the Mumbai dug out"
18.1,"Thakur to Pandya, 1 run","yorker length just outside off, squeezed to deep cover. Good ball first up."
17.6,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","sees the batsman stepping out and bowls this full and wide, Rohit reaches out to squeeze this to deep cover where M Vijay cuts this off."
17.5,"Watson to Pandya, 1 run","into the blockhole, squeezes this to deep midwicket"
17.4,"Watson to Pandya, SIX runs","holds his shape, swings through the line and clears long on effortlessly. Beautiful swing of the bat, poor from Watson. Can't bowl length."
17.3,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",works this from length outside off to wide long on
17.2,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","length ball outside off, Rohit lofts through the line. Tahir can't bend low to cut that off at sweeper cover. Poor effort."
17.2,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","fires this full and just outside the wide line. Rohit left this, quite a brave call."
17.1,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, no run","width outside off, flayed on the up but can't beat mid off."
16.6,"Bravo to Pandya, no run",looks to turn this slower delivery to long on but this one gripped the surface and bounced more to hit the top part of the bat. Defended back. Top over from Bravo

16.2,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",gloves this pull down to fine leg
16.1,"Bravo to Lewis, OUT","is that an opening? Surely has to be. The first ball after the break has fetched a wicket. Slower length ball angling away, Lewis slogs across the line, only to slice this to Shardul, who judges this to perfection at long off."
15.6,"Thakur to Lewis, 1 run","saved by the lack of timing! Looked to pull this off-cutter but the bat face turned in his hand, on the bounce to long on."
15.5,"Thakur to Lewis, no run","drills this to mid-off, Rohit wanted the single but was sent back"
15.4,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","flicked up and over, down to deep midwicket"

14.2,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, no run",defended back but Bravo moves quickly to his left and fires the throw back at the striker's end. Rohit reacted quickly to get back
14.1,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","short, he lines himself up to pull, executes it with precision. Into the deep backward square leg boundary"
14.1,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide",slower length ball but errs in direction. Way down leg.
13.6,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","mistimes a drive to long off. Three dots and a single, yet 13 came off that over. Mumbai well on track"
13.5,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, no run","back to bowling length on off, punched to the diving Raina at cover"
13.4,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","uses the pace to sweep him for six. Got outside the line of the stumps, picked this full delivery and cleared short fine leg effortlessly. I think he also surprised himself with how well he hit it. Thing of beauty"
13.3,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, no run","this one hits one spot and takes off from length outside off, Rohit jabs this to point. The bottom hand came off the grip as he played that."
13.2,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, no run",crunching drive but a super stop by Raina at cover. May have saved at least two runs
13.1,"Watson to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","one-handed six, would you believe it? Went downtown to a length ball but in doing so, the bottom hand came off the grip. Chance for long off? No chance in hell. He was a mere spectator. The bats these days, I tell you"
12.6,"Bravo to Lewis, FOUR runs","full toss that has been belted to beat cover and wide long-off. Easy pickings. Was a good over until then, but now the pressure has been released."
12.5,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye","overbalanced as he looks to flick, the ball snakes back in to deflect off the pad to the leg side. Leg bye it is"
12.4,"Bravo to Lewis, 1 run","floated full on middle, tails away just a touch, driven to long off"

10.5,"Tahir to Lewis, SIX runs","for most parts, this was a mistimed pull, but well, it still cleared long on by a distance. I was looking mid on, but it just kept going, going .."

10.3,"Tahir to Lewis, 1 run","shortish delivery, pulled to Jadeja on the bounce at deep midwicket"
10.3,"Tahir to Lewis, 1 wide",fires this across the left-hander but just outside the wide line
10.2,"Tahir to Lewis, SIX runs","walks across the stumps and lofts this to clear deep cover. This was a googly, he lined himself up perfectly and hit that super clean"
10.1,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","quick googly, Rohit picks this from length and turns this to the leg side to get off the mark"
9.6,"Harbhajan to Lewis, 2 runs","works this indrifter on the pad towards deep square. Billings took a while to run in, by which time they'd scampered the second."
9.5,"Harbhajan to Yadav, OUT","Jadeja's brilliance has made this catch possible at deep midwicket. Surya picked the length early, rocked back and pulled this ferociously. Jadeja covered plenty of ground to his left and then put in the slide to complete the catch even as the ball was dying on him."
9.4,"Harbhajan to Lewis, 1 run","slider that drifts back in to keep a touch low, Lewis eases this down to deep point"

9.1,"Harbhajan to Yadav, 1 run","flatter length ball on middle, punched to long on"
8.6,"Tahir to Lewis, FOUR runs",juicy full toss and Lewis belts this back over Tahir's head. A good over has just been spoilt by that hit-me delivery. They'll take the time-out as well with that.
8.5,"Tahir to Lewis, 4 byes","rare miss from Dhoni. Once again beaten in flight, deceived by the googly as he looked to swing. Dhoni switched off for a split-second, beats short third man to the boundary."
8.4,"Tahir to Lewis, no run","fires this full on off, squeezes the drive to cover"
8.3,"Tahir to Lewis, no run", slog and a miss.  Deceived in flight as he looked to swing across the line to long on.

8.1,"Tahir to Yadav, 1 run","fired full on the stumps from wide of the crease, eased to long on"
7.6,"Harbhajan to Lewis, no run",punched off the backfoot back to the bowler. Top over from Harbhajan; just two off it
7.5,"Harbhajan to Lewis, no run","and again. Fuller this time, and Lewis drives but Raina tumbles to his left again to stop it"
7.4,"Harbhajan to Lewis, no run",brilliant stop by Raina at mid-off as Lewis slaps this off the backfoot and Raina dives to his left to intercept it

5.4,"Thakur to Yadav, SIX runs","leg-side fuller ball, and he gets maximum reward for it. Just times a flick off his pads and heaves it right over backward square leg. Top timing"
5.3,"Thakur to Lewis, 1 run",flicks a length ball through square leg
5.2,"Thakur to Yadav, 1 run",run out chance but he's made it> Drills a fuller one from outside off towards mid-on and sets off straight away. Could a direct hit have had him in some trouble?

4.6,"Harbhajan to Yadav, 1 run","length, spinning in, waits for it before punching it down to long-on"

4.4,"Harbhajan to Yadav, no run","short of a length, stands tall and punches to cover"
4.3,"Harbhajan to Lewis, 1 run","shortish, Lewis swivels and pulls it away through square leg. Rayudu sprints to his left from deep midwicket and sticks the left hand out to make a one-handed stop in front of the boundary"

3.4,"Watson to Yadav, no run","short of a length on off, stands tall and punches towards mid-on"
3.3,"Watson to Yadav, 2 runs",opens the face pretty late again as he works it away through point
3.2,"Watson to Yadav, FOUR runs",not much room to work with there but Yadav makes up for it by shifting back and subtly opening the face of his bat to knock it through backward of point
3.1,"Watson to Yadav, no run",gets slightly squared up by this back of a length delivery and ends up dropping it just in front of the bowler
2.6,"Chahar to Lewis, 2 runs","fullish around leg, turns it away behind square leg for a quick brace"
2.5,"Chahar to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length, angled in towards middle, flicked away to deep backward square leg"
2.4,"Chahar to Yadav, FOUR runs","this is not the ideal length to be bowling at all. Too short, and so much width on offer. Yadav waits and then jumps before slashing a late uppercut through third man"
2.3,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","short ball, Yadav mistimes his pull and swings early to get hit around the rib cage area on his right side"
2.2,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","that's much tighter. A short of a length delivery around off, Suryakumar jabs it back to the bowler from the crease"
2.1,"Chahar to Yadav, FOUR runs",another leg-sidish delivery. CSK can ill-afford this. Angled into his pads and Suryakumar gets on his toes before tucking it off the pads behind square
1.6,"Thakur to Lewis, FOUR runs","ah, throws water on a good, tight over with this legside back of a length delivery that Lewis swivels and helps along to the fine leg boundary"
1.5,"Thakur to Lewis, no run",flashes hard at the sight of width but it's pacy and he isn't entirely behind the line as the ball shoots past the outside edge
1.4,"Thakur to Lewis, no run","short of good length, angled across around the fifth-stump line, Lewis stands tall and punches to point who moves to his right and stops it"
1.3,"Thakur to Lewis, no run",left alone outside off
1.2,"Thakur to Lewis, 2 runs","fullish length, flicked off the pads through midwicket"
1.1,"Thakur to Lewis, no run","much better. A length ball that's angled across and straightens around the fourth or fifth-stump channel, left alone"
1.1,"Thakur to Lewis, 1 wide","short of a length, down the leg side as it gets past Lewis' attempted flick. CSK can't afford loose deliveries like this"
0.6,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","short ball, can't negotiate the bounce well as he fails to connect with a pull and wears it on the upper body instead"
0.6,"Chahar to Yadav, 1 wide","length ball, sprayed down the leg side"
0.5,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","short of a length, shuffles across and punches firmly to cover where Billings moves to his left and makes a tumbling stop"

0.1,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","short of a length around off, shuffles across and blocks"
19.6,"Pandya to Raina, SIX runs","right into Raina's swinging arc and he's walloped this over deep midwicket. Saw Raina backing away, and tried to cramp him but ended up straying on the pads. Raina didn't miss out."
19.5,"Pandya to Raina, 2 runs",just about eludes Cutting at wide long off. Saw the ball dying on him but went for the catch even at the risk of this bouncing and hitting his face.
19.4,"Pandya to Billings, OUT",steps out and heaves this straight down Cutting's throat at long-on. Hardik's slower deliveries are yielding returns for Mumbai at the death.
19.3,"Pandya to Raina, 1 run",whips this full toss from outside off towards deep midwicket
19.2,"Pandya to Billings, 1 run","backs away, so Hardik goes full and wide, Billings toe-ends this swing across the line to long on"
19.1,"Pandya to Raina, 1 run","full on middle, whipped to deep midwicket"
18.6,"Bumrah to Billings, no run","beaten! Swung through early to mow over deep midwicket, didn't account for the change in pace. Well-executed slower one"
18.5,"Bumrah to Raina, 1 run",once again cramped for room as he jabs this towards midwicket. Got it on the top part of the bat
18.4,"Bumrah to Billings, 1 run","pulled, one bounce to deep square leg"
18.3,"Bumrah to Raina, 1 run","lofted through the line, one bounce to sweeper cover"
18.2,"Bumrah to Raina, SIX runs","wallops this length ball to clear deep midwicket.  Bumrah shortened his length so Raina didn't get underneath it, but didn't matter. Not much of a backswing but he still managed to generate enough power to clear the ropes."
18.1,"Bumrah to Raina, 2 runs","not on control of this lofted hit down to long-off but he'll hare back for the second. Slower delivery from Bumrah, Raina looked to thump down the ground but didn't have the pace he would've liked."
17.6,"McClenaghan to Raina, 1 run","backs away to go over the off side, McClenaghan angles it in to cramp him. Raina goes through and just manages to hit it past cover point"
17.5,"McClenaghan to Billings, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, steered straight to point but he's off the mark"
17.4,"McClenaghan to Raina, 1 run","cramped for room, plays the short-arm jab to deep midwicket"
17.3,"McClenaghan to Bravo, OUT","no room to swing, so he ends up slicing this pull to Markande at point. This is very good from McClenaghan, hit the deck hard to extract bounce. The effort ball has done the trick. Well held by the 20-year old. Mumbai are roaring back at the death."
17.2,"McClenaghan to Raina, 1 run",works this half-pull from outside off to deep backward square leg
17.1,"McClenaghan to Dhoni, OUT","full toss outside off, Dhoni reaches out to hit this well but picks out deep cover where Evin Lewis takes a dolly. Was McClenaghan looking to bowl a wide yorker? Doesn't matter, he's got the wicket somehow."
16.6,"Bumrah to Dhoni, 1 leg bye",snakes back in from length to thud into his thigh pad and deflect to short third man
16.5,"Bumrah to Raina, 1 run","shapes to whip over midwicket, gets a thick inside edge to fine leg"
16.4,"Bumrah to Raina, FOUR runs","flicks this full toss, fine leg need not bother getting around because he'll never get there.  Half-century for Raina "
16.3,"Bumrah to Raina, no run","backs away to go over cover, beaten by an offcutter that keeps low, just misses the stumps"
16.2,"Bumrah to Raina, FOUR runs","too short, Raina gets across and pulls to clear short fine leg. Poor from Bumrah, his death bowling this IPL has been far from ideal."
16.1,"Bumrah to Dhoni, 1 run","pulled into the gap, Duminy runs around from deep midwicket to cut that off."
16.1,"Bumrah to Dhoni, 1 wide","full toss angling down, Dhoni swings and misses. His protege Kishan does well to dive to his left and stop."
15.6,"Markande to Dhoni, 1 run",makes room and punch this wide of point for a quick single
15.5,"Markande to Raina, 1 leg bye","looks to sweep, ball rolls off his pad to short fine as they scamper a single"
15.4,"Markande to Dhoni, 1 run",backs away and slaps this length ball to deep cover
15.3,"Markande to Dhoni, SIX runs","the bottom-handed drill is sent soaring into the stands at long-on. Too full from Markande, just a little skip down the pitch from Dhoni as he tees off in style. So close he got to the pitch that he negated the turn superbly."
15.3,"Markande to Dhoni, 1 wide","beaten by the googly, but is safe!  Steps out to swing, misses but has the presence of mind to quickly plonk his bat back in.  Only Dhoni could've stumped Dhoni there "
15.2,"Markande to Dhoni, FOUR runs","sees Dhoni stepping out and fires this wide. No problem, Dhoni does well to reach out and then slam this inside-out over cover. Foxed him but he still had enough to use his reach to pick this."
15.1,"Markande to Dhoni, no run","drifts in and spins away from middle, turned to the leg side"
14.6,"Pandya to Dhoni, 1 run","slapped to point, where there's a misfield by Suryakumar. Dhoni pinches a single to keep strike"
14.5,"Pandya to Dhoni, FOUR runs","pulled! Almost like he knew what was coming. Hardik drops short, Dhoni stands his ground and pulls handsomely in front of square, one bounce into the ropes."
14.4,"Pandya to Dhoni, FOUR runs","drills this, one bounce to long-off. Saw this in his swinging arc, brought out his powerful bottom-handed whip to belt this. Typical Dhoni shot"
14.3,"Pandya to Raina, 1 run",squeezes this leg-stump yorker to fine leg
14.2,"Pandya to Raina, no run",looks to hop across and whip it square but is cramped for room as this hits him near the box
14.1,"Pandya to Dhoni, 1 run",thumps this short of length delivery to sweeper cover. Good work by Mitch
13.6,"Krunal to Dhoni, 1 run","was looking to heave but Krunal drifted this in short on middle and leg, turned behind square"
13.5,"Krunal to Raina, 1 run",squeezes this low full toss wide of Rohit at cover

11.5,"Krunal to Dhoni, 1 run","too full outside off, Dhoni carves it away to deep point"
11.4,"Krunal to Dhoni, no run",no feet from the CSK captain as he stays in the crease and defends this length ball
11.3,"Krunal to Dhoni, no run","fullish length, curves in towards off, Dhoni pushes it out off the front foot"
11.2,"Krunal to Rayudu, OUT","has he picked the fielder there? Yes, he has. Comes slightly forward and then slogs this Pandya delivery but it sails right into the waiting hands of deep midwicket as he doesn't find the power he's looking for. Cutting didn't have to move an inch. Surely, that counts as a failure for Rayudu going by his ridiculous form this season?"
11.1,"Krunal to Rayudu, no run","too full and a bit of width as he floats it up outside off, Rayudu jams the bat down and hits the turf"
10.6,"McClenaghan to Raina, no run","shortish, curving into him, tries to tuck it off the hips and misses. But he just about missed making contact there, and the delivery's well within to be legal"
10.5,"McClenaghan to Raina, no run","short, lets it go outside off as it holds its line"
10.4,"McClenaghan to Rayudu, 1 run","full, angled across around off, makes sure to give himself enough room and drives to long-off"

9.6,"Markande to Raina, 1 run",works it away into the leg side for one
9.5,"Markande to Raina, SIX runs","that's even better. Steps down the track and mows this over long-on. A typical Raina strike, just giving the impression that it may not be clean, and then sailing well over"
9.4,"Markande to Raina, FOUR runs","flat and powerful. Pitched right up to Raina with the gift of room, and he shovels it straight over the bowler's head after freeing his arms"
9.3,"Markande to Rayudu, 1 run","slides in with the arm from a length, punched down to long-on"

8.1,"Cutting to Rayudu, SIX runs","full on middle, slower ball at 114.4 ks, but Rayudu picks it and holds his shape as he carts it over long-on. This man is in some form"

5.6,"Pandya to Rayudu, SIX runs","makes room, steps out and swings through to hit this length ball over long off. He's in some nick is this Rayudu."
5.5,"Pandya to Rayudu, FOUR runs","thick outside edge and just outside the reach of Ishan Kishan. Short third man was a mere spectator. This knuckleball bounced much more than Rayudu anticipated as he shaped to cut, the end result: streaky four"

3.6,"Pandya to Rayudu, no run","gets a thick outside edge, straight to Krunal at short third man."
3.5,"Pandya to Rayudu, no run",proper cross-batted heave! Opens up the leg side to pull but was beaten by the slower delivery that angled in to hit him on the right thigh.

17.6,"Avesh Khan to Johnson, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, but Johnson backed away a lot. Slaps it past Pant's left to third man"

15.3,"Mishra to Russell, OUT","flighted outside off, and it's cut straight to Iyer at point. Gill wants the run, and he's at the danger end. Pant's quick to whip the bails off and Gill's dive is just not good enough. A well-constructed innings comes to a halt. Time out"
15.2,"Mishra to Russell, no run","quicker ball! Full just outside off, but zips straight through. Defended down the wrong line, and lucky that doesn't find the outside edge. Pant removes the bails and the umpire wants to go to the TV umpire. Nope, Russell's safe. His back foot came down in time"

12.4,"Boult to Russell, 1 run","slower ball, on a good length. Cut off the back foot to point, but there's no single on offer. Point takes a throw at the stumps anyway, and misses, which allows them to complete the run at the end. Tewatia the guilty man"
12.3,"Boult to Russell, FOUR runs","deft! Short on off, and Russell tiptoes before guiding it over point's head. Sticks his bat out and Boult's pace does the rest"
12.2,"Boult to Russell, SIX runs","in Russell's arc! Full on middle stump, and gets his front foot out of the way before muscling this over Boult. Lands over the sightscreen. Just misses the press box"

11.5,"Avesh Khan to Russell, SIX runs","second tier! Short on off, and that's a very powerful pull. Swats it away towards the leg side, and what speed off the bat. A full 90 metres, this maximum"
11.4,"Avesh Khan to Russell, no run",back of a length on middle and following Russell. He does well to get under the ball and duck out of its way
11.3,"Avesh Khan to Gill, 1 run","good length just outside off. Makes some room, and mistimes a cut past point to deep backward point. Gets Russell back on strike"
11.2,"Avesh Khan to Russell, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, and Russell makes room before thumping this down the ground. Long on does well to slide across the ground and intercept"
11.1,"Avesh Khan to Russell, no run","short on off, and Russell's wild leg-side slog doesn't come off. The pull is played through early and the ball sneaks under his bat"
10.6,"Plunkett to Gill, no run","full and slanting in towards off stump, Gill eyes up the leg side. Instead, he squirts a leading edge to the left of the bowler"
10.5,"Plunkett to Russell, 1 run","really full on middle and leg, worked away to deep midwicket. A double is just too much for that dodgy hamstring"

10.3,"Plunkett to Russell, FOUR runs","hip-high short ball outside off, back-of-the-hand slower ball, Russell waits for it to arrive and swats it away to the wide long-on boundary. Fetch that"

9.6,"Mishra to Gill, 1 run","wide legbreak, chopped wide of point"
9.5,"Mishra to Gill, FOUR runs","short, flat, quick, but does not bounce as much as the batsman expected it to. Gill shapes for the pull but adjusts superbly to the lack of bounce. He shovels it with the bottom hand and summons enough power. What was more remarkable was that he found the gap between deep midwicket and wide long-on"
9.4,"Mishra to Russell, 1 run","flat and quick, slides into the pads, tucked away to deep square leg"
9.3,"Mishra to Karthik, OUT","Mishra lobs it up outside off and gets it to break away further. He forces Karthik to reach out for the ball. Karthik tries to do so but loses his shape. He aims to go over the covers, but instead carves it squarer to Boult at backward point. Over to you, Russell"
9.2,"Mishra to Karthik, no run","just too full for the sweep, DK. He still goes through with the shot and under-edges it. The ball drops in front of Pant"

8.1,"Shankar to Karthik, no run","back of a length on off, punched on the up but straight to cover"
7.6,"Mishra to Gill, 2 runs","short outside off, and once again spinning away from the batsman. Stretches out, and connects with the cut. In the air for a while, but falls just beyond cover point. Boult does well in the deep to parry it back. Time out"
7.5,"Mishra to Gill, no run","good length outside off, and it's the googly! Forces the batsman to go onto the back foot, and defend it towards the leg side"
7.4,"Mishra to Karthik, 1 run","full outside off, and driven with the legspin to wide long off. In the air for a while, but it was pretty safe"

7.2,"Mishra to Gill, 1 run","drifted into middle stump, and Gill punches it down the ground off the front foot"
7.1,"Mishra to Karthik, 1 run","flat to start off. It's the half-tracker, that DK comfortably flat-bats down the ground to long on"
6.6,"Plunkett to Gill, no run","full on off stump. Very accurate, and Gill gives the delivery the respect it deserves. Defended off the front foot"
6.5,"Plunkett to Karthik, 1 run","fuller on off stump, and Karthik turns it off his pads to the leg side. Hit well, but man at deep midwicket for this shot"
6.4,"Plunkett to Karthik, SIX runs","pulled over backward square! Back of a length on middle, and DK simply uses his wrists to flick-pull over square leg. Lands just beyond the boundary"
6.3,"Plunkett to Gill, 1 run","good length outside off, but angling into Gill. He tiptoes and glances it towards point. Nice, early call for the single"
6.2,"Plunkett to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length outside off, but too slow. DK has all the time to cut it exactly where he wants. Hit to the man in the deep though"
6.1,"Plunkett to Gill, 1 run","full just outside off, and that's a controlled drive past Plunkett's left. The Powerplay's over so there are men in the deep now"
5.6,"Avesh Khan to Gill, 1 run","good length outside off, and this time Gill waits for the slower ball. Sticks his bat out and pokes it down to third man"
5.5,"Avesh Khan to Gill, FOUR runs","lifted over mid off! Oh, delightful. Full on off, and big back lift before drilling it over the infield. Show me the replay!"
5.4,"Avesh Khan to Gill, no run","short outside off, and Gill goes chasing after it. Tries to slash a cut over slip, but misses"

5.1,"Avesh Khan to Rana, OUT","the short ball does the trick again! Almost 142kph this time, and Rana took his eyes off while trying to pull. Mistimes the shot, and it's the easiest of catches for Avesh. Cups his hands and collects his wicket"

4.5,"Plunkett to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and too close to DK's body for the cut. Chooses to chop it down to third man"
4.4,"Plunkett to Rana, 1 run","slower ball, full on leg stump. But Rana keeps his eyes on the ball and smothers it with soft hands towards square leg"
4.3,"Plunkett to Karthik, 1 run","full just outside off, and DK's front-foot drive takes the outside edge. Runs down to third man this time"
4.2,"Plunkett to Karthik, no run","full outside off, and Karthik's more than happy to drive it uppishly. Hit well, but falls just short of point"
4.1,"Plunkett to Karthik, 2 runs","full on middle, and that's been whipped beautifully over midwicket. Chase for deep backward square, who eventually manages to cut it off. Good use of the wrists"
3.6,"Avesh Khan to Rana, FOUR runs","good length on off but it's angling across Rana, and gives him that extra width to free his arms. Brings out the square drive, and times it to perfection. Races across the outfield"
3.5,"Avesh Khan to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length outside off. Angling into Karthik, and he pushes it off the back foot to cover. They jog across for a run"

3.1,"Avesh Khan to Karthik, 1 run","full just outside off, and that's been driven off the front foot. Sliding dive at cover stops it from going for four"
2.6,"Boult to Narine, OUT","extra bounce does the trick! Short on off, and Narine backed away again to flat-bat it over point. Comes off the bat's top half, and Iyer - at cover - calls early for the catch. Slides across the surface to complete it"
2.5,"Boult to Narine, no run","good length outside off, but extra bounce on this occasion. Narine backed away towards the leg side too much, and can't ramp it over the keeper"
2.4,"Boult to Narine, SIX runs","full on leg stump, but Narine drills this over the non-striker! Straight as an arrow. Too full, in fact, and Narine simple bunts this straight"
2.3,"Boult to Narine, SIX runs","over long off! Thumps this over Boult's head. Good length outside off, makes some extra room, and then sends this over the boundary"
2.2,"Boult to Rana, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and Rana waits for this to come at him. Opens his bat's face and taps it to point"
2.1,"Boult to Uthappa, OUT","mistimes his pull! Straight to midwicket. Short on leg stump, and Uthappa was cramped for space. Tried to go through the shot nonetheless, but comes off the bat's top half"
1.6,"Maxwell to Uthappa, 1 run",picked off the pads to deep square leg for one
1.5,"Maxwell to Lynn, OUT","Bowled'em. First ball to Lynn, Maxwell has him chopping on. Narine is strong v spin, but Lynn isn't as strong.

1.4,"Maxwell to Narine, 1 run","back of a length and outside off, backs away and slaps it hard to Iyer. The new captain throws himself to his right to stop the ball"

19.3,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, OUT","101ks slower ball, dips outside off, Iyer does not pick the change-up. He swishes so hard that he loses his shape and under-edges it back to DK behind the stumps. They search for a single but Maxwell is sent back. The keeper passes the ball to Mavi, who clips the top of the bails with an over-arm throw"
19.2,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, SIX runs","Change of angle? It does not matter. Full and angling away outside off. Iyer anticipates it. Shuffles across off, like Dhoni did the other night in Bengaluru, and smokes it over the wide long-on boundary"
19.1,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, SIX runs","Mavi ventures wide of the crease, bowls a full one outside off, Iyer backs away outside leg. He manufactures more swinging room and lifts it inside-out over extra cover for another six"

16.5,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, SIX runs","Iyer now goes over wide long-off for a six. Back of a length on the stumps, he backs away, manufactures swinging room and lifts it over the boundary"
16.4,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, SIX runs","Uthappa drops the catch, parries it over the boundary, and costs KKR six runs. Back of a length and outside off, Iyer flat-bats it to the right of long-on. Uthappa moves swiftly to his right but lets the ball burst through his hands. Brings up a fine fifty"
16.3,"Shivam Mavi to Maxwell, 1 run","slower, short ball outside off, Maxwell waits for this 112.5ks and swats it across the line to deep midwicket"
16.2,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, 1 run","off-stump yorker, 143ks, Iyer jabs his bat down and secures a single to short third man"

14.3,"Russell to Maxwell, 1 run","full and outside off, shuffles across and slices wide of point"
14.2,"Russell to Pant, OUT","Banged in short at off stump, Pant drops his gloves, expecting the ball to climb further. Instead the ball flies off the glove to Karthik behind the stumps. Just a waist-high ball. Inconsistent bounce has brought KKR two wickets in two overs"

14.1,"Russell to Iyer, 1 wide","full-toss heading down leg, wide"
13.6,"Chawla to Shaw, OUT","flat, quick, sneaks under the bat and hits the middle stump. This does not bounce at all. End of a sparkling fifty from Shaw. Another slider from Chawla, skids low, Shaw swings across the line and watches the ball shoot under his bat and rattle the stumps"
13.5,"Chawla to Shaw, no run","Shaw uses his feet, Chawla goes short and cramps him for room. Played back to the bowler in the end"

12.6,"Johnson to Shaw, SIX runs","short and veering into the hips, you've got to got it up higher, Johnson. Shaw sizes it up and short-arms it away over square leg. Sweet swing of the bat"
12.5,"Johnson to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length and angling across off, dabbed down to square-ish third man"
12.4,"Johnson to Iyer, FOUR runs","Iyer now succeeds in ramping it away fine of deep third man. Banged in short just a shade outside off, Iyer arches his back and finds the boundary"

9.3,"Narine to Shaw, 1 run","tossed up and spins in, tickled away with the break wide of Dre Russ at short fine leg. He tests out his right hamstring"

9.1,"Narine to Shaw, 1 run","on a length and swerves away outside off as opposed to turning in, Shaw reaches out for the ball with his hands and carves a single to deep point"
8.6,"Johnson to Shaw, 1 run","short on leg stump, and Shaw's cramped for space. Somehow manages to play it towards the leg side"
8.5,"Johnson to Shaw, SIX runs","oh, ho, ho, delightful! Full on middle stump, and that's been whipped over deep midwicket. Excellent pick-up from Shaw, and sent into the stands"
8.4,"Johnson to Shaw, FOUR runs","good length on off stump, but angling into Shaw's body. Shuffles across to the off side, and flicks it off his pads behind square. Great timing, and the shot beats the man in the deep to the boundary"
8.3,"Johnson to Iyer, 1 run",good length on off and angling across his body. Opens his bat's face and runs it down to third man for a walking single
8.2,"Johnson to Iyer, no run","good length on middle and leg, that's too close to Iyer's body for a square cut. Chooses to open the face of the bat and glance it to point"

7.4,"Russell to Iyer, no run","full on of stump, and that's a crunching drive off the front foot. Excellent sound of the bat, but straight to cover"

7.2,"Russell to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length on the fourth-stump line. Forces Iyer to tiptoe, and defended off the back foot"
7.1,"Russell to Shaw, 1 run","good length on off, and Shaw mistimes a punch to long on. Gets his captain on strike"
6.6,"Shivam Mavi to Munro, OUT","yorked! 143 kph. Full and straight, and Munro's been done in by the pace. Tried to drive, but too close to his body, and that's been inside-edged onto his middle stump. Mavi not afraid to give Munro a send-off"
6.5,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, 1 run","good length on off, and Shaw's in no shape to slog it towards the leg side. A wild shot, really, and it's been mistimed into his left leg. Shaw's hobbling."
6.4,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, no run","rolls his fingers over this one. Back of a length, and very wide outside off. But Shaw's deceived by the pace, and all he can do is mistime a flat-batted shot to mid off"
6.3,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, no run","full on off stump, and Shaw shaped up well to drive this past cover. Can't find the gap, however"
6.2,"Shivam Mavi to Munro, 1 run","short! Good length on middle, and Munro's too slow to pull. Hits his bat's edge, and then ricochets onto his knee. That must've stung"
6.1,"Shivam Mavi to Munro, no run","good length on off and enough space for Munro to cut it square. But misses it completely, and the ball goes through to DK"
5.6,"Johnson to Munro, 1 run","full on middle stump, and slight swing away from his body. Drives it straight to cover, however"
5.5,"Johnson to Shaw, 1 run","it's the offcutter this time. On a good length on leg stump, and flicked off his pads to fine leg"
5.4,"Johnson to Shaw, FOUR runs","slapped over cover! Full outside off, and just enough width for him to free his arms. Bends his knee, and crackles this over the infield. Delightful"
5.3,"Johnson to Shaw, no run","What a take! Short on middle, and Shaw's in to position to deal with this. Flies off the surface and Shaw misses the pull. DK, however, displays some great hang time"
5.2,"Johnson to Shaw, no run","good length on leg stump, and he tries to work it towards square leg. Takes a thick outside edge, but falls short of Gill at short third man. Living dangerously here ."
5.1,"Johnson to Shaw, no run","leading edge! But just short of cover. Good length on middle stump, and Shaw's through with his leg-side flick too early. Almost carried to cover though"
4.6,"Narine to Munro, no run","overpitched on off stump, and Munro's leg-side slog doesn't connect. Inside-edge takes it to mid on instead"
4.5,"Narine to Munro, no run","good length on off, and spinning away from Munro. Tries to cut but the ball zips under his bat"
4.4,"Narine to Munro, SIX runs","Biggie! Good length on middle, and Munro goes down on one knee, and swats this away over deep midwicket! Hit so well that it lands 10 rows back"
4.3,"Narine to Munro, FOUR runs","full on middle, and Munro allows the body to go away from him. Mistimes his drive towards the off-side, but manages to find the gap between cover and cover point"
4.2,"Narine to Munro, no run","good length outside leg, and spinning across Munro's body. Worked off the back foot to midwicket"
4.1,"Narine to Shaw, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and spinning into his body. Tapped off the back foot towards the non-striker"
3.6,"Shivam Mavi to Munro, no run","good length on middle, and Munro's trapped in his crease. Does well to defend it off the back foot"
3.5,"Shivam Mavi to Munro, FOUR runs","back of a length on middle, and Munro comes dancing down the wicket!  Mistimes his flat-batted shot over Mavi, but enough muscle behind it to clear mid on. Daredevils race away to forty"
3.4,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, 1 run","good length outside off, and once again punched off the back foot. Hit behind square this time, and there's a man positioned in the deep"
3.3,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, no run","good length outside off, and Shaw's in position early to cut. Slaps it well, but excellent stop from Rana at point"
3.2,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and Shaw rides the bounce to punch this past point. Kept his bat's face open, and lets the pace of Mavi do the rest"
3.1,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, no run","back of a length outside off, and Shaw misses the ramp. Tried to glance it over short third man, but just timed his shot too late"
2.6,"Chawla to Shaw, 1 run","good length outside off, and sharp spin into Shaw's body. Too close to his body for the cut, and that's been bottom edged"
2.5,"Chawla to Shaw, FOUR runs","short on middle, and angling into Shaw's body. He allows it to come to his body, and then muscles a pull square to the leg side. Deep midwicket can't cut it off"
2.4,"Chawla to Shaw, FOUR runs","full outside off, and Shaw tries to play inside out over cover. Lifts it easily over cover, and there's nobody in the deep either. Expensive second over from Chawla so far"
2.3,"Chawla to Munro, 1 run","good length on middle, and zipping straight through. Quicker one this time, and Munro can only tap it down the ground to mid on"
2.2,"Chawla to Munro, FOUR runs","oh he's feeling it! Full outside off, and forces Munro to reach at it. But he still manages to carve it over point, and once that crosses the infield, there's no stopping that"
2.1,"Chawla to Munro, FOUR runs","drilled down the ground! Full outside off, and smacked straight past the non-striker. Took one big stride forward and then went through with the full followthrough of the bat"
1.6,"Kuldeep to Munro, 1 run","good length on middle, and it's the wrong'un to end the over. Angling into Munro, who is forced to go towards the leg side, and punches to cover"
1.5,"Kuldeep to Munro, SIX runs","short outside off, and that was aching to be punished. Munro goes deep into his crease and flat-bats it over Kuldeep's head! That sounded sweet"
1.4,"Kuldeep to Munro, no run","good length outside off, and spinning further away. Tapped off the back foot to mid on"
1.3,"Kuldeep to Shaw, 1 run","tossed up on off, and that's been swept well! Drilled straight to the man at deep backward square. Shaw was quick to gauge the length there"
1.2,"Kuldeep to Munro, 1 run","good length outside off, but slow in the air. Punched off the back foot to long on for a walking single"
1.1,"Kuldeep to Shaw, 1 run","good length on middle and angling away from Shaw. Goes onto the back foot, and whips this down the ground to long on. Gets Munro on strike for the first time"
0.6,"Chawla to Shaw, 1 run","full outside off, and the wrong'un is picked up early by Shaw. Goes down on one knee, and slogs this towards deep midwicket. Man there though"
0.5,"Chawla to Shaw, no run","good length outside off, but slightly low this time. Shaw tries to cut, but mistimed to point"
0.4,"Chawla to Shaw, no run","full on middle and leg, and going down the leg side. Shaw tries to work it towards square leg, but misses. Appeal for lbw but the umpire isn't interested"
0.3,"Chawla to Shaw, 2 runs","good length outside off, and legspin this time. Shaw walks to the pitch of the ball and smothers it towards midwicket. Calls early for the second run"
0.2,"Chawla to Shaw, no run","full outside off, and zipping into Shaw's body once again. Tries an expansive drive but checks his shot at the last moment. Tapped towards cover"
0.1,"Chawla to Shaw, no run","full outside off, and that's sliding into Shaw. He does well to defend the first ball back to Chawla off the front foot"
19.2,"Basil to Rajpoot, OUT","Base of middle Thampi seals the game! The simplest way to knock over the tailender. Go full, go straight, watch him flop around like mad and knock the stumps over. Rajpoot goes for the scoop, so he probably expected the fuller ball, just couldn't come out the right side of the gamble"
19.1,"Basil to Mujeeb, 1 leg bye","goes for the inswinging yorker at 141 kph, Mujeeb clears the front leg to heave it through midwicket. Gets struck on the back pad and pinches a run to point"
18.6,"Kaul to Rajpoot, no run","knuckle ball misses off stump by a whisker! Rajpoot goes for the six over long-on and for all the good it does, he may as well been a card board cut out of himself"
18.5,"Kaul to Rajpoot, FOUR runs","inside edge! This game has had everything, and now this too. A trusty slog that becomes a sneaky boundary, beating Thampi"
18.4,"Kaul to Mujeeb, 1 run","stands still and tall at the crease, no sign of nerves and cuts the short ball to long-off. Gee, this is a special kid."
18.3,"Kaul to Rajpoot, 1 run","slower ball, hiding it outside off, and Rajpoot only just catches up with it as he slashes it to long-off"
18.2,"Kaul to Mujeeb, 1 run","he walks right across his stumps to heave the full delivery from the wide line out to deep midwicket. These nine runs, by the way, are Mujeeb's first in all T20 cricket"
18.1,"Kaul to Rajpoot, 1 bye","swings hard, swings blind, to be completely beaten. Saha fumbles behind the stumps and they sneak the bye"
17.6,"Rashid Khan to Mujeeb, FOUR runs","another reverse sweep, another boundary, this time over short fine leg! This game's alive and kicking again. Rashid tries to keep it away from the batsman's hitting arc, bowling wide outside off. But Mujeeb's the wunderkind. So obviously he pulls off this outrageous shot"
17.5,"Rashid Khan to Mujeeb, FOUR runs","whoa! Reverse sweeps his countryman to the backward point boundary, taking a quick delivery on leg stump out for a night on the town!"
17.4,"Rashid Khan to Rajpoot, 1 run","comes down the track and swings a long hop (yep, he seems capable of bowling those too) to short fine leg"
17.3,"Rashid Khan to Rajpoot, no run",almost finishes it as a quick leg break beats Rajpoot's swing and somehow takes pity on off stump. Allows it to stay standing
17.2,"Rashid Khan to Ashwin, OUT","backs away and toe-ends the slash meant to go over the cover and watches his opposite number settle under a simple catch on the edge of the 30-yard circle. Rashid spreads his arms and soaks in the moment. Either that, or he's saying, ""yeah, this is me. Deal with it"""
17.1,"Rashid Khan to Rajpoot, 1 run","slogs again, but this time, his mis-hit saves him so much that the ball lands short of midwicket running in off the boundary"
16.6,"Kaul to Rajpoot, 1 run","dropped by Nabi at long-on! The man with a five-for wants to finish it in a blaze of glory. Takes on a hard length with a big ole slog. The ball soars up, swirls in the air, comes down into a pair of waiting hands and then pops  right back out."
16.5,"Kaul to Barinder Sran, OUT","and now the wicketkeeper runs out the batsman! Kings XI are pulling off a spectacular collapse. And Sran's little contribution is a toe-end slog that goes into the slips, making him believe there is a single. Ashwin knows there isn't and sends the batsman back. Meanwhile, Saha runs across, grabs the ball, takes aim and topples the stumps."
16.4,"Kaul to Barinder Sran, no run",clears the front leg to swing hard and swing free. But the change of pace - knuckle ball - does not allow him to make contact
16.3,"Kaul to Ashwin, 1 run","backs away and slaps a shortish delivery to the sweeper cover, where Rashid keeps it to only one."
16.2,"Kaul to Barinder Sran, 1 run",flat-bats a short ball to long-off
16.1,"Kaul to Barinder Sran, no run","back of a length, giving him absolutely no room. Sran plays half a cut shot and the ball skews out towards cover"
15.6,"Sandeep to Barinder Sran, 1 run","fullish and outside off, he blocks to point and says no for the run, but Ashwin pulls him through"
15.5,"Sandeep to Tye, OUT","traps him in front, but Tye has reviewed! It's the knuckle ball - now that's a story to tell, Tye's a legend with that variation but he doesn't pick it. Swings all across the line, feet planted in the crease. Replays says there is no bat, HawkEye says it is clipping just enough of leg stump to make it umpire's call."
15.4,"Sandeep to Tye, FOUR runs","dropped by Shakib, but this is a seriously tough chance, with the ball going a mile high, swirling in the air, coming down perfectly straight, bisecting long-on (Shakib) and long-off. Big effort from the Bangladeshi, but it's in vain"
15.3,"Sandeep to Tiwary, OUT","slower ball, it loops off the bat and settles in the SRH captain's hands at short midwicket. Sunrisers are breaking out of jail again. Should Bhuvneshwar Kumar worry about his place in the XI now? They're making mincemeat of a top batting line-up without him. Case in point, this special little variation, having Tiwary reach in front of him for a flick shot and making the ball kick up off the pitch to ping off the high part of the bat and into safe hands"
15.2,"Sandeep to Tiwary, no run",slower ball - the legcutter. Tiwary slices it to point and looks for a quick single. Ashwin says no
15.1,"Sandeep to Ashwin, 1 run",walks at the bowler and taps a back of a length delivery to long-on
14.6,"Shakib to Ashwin, 1 run",turns a good length ball on middle through midwicket
14.5,"Shakib to Ashwin, no run","comes down the track to try and nudge it to midwicket. But the ball drifts in a little too much for him to make contact. Big shout for lbw, but that's shot down. Then there's indecision between the batsman over taking a single. Nerves jangling everywhere!"
14.4,"Shakib to Tiwary, 1 run","full and outside off, Tiwary drives to long-off"
14.3,"Shakib to Ashwin, 1 run",presses forward to block a fuller delivery to the left of cover
14.2,"Shakib to Finch, OUT","taken at long-on, right on the edge of the boundary, with less than an inch leg! Pandey, you legend! Hyderabad is awake. The Kings XI are slowly falling asleep at the wheel. Finch wants another six to his name, wants to finish this off quickly, but that is a long straight boundary and even with perfect connection in the last ball, he only just cleared it"
14.1,"Shakib to Finch, SIX runs",sees some flight and decides it has to go. Violent swing over long-on
13.6,"Rashid Khan to Tiwary, no run","loads up the sweep, but he's through the shot - Rassshiiiid . his ability to change the pace in accordance to the desperation of the batsman is just unreal. The ball jumps over the top edge, lobs off the shoulder and then to slip"
13.5,"Rashid Khan to Tiwary, no run","huge appeal, Rashid wants the review, Saha says high and there's a mini conference, in the end there is no review. What a beauty though. He angles the leg break into the right-hander, but doesn't let him reach the pitch. Tiwary is lunging forward, he's off balance, he's closing the bat face and is beaten on the inside edge. The ball strikes his back thigh, in line with off stump. But is it high?"
13.4,"Rashid Khan to Nair, OUT","doesn't read the googly! Ignorance is clearly not bliss, at least if you're Karun Nair and Kings XI. The poor guy gets forward to block what he thinks is a leg break and is comfortably beaten on the inside edge. Great control of length from Rashid, suddenly pushing this one fuller, and slowing the pace too."
13.3,"Rashid Khan to Finch, 1 run",goes for the sweep before the ball even comes down the pitch. Rashid adjusts by pulling his length back and offers only a single to square leg.
13.2,"Rashid Khan to Nair, 1 run",a touch shorter than he likes to be and that allows Nair to tap it down to long-on
13.1,"Rashid Khan to Nair, no run",beaten by the legbreak as Rashid pitches it on a good length and gets the ball to hurry off the pitch. That quick arm action again 
12.6,"Shakib to Nair, 1 run","premeditates a sweep and only just pulls it off, with the bat hacking down on the ball like an axe"
12.5,"Shakib to Nair, no run","full and outside off, drives to cover, where Williamson doesn't let it through"
12.4,"Shakib to Finch, 1 run","full on middle, Finch knocks it down to long-on"
12.3,"Shakib to Nair, 1 run",sweeps a tossed up delivery from outside off to deep square leg
12.2,"Shakib to Nair, no run",he drives the flighted ball on off stump back to the bowler
12.1,"Shakib to Agarwal, OUT","long straight boundaries here, and Agarwal chooses to take them on despite not being to the pitch of this Shakib special. There's enough flight to draw the batsman forward, even out of his crease, and yet he still can't get near the ball. That little distance he has to reach forward to make contact ruins his timing. Fiftieth IPL wicket for Shakib"
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Nair, no run",stays back and blocks the flatter delivery on middle
11.5,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, 1 run",pitches it up and gets it to skid into the right-hander as Agarwal plays a leg glance to short fine leg
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, no run","loops it up, and keeps it outside off. Agarwal looks for the slap through cover and is beaten"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Nair, 1 run","pulls to deep square leg; a rare slower, short ball from Rashid"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, 1 run","looks for the pull, but the ball skids off the pitch and does not give him enough time to hit properly. Single to long-on"
11.1,"Rashid Khan to Nair, 1 run","goes back, thinking this short ball is a legbreak, but it nips back in and messes with his cut shot"
10.6,"Kaul to Nair, 1 run","full on middle and leg, clips it through square leg"
10.5,"Kaul to Agarwal, 1 run","top-edges the pull but he manages to evade the bowler's reach and the ball plops somewhere in front of the imaginary mid-on. Another good short ball from Kaul, rising up to the chest and giving no room to swing"
10.4,"Kaul to Nair, 1 run",lifts the short of a good length ball off his hips to deep square leg
10.3,"Kaul to Agarwal, 1 run",opens the face and slices the back of a length delivery outside off to deep third man
10.2,"Kaul to Agarwal, no run","blocks a shortish delivery angled into the right-hander. He did this to Hardik Pandya and kept him quiet, refusing him any hitting room"
10.1,"Kaul to Agarwal, 2 runs","works it off his hips to long leg, and Rashid hits the turf after being off-balance in trying to throw the ball in quickly"
9.6,"Shakib to Nair, 2 runs","leans into this tossed up ball on leg stump, turns it to deep square leg and pinches a couple of runs before the fielder knows what's up"
9.5,"Shakib to Agarwal, 1 run","clears the front leg and whips a quick, flat delivery on leg stump to wide long-on"
9.4,"Shakib to Agarwal, no run",winds up for an inside-out cover drive. But he mis-hits back to the bowler
9.3,"Shakib to Nair, 1 run",closes the face to nudge a tossed up delivery on off stump to deep midwicket
9.2,"Shakib to Nair, no run",covers the line of this fuller - but flatter - delivery on middle and keeps it out
9.1,"Shakib to Nair, 2 runs",full toss wide outside off and Nair laces it through the covers

8.5,"Basil to Agarwal, 1 run",smacks a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
8.4,"Basil to Agarwal, no run","back of a length and outside off, slices it to backward point"
8.3,"Basil to Agarwal, 2 runs","works it between fine leg and long leg. And oh, there's a collision between Rashid and Kaul! And the legspinner is gingerly feeling his bowling shoulder. Oh dear "
8.2,"Basil to Gayle, OUT","can you hear the noise?! The screams of the Sunrisers. The absolute joy in the crowd. Basil Thampi is responsible for all of it. Started the season on the bench. But here he is, taking out the Bradman of T20 cricket, with an honest to goodness super dooper bouncer. It's quick. Its from around the wicket. It comes at his chest. The pull shot malfunctions. Top edge straight up and Thampi takes the catch himself somewhere around short leg"
8.1,"Basil to Agarwal, 1 run",glides a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, 1 run",slices a tossed up delivery on off stump to deep point
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, OUT","how  what . just  why. That just should not happen! Rahul covers the stumps. He gets a good stride forward. He looks all set to defend this good-length legbreak on off stump. Except, it finds a way past the outside edge and then clatter into sticks like it was always destined to. Plays for the googly. Done in by the legbreak. Unreal bowling from the best in the business"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, 1 run",goes for the big wind up and slogs a fuller delivery on off stump to deep midwicket. Mistimes it though
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run","all of Hyderabad roars for an lbw appeal. But this good length ball, skidding through to beat Gayle's flick originally pitched outside leg"
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run",hangs back and punches the googly down the ground to long-on
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, no run","b-e-a-uty! He has an in-form batsman lunging forward, reaching for the ball, unsure of how it turns. That bat may as well have been a chop stick"
6.6,"Basil to Gayle, no run","full on leg stump, Gayle taps it to midwicket"
6.5,"Basil to Rahul, 1 run",a gentle little nudge to deep square leg
6.4,"Basil to Gayle, 1 run","bisects the fielders with a mis-hit! Luck be with Gayle-y to-niiiiight. Also, that slice off the outside edge, landing between point and deep third man brings up the fifty partnership as well."
6.3,"Basil to Gayle, SIX runs","there it goes! High into the night sky. Up into the second tier above long-on. And all Gayle does is clear the front leg and give it the full swing. Jeez, how much power does he have?"
6.2,"Basil to Gayle, no run",squares him up - if only a tiny bit - with a shortish delivery on off stump from around the wicket. Gayle blocks to point
6.1,"Basil to Rahul, 1 run",stands nice and tall over this delivery on his pads and clips it to deep midwicket. Very slick.
5.6,"Kaul to Gayle, no run","full on off stump, Gayle looks to go big down the ground - that's more like it - but he gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
5.5,"Kaul to Gayle, FOUR runs",spears it between short third man and point. These are not shots normally associated with Gayle. Just like he was never meant to get a century with a quick single. So you can understand Kaul going wide yorker. And then going wide-eyed
5.4,"Kaul to Rahul, 1 run","full on middle, he drills it to long-on"
5.3,"Kaul to Rahul, no run","falls short of short third man as Rahul attempts another unreal shot - the late cut to a short ball angled into him. And on this occasion, even the batsman mistiming a shot doesn't help Sunrisers as Sandeep dives forward but can't get there"
5.2,"Kaul to Rahul, FOUR runs","outrageous! He walks down the pitch, the bowler tops him by shortening his length, but Rahul says I'm good enough to still hit down the ground. Stands up taller, that bottom hand grips the bat tighter and he somehow gets on top of the bounce to clear mid-on"
5.1,"Kaul to Rahul, no run",tucks a fuller delivery on leg stump to midwicket
4.6,"Sandeep to Gayle, no run",picks the change of pace and defends the 119 kph delivery in front of off stump
4.5,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run",comes down the track to a slower ball and clips it through square leg
4.4,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","full on middle and leg, he keeps it out"
4.3,"Sandeep to Rahul, FOUR runs","buh-rilllllllliant cover drive! It's up there for the shot, but the put away is pure no-nonsense awesomeness. Lovely stride forward, perfectly straight bat, gorgeous timing"
4.2,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","shortish on and around middle, Rahul knocks it down to midwicket"
4.1,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","knuckle ball? In any case, it deviates away from the right-hander, and rather late too. Rahul is playing in front of his body, with a closed bat face, and gets a leading edge"
3.6,"M Nabi to Rahul, 1 run",full on middle stump. Rahul goes back and pushes it to mid on. Enough time to take another single
3.5,"M Nabi to Rahul, FOUR runs","full on off, but Rahul walks across to the off side and sweeps this over short fine leg! Some form he's in. Got inside the line of the ball and punished it once again"
3.4,"M Nabi to Rahul, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and enough width for Rahul to cut it square. Takes a step towards the leg side to make extra room, and crunches this past point thereafter"
3.3,"M Nabi to Rahul, SIX runs","short on off stump, and Rahul's waiting to pounce on that length. Rocks back onto the back foot and pulls over deep midwicket!"
3.2,"M Nabi to Gayle, 1 run","good length outside off, and the bounce gets big on Gayle. Still manages to turn it towards mid on for a quick run"
3.1,"M Nabi to Gayle, no run",back of a length on off and cramping Gayle for room. Defended to mid on
2.6,"Sandeep to Gayle, 1 run","full on middle stump, and Gayle check-drives to mid on. He wants the single though, and sprints across to the non-striker's end. Williamson's throw can't get the direct hit"
2.5,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, full on middle and leg. Rahul keeps his eyes on the ball and judges the pace early. Whips it towards deep midwicket with the use of his wrists thereafter"
2.4,"Sandeep to Gayle, 1 run","full on leg stump, and easy clipped off his pads to deep midwicket. Gayle is more than happy to walk across to the other end for a single"
2.3,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","good length on the fourth-stump line, and Rahul taps it down the ground to mid off. Forced to call for the quick single, and they eventually scamper through comfortably"
2.2,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","good length on off stump, and slightly shaping into Rahul's body. Fended off the back foot with soft hands"
2.1,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","good length outside off, and that back-foot punch is timed well. But straight to cover"
1.6,"M Nabi to Gayle, no run","appeal for stumped! It was wide outside off, and Gayle lets it go thinking it'll go for a wide but knows fully well where his popping crease is. Slides his back leg inside the line before Saha whips the bails off"
1.5,"M Nabi to Rahul, 1 run","good length on off and Rahul goes onto the back foot. Punches it straight, and off the bat's top half. Falls just in front of Nabi and then sneaks under his body to long on"
1.4,"M Nabi to Gayle, 1 run","falls just short of long off! Fast and flat outside off, and Gayle crunches it down the ground. Was in the air for a bit. Pandey the man there"
1.3,"M Nabi to Gayle, no run","full on middle stump, but going down the leg side. Gayle tries to whip it behind square but it hits his pads"
1.2,"M Nabi to Gayle, SIX runs","over long off Full on off, and Gayle comes shimmying down the ground before lifting it over Nabi. Checks his shot, but still enough to clear the boundary"
1.1,"M Nabi to Gayle, no run","full on off stump, but no real spin this time. Defended off the front foot"
0.6,"Sandeep to Gayle, 1 run","good length on leg stump, but Gayle waits for the ball to go across his body. Opens his bat's face and glanced it towards point"
0.5,"Sandeep to Gayle, no run",full on middle stump but tailing across Gayle's body again. Takes a big stride forward and taps it towards cover
0.4,"Sandeep to Gayle, no run",full on middle and swinging across Gayle's bat. He tried to defend off the front foot after covering his off stump. Through to Saha
0.3,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","good length outside off, but tailing into Rahul's pads again. Flicked off his pads to square leg and loud cheers as Gayle gets on strike"
0.2,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","full outside off but swinging into his pads late. Rahul shuffles across to the off side, and pushes towards midwicket"
0.1,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run",full on off stump. Rahul takes a stride forward and fends it back to Sandeep
19.6,"Rajpoot to M Nabi, OUT","five-for, that's his career-best figures, and the best this season as well. Great work from Rajpoot, going full, going straight, giving very little leverage for the batsman. Nabi tries his best to launch it down the ground, but it only carries to long-off"
19.5,"Rajpoot to M Nabi, FOUR runs",sets up deep in his crease and slashes a short and wide delivery point point's head. No one in the deep to stop that.
19.4,"Rajpoot to Pandey, OUT","the perfect yorker! It starts from wide of the crease, hones in on middle and leg, takes a detour off the front pad and knocks over middle. Top stuff from the uncapped fast bowler, who now has four wickets in the game"
19.3,"Rajpoot to Pathan, 1 bye","goes for the bouncer as Yusuf starts to duck, then pokes the bat up like a periscope, and eventually accepts Pandey's call to get off strike so balls aren't wasted"
19.2,"Rajpoot to Pathan, no run","goes wide of the crease looking for the wide yorker. It results in a full toss and Yusuf only manages an outside edge, on the bounce, to the wicketkeeper"
19.1,"Rajpoot to Pandey, 1 run","back of a length and outside off, Pandey inside edges the cut into where silly point would be"
18.6,"Tye to Pathan, no run","full and outside off, Yusuf clatters it back into the bowler's hands"
18.5,"Tye to Pathan, FOUR runs",straying on the pads and Yusuf deflects it away to the fine leg boundary. Rare bad ball from the death-overs specialist
18.4,"Tye to Pathan, no run",bouncer - at top pace - and Yusuf is comfortably beaten on the hook shot
18.3,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run",clears his front leg to take care of a near-yorker on middle and leg. Single to deep midwicket
18.2,"Tye to Pandey, FOUR runs","opens the face and launches the intended wide yorker over extra cover. That's fifty, off 48 balls."
18.1,"Tye to Pandey, no run",misses a leg-stump full toss and is struck on the pad. Late inswing for Tye
17.6,"Ashwin to Pathan, no run",carrom ball that skirts the wide line. Yusuf wants to pulverise it. He ends up being beaten by it. #Irony
17.5,"Ashwin to Pathan, 2 runs","short and outside off, wallops it to sweeper cover . and do we have a run-out?. Miller subbing for Mujeeb sends in a lovely throw - flat and hard and right over the stumps - but Yusuf's dive saves him"
17.4,"Ashwin to Pathan, 2 runs",nudges a full delivery on off stump through to long-on
17.3,"Ashwin to Pathan, SIX runs","dropped at deep midwicket, this time it's Tiwary, waiting on the edge of the boundary, having very little room to manoeuvre. That makes him nervous and that makes him lose it. Yusuf lives to swing across the line again"
17.2,"Ashwin to Pathan, 2 runs","backs away and cuts the legbreak to point. The throw comes in, and it's three or four feet away from the wicketkeeper and nearly results in four overthrows"
17.1,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","starts with a carrom ball on middle and off, Pandey works it to long-on"
16.6,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run","dropped! Again! That's Pandey's third life of the game as he takes on a slower ball, on a length on middle, and tries to launch it over midwicket. The lack of pace messes with his timing. The height the ball goes messes with the fielder Agarwal"
16.5,"Tye to Pandey, 2 runs","misfield from Ashwin, but it costs only one extra run with deep point still on the boundary. Pandey doing all he can to get a decent score on the board, this time with a late cut to a knuckle ball"
16.4,"Tye to Pathan, 1 run",belts the length ball outside off to long-off
16.3,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run","oooh, that's the length he wants, right in his hitting arc on middle stump. But Tye saves himself some punishment with his change of pace. Pandey swings hard and gets an inside edge onto pad"
16.2,"Tye to Pandey, no run",wide yorker to follow the mean bouncer. Pandey is not ready for this one either.
16.1,"Tye to Pandey, no run","shapes to cut a short ball that is loath to give him any room. Even though Pandey makes a lot of his own, he doesn't get the result he wants. Beaten"
15.6,"Mujeeb to Pathan, no run","does him again! He has Yusuf reaching outside the off stump, the flight is just so darn delectable. But he just can't reach the pitch of the ball. Ends up driving with an angled face and is beaten on the outside edge"
15.5,"Mujeeb to Pathan, no run","full and outside off, he lunges forward and is beaten on the outside edge. Yusuf is clearly not reading Mujeeb's variations"
15.4,"Mujeeb to Pathan, no run",stays back to a flatter delivery on off stump and taps it down the pitch
15.3,"Mujeeb to Pathan, no run",
15.2,"Mujeeb to Pathan, 2 runs","full and on leg stump, sweeps it to long leg"
15.1,"Mujeeb to Pathan, no run",traps him in the crease with a good length ball on off stump
14.6,"Ashwin to Pandey, SIX runs",right in the slot outside off and Pandey monsters it over midwicket. A-grade hitting
14.5,"Ashwin to Pandey, no run","comes in with his legbreak action, like Anil Kumble, and bowls the offbreak instead. Pandey jams his bat down on the near yorker-length ball"
14.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, FOUR runs",spins past the long leg fielder! That's lucky for Sunrisers and Pandey's hogging it all tonight. Sweeps hard. The ball bounces right in front of the fielder and spins past his left hand
14.3,"Ashwin to Pathan, 1 run",lobs it up tastily above Yusuf's eyeline. The batsman isn't sucked into a big shot and instead hits along the ground to long-off
14.2,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","another carrom ball, against which Pandey comes down the track and pops out to long-off"
14.1,"Ashwin to Pandey, 2 runs","carrom ball, but it's gone short and allows Pandey the room he needs to smack it to the left of long-off. The lack of pace off the pitch, however, means he has no timing"
13.6,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run",drives to long-off
13.5,"Mujeeb to Pathan, 1 run","goes for the late cut, and ends up taking the ball right off off stump. Clooooose"
13.5,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 2 wide","shifts back, gets low, and scoop-pulls to fine leg. The umpire, however, says there is no bat involved and signals wide down leg"
13.4,"Mujeeb to Shakib, OUT","caught at deep midwicket! Mujeeb, who took a cricket ball to his eye, is bowling like a champion. Taking pace off the ball and preying on the pressure piling on the batsman. Shakib goes for the slog. Mistimes it badly and has to walk back"
13.3,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run","pops up but it's too far away from Mujeeb, on his right, to be a chance. Beautiful bowling from the young offspinner, holding the ball back, deceiving Pandey in flight and dip."
13.2,"Mujeeb to Shakib, 1 run","oooh, that cuts back in sharply off the pitch. The length is such that the left-hander thinks it is ripe to cut. But with the ball spinning the wrong way, Shakib has to work overtime in pulling the shot off"
13.1,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run","follows the batsman as he makes room and as a result, Pandey can only push it to long-off for a single"
12.6,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run","fuil and outside off, smears it to long-on"
12.5,"Tye to Shakib, 1 run","moves back and across again, but this time, Tye does better, pitching the ball up, but not so far that it is a half-volley. With nothing to get under, and no room to work with, he mis-hits to short fine leg"
12.4,"Tye to Shakib, 2 runs","back to top pace, and it's a yorker too, on leg stump. Basically the worst ball to deal with as a batsman. And Shakib works it to deep square leg"
12.3,"Tye to Shakib, no run","misses a full toss. Well, if there was any doubt over how hard it is to pick an Andrew Tye slower ball "
12.2,"Tye to Shakib, FOUR runs","yep, have to go, have to do something. And so Shakib walks across and pulls a slow, short ball away to the long leg boundary. Really good batting. Targeted the vacant area, so reduced the risk involved"
12.1,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run",full and outside off - but it's slow. So very slow. Pandey is preparing to paste it through the covers and has to adjust his shot considering the lack of pace. Single to long-off as the bat turns in his hand while making contact
11.6,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run","leans forward and flicks a slow, tossed up delivery on off stump through straight midwicket"
11.5,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 2 runs","another late cut, this time Pandey making sound connection as he beats the diving Sran to his left"
11.4,"Mujeeb to Pandey, no run",beaten as the offspinner gets more bounce than turn and Pandey is looking for the non-existent turn with a late cut
11.3,"Mujeeb to Shakib, 1 run",makes him reach - an instinctive change in line as he sees Shakib backing away - and produces a miscued cut to third man
11.2,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run",adjusts better to the pace of Mujeeb and plants the ball in the gap at cover
11.1,"Mujeeb to Pandey, no run","the batsmen must feel like this pitch can't make up its mind. To the quicks, it's fast and bounce. To the spinners, it keeps stopping. Pandey, here, all set to punch through cover, gets an inside edge back to the bowler"
10.6,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run","overpitched wide outside off, and it's an attempted drive from Pandey. Comes off the bat's toe end but sneaks through between the umpire and non-striker. Man at long on, however"
10.5,"Tye to Pandey, no run","back of a length outside off, and Manish makes some extra way. Opens his bat's face and slices a cut to short third man"
10.4,"Tye to Pandey, no run","slower ball, on a good length. Wide outside off, and Pandey's been deceived by the pace once again. Tries to cut but the ball goes over his blade"
10.3,"Tye to Pandey, 2 runs","slower ball again. Back of a length outside off, and mistimes the pull again. Comes off the bat's bottom-half and trickles away towards midwicket. The lack of pace behind that shot allows him to come back for another run"
10.2,"Tye to Shakib, 1 run","short on middle, and Shakib's quick to swivel and pull. But mistimed towards midwicket, which allows them to scamper across for one"
10.1,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, and starts off with the cutter. Pandey's through his drive too early, and takes a thick-ish edge. Falls just short of point though. Well deceived!"
9.6,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run","full just outside off, but spinning sharply into the right-hander's pads. Big stride forward and whipped towards midwicket"
9.5,"Mujeeb to Shakib, 1 run","good length outside off, and Shakib goes deep inside the crease. Taps it towards mid on for a walking single"
9.4,"Mujeeb to Shakib, no run",back of a length on off but angling into Shakib. Goes onto the back foot and fends it back to the bowler
9.3,"Mujeeb to Shakib, no run","good length outside off, and extra bounce this time. Misses the cut"
9.2,"Mujeeb to Shakib, no run","good length outside off, and no spin this time. Cut off the back foot, but straight to point"
9.1,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run","full on middle stump, and easily worked off his pads towards the vacant square-leg region"
8.6,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run",backs away and taps the shortish delivery to long-off
8.5,"Ashwin to Pandey, no run","keeps it wicket to wicket and Pandey, without any room, can only block"
8.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, 2 runs","fuller little carrom ball outside off, drives into the covers, where Mujeeb misfields rather badly"
8.3,"Ashwin to Pandey, no run","holds the offbreak back, and Pandey is sucked in by the flight on this, goes through with the sweep shot way too early and misses altogether"
8.2,"Ashwin to Shakib, 1 run",whips a flat delivery on off stump down to long-on
8.1,"Ashwin to Shakib, no run",blocks the fuller delivery on off stump
7.6,"Tiwary to Shakib, 1 run","good length on middle stump from around the wicket, with the normal action. Shakib knocks it to long-off"
7.5,"Tiwary to Pandey, 1 run",that's the high-arm action and Pandey drills the half-volley to deep cover
7.4,"Tiwary to Shakib, 1 run",goes back and slaps a shortish delivery on off stump through to long-off
7.4,"Tiwary to Shakib, 3 wide","slow through the air, barely wanting the ball to bounce with that side-arm action. It goes down leg and Rahul fumbles."
7.3,"Tiwary to Shakib, 2 runs","full and outside off, drives smoothly through to the sweeper cover"
7.2,"Tiwary to Pandey, 1 run","the ball comes out of his hand at around stump-high, as he bends his front knee and crouches in his action! Pandey stays still and works it through midwicket"
7.1,"Tiwary to Shakib, 1 run","around the wicket to bowl side-arm offbreaks, like Kedar Jadhav. Shakib works it behind square leg"
6.6,"Ashwin to Shakib, 1 run","is that a run-out. Ah, no. Ashwin loses the ball as he tries to guide it onto the stumps. So Shakib survives after a nudge into the covers and running a tad bit lazily"
6.5,"Ashwin to Shakib, no run",backs away as the good length offbreak comes in with the angle. Shakib punches it to cover
6.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run",hangs back and works a good length ball (still offbreak) on middle to deep square leg
6.3,"Ashwin to Shakib, 1 run",knocks it down to long-on
6.2,"Ashwin to Shakib, no run","inside edge as Ashwin catches Shakib in the crease with a lovely length, just around the 4 m mark. The ball comes in with the angle and messes up the batsman's timing further"
6.1,"Ashwin to Shakib, no run",cuts the shortish delivery outside off from around the wicket to point.
5.6,"Barinder Sran to Pandey, no run",pokes it into the covers and looks for a single off the misfield. Shakib says no.
5.5,"Barinder Sran to Shakib, 1 run","top effort at short cover, Tiwary diving to his left to stop a scorching drive"
5.4,"Barinder Sran to Shakib, FOUR runs","blistering hit! He is such a clean striker, especially with the cut shot. And he will have plenty of opportunity to play that on this bouncy pitch. Third man and point may as well be doing the crossword"
5.3,"Barinder Sran to Shakib, no run","back of a length on off stump, blocks it"
5.2,"Barinder Sran to Shakib, FOUR runs","dude should have been out last ball, instead he gets a hip-high full toss as a free hit and launches it to the square leg boundary. This is the craziest Powerplay ever!"
5.2,"Barinder Sran to Shakib, (no ball)","picks out third man! What is happening?! Shakib takes aim at a short and wide delivery and top-edges it straight down to third man. Oh, but wait! It's a no-ball! Shakib gets a life now! That's three wickets mucked up by Kings XI within the first 32 deliveries of the game."
5.1,"Barinder Sran to Shakib, no run",goes for the drive on the up - a dangerous shot on a bouncy pitch. Finds cover
4.6,"Rajpoot to Pandey, no run","dropped by the same man who gobbled up the last catch! Tye is in the firing line of a fierce pull shot from Pandey (loads of power, poor placement) and he fumbles an absolute dolly. Pandey gets a second life in the Powerplay"
4.5,"Rajpoot to Saha, OUT","taken at midwicket! Rajpoot is winning this on his own!  Meanwhile, Saha, the experienced Saha, the man who should have dropped anchor after the openers fell, goes for an ugly slog and gets a top edge. Sunrisers fans, look away."
4.4,"Rajpoot to Pandey, 1 run","shortish on off stump, steers it towards point"
4.3,"Rajpoot to Pandey, 2 runs","slots it between extra cover and mid-off, Ashwin catches up with it, puts in a dive and saves a few runs."
4.2,"Rajpoot to Saha, 1 run",opens the face and runs the short delivery to third man
4.1,"Rajpoot to Saha, no run","full and swinging away on off stump, Saha pushes to cover"
3.6,"Barinder Sran to Pandey, 2 runs","dropped by Ashwin running back from mid-off! He moves a little slowly, perhaps because he has to keep track of the ball over his shoulder. Reaches out in desperation and ends up fluffing a mostly straightforward chance. And so Pandey gets a reprieve. Dude plays sweet shots, and then loses his head straight after. Like here, when he looks to take on a good length ball on off stump and lift it over mid-on. Not the shot to play on this pacy pitch"
3.5,"Barinder Sran to Pandey, no run",shortens his length immediately and pushes the ball further across the right-hander. Pandey leaves
3.4,"Barinder Sran to Pandey, FOUR runs","magics it to midwicket! This is Virat Kohli territory, taking a good length ball on middle and off and ushering it to a legside boundary with great poise"
3.3,"Barinder Sran to Saha, 1 run",some cut back in off the pitch surprises Saha as he blocks the ball with soft hands and trots across to the other end
3.2,"Barinder Sran to Saha, no run",rides the bounce on this short of a length delivery outside off and guides it to point
3.1,"Barinder Sran to Saha, no run","leans into a lovely cover drive, but that off side field is better packed than a jam jar"
2.6,"Rajpoot to Pandey, no run","good length on middle, pushes it down the pitch. Pandey is a senior player in bad form. If ever there was a time to come good "
2.5,"Rajpoot to Pandey, no run","forces the batsman off his feet to deal with this short ball angled in at middle. Oof, this is top-class new-ball bowling"
2.4,"Rajpoot to Pandey, no run","he's probing away, just outside off, generating steep bounce. Pandey chooses to leave again"
2.3,"Rajpoot to Pandey, no run","good length, outside off, Pandey ignores it like the due date on a phone bill"
2.2,"Rajpoot to S Dhawan, OUT","special bowling! It's bounce again, only this time it happens with the ball moving away from the batsman. Dhawan is squared up. He needs to play, but he's not sure how to. Ends up poking the bat out and offers the outside edge. Karun Nair at slip dives forward and takes a lovely catch."
2.1,"Rajpoot to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","that's supreme skill. He reads the length of this short ball so early. He doesn't mind that the ball is decking into him, not giving him too much room. But the left-hander still goes for the late cut and gets it away to the third man boundary"
1.6,"Barinder Sran to Saha, FOUR runs","the right-left combo spawning a few mistakes. Sran strays on Saha's pads, who deftly turns it to the fine leg boundary. That ball would've been perfect for Dhawan"
1.5,"Barinder Sran to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye","flicks off the pad to the right of the wicketkeeper. Dhawan's little leg glance doesn't quite have the, um, legs"
1.4,"Barinder Sran to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","ooh, that's crunched. He sees width, He throws his hands at it. And then watches the ball skip away to the cover point boundary."
1.3,"Barinder Sran to S Dhawan, no run","beaten with a bouncer! Oooh, this is a ripper of a start. On a true pitch with plenty of kick for the quicks, Sran hits the deck and gets the ball to rise up to Dhawan's neck. He goes for the hook and comes up a distant second"
1.2,"Barinder Sran to S Dhawan, 2 runs",sweetly hit as he waits for the full delivery on the pads and whips it through square leg
1.1,"Barinder Sran to S Dhawan, no run",cramps Dhawan for room and the batsman can only chop it down by his feet
0.6,"Rajpoot to Saha, no run","covers the line of this back of a length delivery, just outside off, at 137 kph"
0.5,"Rajpoot to Saha, no run",gets forward for a Test-match block
0.4,"Rajpoot to Williamson, OUT","bounced out! Because Williamson isn't prepared for it to kick up off the pitch as it does. He sees the ball pitching short, believes there is enough room on offer for the pull, goes through with the shot, but only splices it to mid-off. Ashwin takes a simple catch. Kings XI draw first blood."
0.3,"Rajpoot to Williamson, no run","glorious strike, standing up on those tippy-toes to crunch a shortish delivery to point. That lovely vertical bat. That sexy high elbow. Excuse me for a moment "
0.2,"Rajpoot to Williamson, no run","back of a length and outside off, Williamson lets it through"
0.1,"Rajpoot to S Dhawan, 1 run","carves it away  third man's lining it up . but it falls short! Whoa. Talk about anti-climax! And to make it worse, Mujeeb, the fielder, gets struck in the eye as the ball bounces up at him. He's going off the field"
19.4,"Anderson to Dhoni, SIX runs","crackalicious! How's that to win the match - a six over wide long-on with so much strength it's landed into the crowd. Dhoni absolutely bludgeoned that by going across and swinging it over the cow corner like that night at Wankhede in April 2011. Bravo lifts his arms and goes across to embrace MS Dhoni, who's cool as ever. Harbhajan comes out and lifts Dhoni!"
19.3,"Anderson to Bravo, 1 run","another shortish ball outside off, Bravo stays back and cuts it over point for one"
19.2,"Anderson to Bravo, SIX runs","it's that trademark Bravo loft over the covers. Short ball on off, enough room for Bravo to throw everything at it, big and hard hit and it's sailed over the off side"
19.1,"Anderson to Bravo, FOUR runs","edged and just past the keeper for four! He rolled his fingers over that short ball, it bounced well and Bravo hooked, got an edge and it went just over de Kock's leap"
18.6,"Siraj to Dhoni, 2 runs","too full, driven straight back and it hits the stumps. Oh, it's deflected to the leg side and they come back for the second"
18.6,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 wide","short and wide, Dhoni swings and that moves away further for another wide"
18.6,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 wide","one more wide, this one's gone far down the off side. Pressure goes back to the bowler after a really good start"
18.6,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 wide","slow bouncer, it bounces so much that Dhoni lets it go over him for a wide"
18.5,"Siraj to Dhoni, SIX runs","have you seen that before?! Low full toss and Dhoni slices it for six over point! Not a bad ball, only slightly inaccurate but these get punished in the death"
18.4,"Siraj to Bravo, 1 run","full toss, slightly high, and Bravo can't middle it as he sends it down to long off. It dipped a bit and Bravo came down the track so not a no ball"
18.3,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 run","good, wide yorker from Siraj. Dhoni jams his bat into the ground to send it to point"
18.2,"Siraj to Bravo, 1 run","almost gets the block hole again, Bravo slams it down to long off"
18.1,"Siraj to Bravo, no run","low yorker outside off, almost a low full toss and Bravo gets a tiny edge to the keeper"
17.6,"Anderson to Bravo, 1 run","goes or a biggish swing first ball outside off, into the covers for one"
17.5,"Anderson to Rayudu, 1 run, OUT","Rayudu can't make it despite the dive! He steered it to short third man where Umesh dived to his right but the ball deflected away, making the batsmen think of two. But it wasn't too far and Umesh qickly got back and, guess what, direct hit at the keeper's end"
17.4,"Anderson to Rayudu, FOUR runs","too much room to free the arms, too short to give the batsman enough time and Rayudu gets on top of that to slap it between point and cover"
17.3,"Anderson to Dhoni, 1 run",wider from the batsman and Dhoni pushes it into off for one
17.2,"Anderson to Dhoni, SIX runs","over the sightscreen to bring up his half-century! Too full and straight after that wide, Dhoni's high back lift was waiting and he didn't even have to finish the follow through to hammer that"
17.2,"Anderson to Dhoni, 1 wide",tries to bowl it well away and ends up giving a wide on off
17.1,"Anderson to Rayudu, 1 run","short and wide going across, slapped over the covers for one"
16.6,"Siraj to Dhoni, FOUR runs","he has found the gap and the boundary we didn't see! In the channel outside off, Dhoni hung back and cut it late enough to bisect backward point and short third man. They didn't even move"
16.5,"Siraj to Rayudu, 1 run","short and slow outside off, Rayudu goes on his toes and lofts it over the covers for two more"
16.4,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 run","good line just outside off, helps it to short third man for one"
16.3,"Siraj to Dhoni, 2 runs","pitched up with some room and Dhoni has cleverly driven that square, almost beating the fielder. De Grandhomme runs across to his left behind square and slides to just keep the ball in. The third umpire is checking and looks fine"
16.2,"Siraj to Rayudu, 1 run","almost in the block hole, Rayudu slams it down to long off"
16.1,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 run","short of length outside off, dabbed to third man for one"
15.6,"Anderson to Rayudu, SIX runs","that's better from Rayudu, that's a six on any ground! Walked across for the length ball and clubbed it away into the cheering crowd over deep midwicket for his eighth six"
15.5,"Anderson to Rayudu, SIX runs","these boundaries are so short, that's another six over the covers! Short again outside off and Rayudu stayed still until slapping that flat and well over the covers"
15.5,"Anderson to Rayudu, 1 wide","short and wide outside off as Rayudu swings, misses and it's called a wide even though Anderson thinks it's not"
15.4,"Anderson to Dhoni, 1 run","short outside off, upper cut to third man after a bounce"
15.3,"Anderson to Rayudu, 1 run","dropped! Leading edge and Umesh has put it down. Rayudu went for the big shot from outside off, he didn't get close to it and that went so high Umesh had all the time in the world to get under it. He got under it in the cricle on the off side but it popped out"
15.2,"Anderson to Rayudu, no run","slightly slower and angled across from well outside off, he swings and misses"
15.1,"Anderson to Dhoni, 1 run","smashes the full delivery down the ground, Kohli sprints across to his right from long off and sends back a powerful throw to keep it to one. Both captains giving it their everything"
14.6,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 run","good delivery on the off stump, Dhoni pushes for a single as soon as he helps it to mid off"
14.5,"Siraj to Dhoni, no run","length delivery just outside off, Dhoni waits and then defends"
14.4,"Siraj to Rayudu, 1 run",stays back in the crease and bunts it down to long on
14.3,"Siraj to Rayudu, SIX runs","over the covers and six, Rayudu's sixth six! He charged down the track and didn't look like he middled it, but he got enough to send it flat and over"
14.2,"Siraj to Rayudu, no run","slower short ball well outside off, Rayudu lets it go but it's not a wide"
14.1,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 run","shot and wide outside off, he reaches out and tucks it over point"
13.6,"Negi to Rayudu, no run",better line from Negi - wider outside off as Rayudu tries to sweep but it's out of his reach outside off
13.5,"Negi to Rayudu, SIX runs","it's Rayudu's turn, he's sent that over the cow corner! Short enough from Negi for Rayudu to go back quickly and pull that to the leg side. It's a short boundary and they're making full use of it"
13.4,"Negi to Dhoni, 1 run",looks to come forward but then goes back and cuts with a thick outside edge after the turn to short third man
13.3,"Negi to Dhoni, no run","changes the line to pitch it outside off, brings it shorter too and it turns to beat Dhoni"
13.2,"Negi to Dhoni, SIX runs","one more, not a drop of sweat and that's gone over long on! Another fullish delivery from Negi, on the stumps and right in the zone for Dhoni to hit it straight"
13.1,"Negi to Dhoni, SIX runs","here comes the golf swing! Pitched up on off and Dhoni is not going to leave those, quick hands, strong bottom hand and all the power from those arms and shoulders launches that over the sight screen"
12.6,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 run",better line from Chahal as Dhoni drives that with turn into the covers
12.6,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 wide",this one is a wide was it turns and goes wider than the line
12.5,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","flatter one on the pads, gets one to the leg side with a thick inside edge"
12.4,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run","slow and well outside off, turns away further and Rayudu leaves, thinking it's a wide. But it's not"
12.3,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 run",lofts it down the ground and reaches long on after a bounce. Risky shot for a single
12.2,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","slightly slower and full on middle and leg, chips it bit in the air and down to long on"
12.1,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 leg bye",towards the pads and it's worked fine for a single
11.6,"Anderson to Dhoni, 1 run",pitched up slightly and he helps it down to long off
11.5,"Anderson to Dhoni, SIX runs","into the open sky and into the stands! Pitched up slightly in Dhoni's arc, he picked the length and smoked it over long on. Hit it so hard, I wouldn't have tried to catch it"
11.4,"Anderson to Rayudu, 1 leg bye","Anderson appeals loudly for lbw as Rayudu goes down on a knee to sweep that to the leg side but misses it. Not given as runs and Kohli reviews it. It hit Rayudu around his waist but height may not be a problem, did it pitch in line? Pitches in line, and that has actually gone past and over stump so RCB lose a review."
11.3,"Anderson to Dhoni, 1 run","not too far from the off stump, Dhoni stays back and punches it to long off"
11.2,"Anderson to Rayudu, 1 run","a cutter at 120kmh on leg stump, Rayudu guides it into the off side"
11.1,"Anderson to Dhoni, 1 run",enough room outside off for Dhoni to drive it away to deep point
10.6,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run","goes for a big sweep but Chahal has smartly bowled it slow and Rayudu is through with the shot already, goes on to hit the stumps but doesn't matter"
10.6,"Chahal to Rayudu, (no ball)","flat googly towards the stumps and Rayudu defends it back. Oh, no ball for overstepping. Ouch, harsh call from the umpire, Long"
10.5,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 run","touch fuller and towards leg, helped towards square leg for one"
10.4,"Chahal to Dhoni, no run","nicely flighted on middle and leg, Dhoni waits and helps it straight to midwicket"
10.3,"Chahal to Dhoni, 2 runs","soft hands from Dhoni to work that to the leg side from leg stump, they run hard and make it back for two"
10.2,"Chahal to Dhoni, 2 runs",towards the leg side and Dhoni covers his stumps to paddle that down and fine on the leg side before the fielder there dives to his right to save two
10.1,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","turning towards off from middle, Rayudu goes back and turns it to leg"
9.6,"Negi to Dhoni, no run","nicely bowled on the stumps, around middle and leg and it turned enough to make Dhoni defend it back. No room whatsoever"
9.5,"Negi to Rayudu, 1 run",takes a step down and pushes the ball with the turn to long off
9.4,"Negi to Dhoni, 1 run",charges down again to take it on the full and slams it to long on
9.3,"Negi to Dhoni, SIX runs","launches it over the leg side, he's not wasting time today! Took a step down as soon as he saw the ball was on leg, reached the pitch of the ball and sent it over deep midwicket"
9.2,"Negi to Dhoni, no run","targets the stumps with the angle, Dhoni pushes it straight back"
9.1,"Negi to Rayudu, 1 run",towards the pads from Negi and Rayudu works it against the spin to leg
8.6,"Chahal to Jadeja, OUT","so much turn, he's got the off stump! After that wide, Chahal goes wide outside off, wide enough to tempt Jadeja into a cut and he tries that but it turns in viciously to knock the stumps over!"
8.6,"Chahal to Jadeja, 1 wide",turns from middle and leg and goes down leg for a wide
8.5,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run",pitched up this time so he drives it down to long off easily
8.4,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run",beaten! Rayudu stays back to let the ball turn and it turns so much that beats his outside edge
8.3,"Chahal to Rayudu, SIX runs","goes inside out again with the turn, and this time he has middled it with the turn. It's gone high and over deep cover all the way"
8.2,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run","goes for the drive but it's a touch slower and doesn't turn that much, inside edge back to the bowler"
8.1,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run","keeps low, loud appeal turned down quickly! It was short and quick, Rayudu pulled and missed but was struck outside leg"
7.6,"Yadav to Rayudu, 1 run","stifling line around off again, he goes across a bit on his toes and helps it to leg for one"
7.5,"Yadav to Jadeja, 1 run","short and towards Jadeja's waist, works it away easily or one more"
7.4,"Yadav to Rayudu, 1 run","back of length and coming in again, tucked to leg off his toes"
7.3,"Yadav to Jadeja, 1 run",dances down and smacks the ball from outside off to deep point. A fielder is stationed there
7.2,"Yadav to Jadeja, no run","swings it into him from middle stump, no room for Jadeja to put it away"
7.1,"Yadav to Rayudu, 1 run","pretty straight and coming into the batsman, he defends to leg for one"
6.6,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run",brings the length shorter and the ball doesn't bounce much but Rayudu stays back to whip it to leg
6.5,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run","flatter on the pads, Rayudu pushes it to the right of Chahal and the bowler sprints across quickly"
6.4,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run","lunges forward a bit for the length ball on the stumps, blocks it"
6.3,"Chahal to Jadeja, 1 run","turns into him a fair bit from outside off, Jadeja tucks it to leg off the back foot"
6.2,"Chahal to Billings, OUT","lots of turn and he's stumped! Billings came down the track, Chahal bowls it slower through the air and shorter on the stumps, Billings looks to flick it with the wrists but the ball turns so much that it's gone past him and into the keeper's gloves"
6.1,"Chahal to Billings, FOUR runs",plants his foot across and paddles it fine against the turn and it's gone really fine to beat the fielder
5.6,"Yadav to Billings, 1 run","just outside the off stump, he steers it down to third man"
5.5,"Yadav to Billings, no run","straighter on the off stump, solid defence from Billings this time"
5.4,"Yadav to Billings, no run","wow! Goes through Billings, just misses off stump and de Kock takes it near his shoulders. That swung in late from back of length around off, Billins presented the staright bat but on the wrong line"
5.3,"Yadav to Billings, FOUR runs","on the pads again, his time Billings flicks it properly and over midwicket to clear the fielders for four"
5.2,"Yadav to Billings, no run","loud appeal  first ball for Billings, but it's going down leg, the excitement for RCB makes it a loud appeal. It was angling in and going down for sure"
5.1,"Yadav to Raina, OUT","the persistence with pace pays off, Raina miscues it to backward point! Raina strayed from his stumps again and Umesh pitched it up with some swing towards his legs, Raina flicked but mistimed it horrible and the edge went the other way, easy peasy for Mandeep"
4.6,"Siraj to Rayudu, FOUR runs",the umpire ducks as Rayudu charges down and slaps the short of length ball over the bowler's head with sheer disdain. He's looking in ominuous form
4.5,"Siraj to Raina, 1 run","angled into him this time, worked to the leg side more easily for one"
4.4,"Siraj to Raina, FOUR runs","in the air and right in the gap on the off side, he gets four too! Raina backed away again for the short ball and slayed that ball right between extra cover and cover point"
4.4,"Siraj to Raina, 1 wide",goes towards the off stump and Siraj strays down leg for a wide
4.3,"Siraj to Rayudu, 1 run","quick and nipping into Rayudu, just about gets his bat down for one towards point. Think he got glove actually"
4.2,"Siraj to Rayudu, FOUR runs",pulled to midwicket for a one-bounce four! He went to the off stump early to predict the slightly short ball and then swivelled on the back foot to pull it in the vacant area
4.1,"Siraj to Rayudu, no run","starts with a short ball outside off, Rayudu gets over the ball in the nick of time to defend"
3.6,"Yadav to Raina, no run",goes through him! Umesh cranking it up and bowling short to Raina even as he's making room to target the off side. This time the ball swings into him and he can't get any bat on that
3.5,"Yadav to Raina, FOUR runs","short ball for Raina, he makes plenty of room and pulls that just wide of mid on and in the gap for four"
3.4,"Yadav to Rayudu, 1 run","hint of swing away from outside off, he dabs it late to third man for one"
3.3,"Yadav to Rayudu, no run","cramps him for room with a short ball towards the ribs, good comeback from Umesh. Made Rayudu uncomfortable as he brought his bat down just in time"
3.2,"Yadav to Rayudu, no run","short, wide and swinging away, he cuts and misses"
3.1,"Yadav to Rayudu, SIX runs",strays towards the pads and Rayudu won't let that go. Uses his wrists and flicks it off the middle to the long leg boundary. Goes all the way!
2.6,"Sundar to Rayudu, 1 run","quick again aorund off, worked to the leg side and he keeps strike"
2.5,"Sundar to Rayudu, no run","flat and quick outside off, he pushes it back to the bowler"
2.4,"Sundar to Rayudu, SIX runs","more elegant this time, pitched up and Rayudu stays still to drive that nicely down the ground with a big swing. Pressure on bowler now"
2.3,"Sundar to Rayudu, SIX runs","flat and short at 99.6 kmh, Rayudu dances down and clobbers that over deep midwicket. He's broken the shackles"
2.2,"Sundar to Rayudu, no run","pretty straight outside off, Rayudu dabs it to cover point"
2.1,"Sundar to Raina, 1 run","around length outside off, tickled to the leg side with the angle"
1.6,"Yadav to Raina, 1 run","here comes the short ball, not a bouncer, and Raina taps it with a horizontal bat to midwicket"
1.5,"Yadav to Raina, no run","138kmh and Raina had no clue about that! What a beautiful length delivery from Umesh, in the channel outside off, Raina doesn't know whether to go back or forward, drives and misses"
1.4,"Yadav to Raina, no run",it's angled away outside off and Raina dabs it tentatively to point
1.3,"Yadav to Rayudu, 1 run","risky single the one as Umesh's short of length ball squared up Rayudu a bit, he defended it off the back foot towards cover and Raina made it just in time"
1.2,"Yadav to Rayudu, no run","taps the back of length delivery from outside off to Negi at point again, the crowd showes how much they love him"
1.1,"Yadav to Rayudu, no run",swings it away from length as Rayudu helps it towards backward point where Negi puts in a dive
0.6,"Negi to Watson, OUT","caught at mid-on, Negi has struck! Wasn't the short on the stumps but Watson went back to pull and miscued it, easy catch for mid-on"
0.5,"Negi to Watson, SIX runs",high and long! Lunges forward for the length delivery and gets under the ball really well to send that flying over long on. Negi shut his eyes as soon as Watson launched it
0.4,"Negi to Watson, no run",bit too short and Watson pulls but miscues it to backward square leg
0.3,"Negi to Rayudu, 1 run",comes down now and pushes the ball down the ground with the spin to mid off
0.2,"Negi to Rayudu, no run",leans forward for the length delivery and defends solidly
0.1,"Negi to Watson, 1 run",starts with a full delivery and Watson drives it down to long off
19.6,"Bravo to Sundar, FOUR runs","you beauty. Sundar with some aggressive sensibility! Shows the older boys how it's done. Stands his ground once again, allows the bowler to bowl to him and reacts to find a boundary through point. It's a poor ball - short and wide, and he carves it expertly"
19.5,"Bravo to Sundar, 2 runs",shot. That'll bring up 200. It's a full toss on off stump and he gets under it to punch straight over the umpire
19.4,"Bravo to Sundar, SIX runs","smash. Sundar with a reminder that there's some batting left. Hangs deep in the crease, gets a short ball that is also a slower ball. Plenty of time to swing and he manages to lift it over deep midwicket. That's a Chinnaswamy sixer"
19.3,"Bravo to Yadav, OUT","bye bye. Bizarre over. Bizarre cricket. A slower ball at length outside off. Umesh looks to slug it to Commercial Street. He can only find Billings, 20 yards in from the boundary at deep midwicket"
19.3,"Bravo to Yadav, 1 wide",almost another run-out. Royal Challengers trying hard to get bowled out. A full toss - wide down leg side. He's got a free run but he's skipping outside the crease for some reason. Dhoni misses both the stumps and the batsman narrowly with his throw
19.2,"Bravo to Sundar, 1 run, OUT","and another! Well, scratch that about momentum. Three wickets in three balls. Two run outs. Quite appalling. It's a full toss and he lifts it inside-out to long-off's right. Jadeja picks up on the bounce. Sundar has settled into the crease at the non-striker's end. Negi is running down frantically though for some reason. Turns, slips, can't make his ground at the striker's end"
19.1,"Bravo to Negi, OUT",Dhoni hits and that's Colin de Grandhomme. And the associated runs. Too simple for him - he chucks it overarm with his glove one. Negi was looking to dab this slower ball past him with a late cut and missed
18.6,"Thakur to Mandeep, OUT","taken at deep midwicket. Mandeep picks the knuckle ball, but this length ball is too far outside off for the slog sweep he plays eventually. Ends up slicing it and Jadeja has an easy one. This is a good innings from Mandeep, he has put the momentum back in RCB's favour"
18.6,"Thakur to Mandeep, 1 wide",full and very very wide outside off. No chance he'll hit that
18.5,"Thakur to Mandeep, SIX runs","shot! This is Mandeep's arrival. It's taken some time. Stunning hit. A knuckle ball dug in short outside off. No pace off the pitch but somehow he has pummelled this, one the up, with a flat bat over long-off"
18.5,"Thakur to Mandeep, 1 wide",he shapes to jump into the leg side for a ramp and withdraws late. The bowler is forced to bowl wide outside off and he leaves to get the extra run
18.4,"Thakur to Mandeep, 2 runs","slower ball dropped short outside off, reaches out and flat-bats it past the non-striker. Calls for two immediately and they do well to get back"
18.3,"Thakur to Grandhomme, 1 run","yorker outside off, jams it to long-off off the toe-end"
18.2,"Thakur to Mandeep, 1 run","dabbed between the two sweepers on the off side. He was looking to get down for the ramp over short fine, but it's a slower ball short and wide outside off. Stabs it out there."
18.1,"Thakur to Mandeep, SIX runs",sweetly timed! Mandeep Singh with a top-class shot. It's a length ball wide outside off and he gets his weight down on his back thigh as he reaches out and uses his wrists nicely to slice it over point
17.6,"Bravo to Grandhomme, FOUR runs",in the block hole but de Grandhomme lofts it back over the fielder and even beats long off for a four. What a shot!
17.5,"Bravo to Grandhomme, 2 runs",moves across and whips the slow and low full toss to long leg. Chahar is stationed there but de Grandhomme comes back and throws in a dive as the throw comes wide
17.4,"Bravo to Mandeep, 1 run",smacks it back to Bravo who sticks his left hand out couldn't hold on to it. It will count as a drop but was struck really hard
17.3,"Bravo to Mandeep, no run","length delivery this time at 135kmh, it doesn't bounce much and Mandeep slogs but misses again"
17.2,"Bravo to Mandeep, no run","slow bouncer, it beats Mandeep completely. Can't get close"
17.1,"Bravo to Mandeep, 2 runs","slow yorker outside off, gets some bat and Dhoni dives to stop, he has a shy at the stumps closer to him and the batsman is nowhere close, he misses and then they take one on overthrow too"
16.6,"Tahir to Grandhomme, 2 runs","yorks de Grandhomme, who bunts the ball to the right of long on where Bravo chases and throws it back and Mandeep makes it with a dive just in time"
16.5,"Tahir to Mandeep, 1 run",pitched up and Mandeep uses his wrists to whip it to long on
16.4,"Tahir to Grandhomme, 1 run",drives it with the turn into the covers where a fumble allows one
16.3,"Tahir to Mandeep, 1 run","quick and flat outside off, he taps it late and calls for the single quickly"
16.2,"Tahir to Grandhomme, 1 run","some flight there outside off, de Grandhomme waits and drives to sweeper cover"
16.1,"Tahir to Mandeep, 1 run",short ball on leg and it's pulled to deep midwicket
15.6,"Jadeja to Grandhomme, no run","beaten first ball outside off, he tried to defend the length ball but it turned again and missed the bat and off stump, both"
15.5,"Jadeja to Mandeep, 1 run","lots of turn outside off, Mandeep stretches out to tap it through the covers"
15.4,"Jadeja to Mandeep, FOUR runs",he takes out the reverse sweep now for the ball on off stump. Fine leg was in and all he had to do was clear that fielder
15.3,"Jadeja to Mandeep, SIX runs","sweeps it with some power against the turn, Billings throws himself to his right with a giant leap at deep midwicket and just misses it"
15.2,"Jadeja to Mandeep, no run","beats him outside off with the turn again, turns him square"
15.1,"Jadeja to Mandeep, 4 byes","that turn beats the batsman and Dhoni! It pitched on leg stump, maybe even outside, Mandeep looked to work it to leg and that turned a mile to miss the off stump while Mandeep came out of the crease and Dhoni missed the ball too"
14.6,"Tahir to Anderson, OUT","two in two, Tahir is running again! Anderson got strike because they crossed over on the previous delivery, Tahir sent down a wrong'un outside off and Anderson poked tentatively to slip where Harbhajan pouched it"
14.5,"Tahir to AB, OUT","AB holes out, another great over for CSK. Not a great delivery, it was a short legbreak well outside off and turned away further but AB swung away from the body and the leading edge went high enough for Billings to run in from sweeper cover. He doesn't drop those"
14.4,"Tahir to Anderson, 1 run",takes a step down to make it a full delivery and drives it hard to long on
14.3,"Tahir to AB, 1 run",sweeps against the turn and along the ground to long leg
14.2,"Tahir to Anderson, 1 run","pretty short and Anderson miscues it down the ground, lands short of long on"
14.1,"Tahir to AB, 1 run",enough room outside off to drive that powerfully along the ground through the covers
13.6,"Bravo to Anderson, no run","he charges a bit after those five dot balls, Bravo is smart enough to land that wide and away from him, another dot"
13.5,"Bravo to Anderson, no run","outside off, yorker again and Anderson chops it to backward point"
13.4,"Bravo to Anderson, no run","big lbw appeal from Bravo, it was a really really slow yorker and beat Anderson completely, hitting him near the knee on the back foot. Looks like Dhoni didn't want to review"
13.3,"Bravo to Anderson, no run",nearly a yorker outside off and it's steered to point where Raina puts in a dive
13.2,"Bravo to Anderson, no run",starts with a bouncer to Anderson and he lets it go outside off
13.1,"Bravo to de Kock, OUT","oh, he's broken this stand with a good return catch! It was a typical Bravo slower ball, back of length on the stumps and de Kock pulled but a bit too early and handed it back to the bowler, who brings out his dance celebration and the crowd loves it"
12.6,"Thakur to AB, no run","really slow bouncer on middle and it's angled it, AB sways his head out of the line and tries a kind of ramp but misses"
12.5,"Thakur to de Kock, 1 run","gets room to free his arms and he does, along the ground to deep point"
12.4,"Thakur to AB, 1 run","goes back and across, good reply from Thakur with a yorker outside off near the feet and AB drives it bit wide of long on"
12.3,"Thakur to AB, SIX runs","three in a row! Outside off now, bit too full and big swing of the arms to send that flying over the covers. The fielders can call for chairs now"
12.2,"Thakur to AB, SIX runs","here comes the knuckleball, here comes another six! It was too full, that's what was wrong with it, AB spotted the speed variation and tonked it straight down the ground"
12.1,"Thakur to AB, SIX runs","launched into the sky and that's fifty for him too! It lands in the crowd beyond the midwicket fence. It wans't full or too short, but those things don't matter to AB"
11.6,"Watson to de Kock, SIX runs","not that short, but what a shot! Just a tad short, de Kock stays back and still and then smokes it over the midwicket boundary. That's gone a long, long way!"
11.5,"Watson to de Kock, no run","wide yorker to de Kock as he makes room and then stretches to reach out for it, can't get there"
11.4,"Watson to AB, 1 run","top edge, where does it land? Just before long on who runs in a long way from the boundary. What luck for AB. He pulled the short ball and didn't get enough"
11.3,"Watson to de Kock, 1 run","makes room and it's slower again, heaves it to the leg side for one"
11.2,"Watson to de Kock, 2 runs",tries the wide yorker and de Kock paddles it from so far to the leg side
11.1,"Watson to AB, 1 run","length delivery at 123kmh outside off, big swing and AB gets it to long on for one"
11.1,"Watson to AB, 1 wide",wide signalled by Nigel Long as this one is full and wide outside off. Watson lets out a smile
10.6,"Tahir to de Kock, 2 runs","slower through the air on leg, de Kock works it with the spin to leg with soft hands so that they take two even though Dhoni chases it all the way"
10.5,"Tahir to AB, 1 run",stays back and across in the crease and works that after it turns to leg
10.4,"Tahir to AB, SIX runs","that's out of the stadium! He walks across to expose his stumps, it's a length delivery, although it doesn't matter to this man, and he clobbers that over long on, over the stands and over everything. Someone fetch that as AB grabs a drink"
10.3,"Tahir to AB, SIX runs","goes the other side this time, six more! Plants his front foot across and sweeps that against the turn from length over long leg into the crowd"
10.2,"Tahir to AB, no run","poor delivery - short and turning away, AB makes room and misses it"
10.1,"Tahir to AB, FOUR runs","just outside off and AB gets a reverse sweep on that one, no power only guides it fine and gets four"
9.6,"Bravo to AB, 1 run",goes across early and scoops it over the in-field behind square. Didn't get much distance but got two
9.5,"Bravo to de Kock, 1 run","in the block hole yet again, what accuracy. De Kock bunts it a bit wide of point and takes off, Raina has a shy at the stumps and misses while AB makes it"
9.4,"Bravo to de Kock, 2 runs","in the block hole on the of stump, de Kock does well to steer it to deep point and they get two for that. The stand reaches 50"
9.3,"Bravo to de Kock, no run","yorks him for the second time in three balls, got it across with the angle too and de Kock misses again. Bravo thought he got some bat"
9.2,"Bravo to de Kock, SIX runs","slower ball at 101kph, but it's too full and de Kock slams it straight and over the bowler's head for a clean six! Big stride and big bat swing"
9.1,"Bravo to de Kock, no run",starts with a wide yorker which de Kock can't get bat on
8.6,"Tahir to AB, 2 runs","on the middle stump, AB plonks his front foot across and goes for the big sweep. Thakur runs to his right at long leg and just about keeps it in, almost over-running in the deep"
8.5,"Tahir to de Kock, 1 run","goes for the big slog sweep, it was slightly full, but he gets an inside edge to the leg side"
8.4,"Tahir to de Kock, no run","makes room and charges, Tahir yorks him and de Kock bunts it to cover point"
8.3,"Tahir to AB, 1 run",little full and AB drives it down to long off for one
8.2,"Tahir to de Kock, 1 run","bit more orthodox this time, worked with the spin to the leg side"
8.1,"Tahir to de Kock, no run","pitches this one leg stump, de Kock tries the reverse sweep and misses it completely. That wasn't far from the leg stump"
7.6,"Watson to de Kock, 1 run",tried the yorker but de Kock came down and turned it into a low full toss to work it down to long on for one
7.5,"Watson to AB, 1 run","offcutter at 123kmh, he spots it and cuts off the back foot to deep point for one"
7.4,"Watson to de Kock, 1 run",at 122.2 kmh this time and de Kock comes down to slam it to sweeper cover for one
7.3,"Watson to de Kock, no run","slower at 128.4kmh, the speed variation beats the batsman outside off as he cuts again and misses"
7.2,"Watson to de Kock, FOUR runs","angles it across, there's not much room but de Kock cuts that nicely off the back foot and bisects the gap between point and short third man. Not a bad ball, but really good shot"
7.1,"Watson to de Kock, 2 runs","starts with a slow off cutter on middle and leg, de Kock nudges it to leg and they took a single at normal pace and realised no fielder was sprinting in on the ball so take one more. Plenty of 30-plus players in CSK"
6.6,"Jadeja to de Kock, 1 run","swept yet again, Tahir has to run to his left from long leg and keeps it inside the boundary"
6.5,"Jadeja to de Kock, 2 runs","works it with the spin from around off, it's between two fielders and they get two quick runs"
6.4,"Jadeja to AB, 1 run","stays still, it's outside off and drives it along the ground to sweeper cover for one"
6.3,"Jadeja to AB, SIX runs","plants his front foot across and he sweeps that behind square for a six once again, the bowler doens't matter to this man"
6.2,"Jadeja to de Kock, 1 run",sweeps successfully this time to fine leg
6.1,"Jadeja to de Kock, no run","takes a step down and tries to work it with the spin, stifled appeal for lbw"
5.6,"Harbhajan to AB, no run","makes room, Harbhajan sends it slower and AB waits to defend it back. Loud cheers for that too"
5.5,"Harbhajan to AB, FOUR runs","makes room yet again and gets enough of it to free his arms again to slam that square of the wicket for four this time. The length is not that bad, but this batsman isn't bad either"
5.4,"Harbhajan to AB, SIX runs","woah, a flat six over the covers! It was pitched up, no doubt and AB smoked that over the covers like he knew where that was coming and at what speed. What a shot!"
5.3,"Harbhajan to AB, no run",tickles it with the turn to the midwicket fielder
5.2,"Harbhajan to AB, SIX runs","he comes down and that lands into the crowd over long on! A bit of light, he absolutely middled that fearliesslly because long on was there and it sailed over him"
5.1,"Harbhajan to de Kock, 1 run","some flight outside off and de Kock wants to whack it, but only gets a single down to long off"
4.6,"Thakur to AB, no run","on the off side this time, AB steers it late to short third man"
4.5,"Thakur to AB, no run","heaves and misses! Short of length and swinging in a bit late, he goes for the mighty pull and the ball goes just under the bat"
4.4,"Thakur to AB, no run","another good delivery, straight and on length. AB stays still and punches it back, just evading the bowler but they decide against the single because Jadeja is there"
4.3,"Thakur to AB, no run","straight delivery served first up to ABD, he pushes it back"
4.2,"Thakur to Kohli, OUT","Jadeja dives and takes it at mid-on. Kohli walked down this time, it was a length delivery on the stumps and Kohli wanted to loft it over the fielder but didn't quite middle it. Jadeja was slightly wide at mid-on and he quicklt went to his left for a dive and grabbed it with both hands. Thakur is thrilled!"
4.1,"Thakur to Kohli, no run","angles this length delivery into the pads, no swing and Kohli works it to midwicket"
3.6,"Harbhajan to de Kock, no run","little flatter, de Kock goes hard at it outside off but doesn't quite middle it"
3.5,"Harbhajan to de Kock, SIX runs",dances down this time and doesn't let the ball turn from off stump. Middles that and hits it against the turn with a big follow through over long on
3.4,"Harbhajan to de Kock, no run","flight and room again, he frees his arms to cut this time, there's some bounce too and he finds the fielder again"
3.3,"Harbhajan to de Kock, no run","some room outside off, he goes after it and drives it along the ground to cover"
3.2,"Harbhajan to Kohli, 1 run","bit of flight and it's pitched up a bit, Kohli helps it down to long on this time"
3.1,"Harbhajan to Kohli, no run","pitched up around off, Kohli comes forward and drives it back"
2.6,"Chahar to Kohli, 1 run","walks down the pitch and Chahar bowls it short outside off, not much room so Kohli dabs it square for a single"
2.5,"Chahar to Kohli, FOUR runs","another slower ball, it's full and Kohli picks it to flick it with those mighty wrists, it's going fast towards the midwicket boundary where Billing dives to keep it in, but the ball is rolling towards the boundary again and we have the third umpire looking at it. Looks like Billings' fingers touched the boundary when he tried to keep it in for the second time"
2.4,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 run","makes some room this time, it's a slower ball and he patiently pushes it into off for one"
2.3,"Chahar to de Kock, SIX runs","smokes it for six this time! Bit fuller, de Kock leans into it and slams that over the long-on boundary with the inswing"
2.2,"Chahar to de Kock, 2 runs","top edge, it goes really really high and just avoids Dhoni who runs back all the way and then flicks the ball inside the boundary to save two. De Kock pulled the short ball and his heart must have been in his mouth after that went high, but it went back over the keeper"
2.1,"Chahar to Kohli, 1 run",back of length again and tapped to point by Kohli again for one more single
1.6,"Thakur to Kohli, 1 run",taps the back of length ball outside off nicely and steals a single to keep strike
1.5,"Thakur to Kohli, no run","he pitches it a touch shorter, Kohli waits and steers to cover point patiently"
1.4,"Thakur to Kohli, 2 runs","still too full, Kohli drives along the ground this time through the covers and gets two"
1.3,"Thakur to Kohli, FOUR runs","the crowd loves it! Because this is pitched up, there's some outswing and there's Kohli driving that over mid off beautifully from the middle of the bat"
1.2,"Thakur to de Kock, 1 run","walks down the track this time, Thakur sends it down towards the pads and he gets an inside edge behind square on the leg side"
1.1,"Thakur to de Kock, no run","too full outside off and some swing for him too, de Kock reaches out to drive but doesn't middle it"
0.6,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","back of length outside off, Kohli hangs back and punches it to cover"
0.5,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","brings it touch shorter now and much straighter with that outswing, Kohli defends it back"
0.4,"Chahar to Kohli, FOUR runs",bit too full on middle and leg and Kohli flicks it away almost nonchalantly over midwicket for a cracking four. Excellent timing
0.3,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","pitches it short to Kohli and gets some away movement, Kohli stays back and defends it to the leg side"
0.2,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 run","nice inswing this time from outside off and on good length, de Lock punches it towards mid off and gets off the mark"
0.1,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","slightly full outside off and not much swing, QdK reaches out and steers it to cover point"
18.5,"Basil to Mustafizur, OUT","is that it? Yes it is! Deepak Hooda not in the XI today, but he has the opportunity to be on the field for a very, very famous moment. Gets under it at midwicket and completes a catch. Mustafiz looks to pull and gets it off the high part of the bat. A slice - no danger. Mumbai's innings was no danger, to be fair. A feeble end but a fitting one"
18.4,"Basil to Bumrah, 1 run",bunts one over the non-striker as he backs away to slog. Thampi just too quick off the surface for these two
18.3,"Basil to Bumrah, no run",short of a length ball in the corridor. Swipes from under it and can't connect
18.2,"Basil to Mustafizur, 1 run",chipped wide of midwicket as he looks to pull. Length ball is too quick as it angles into him
18.1,"Basil to Mustafizur, no run",length ball in the corridor. He backs away to try and lift it over extra cover. Beaten
17.6,"Kaul to Bumrah, no run",inside edge it appears. Length ball outside off. Gets on his back knee and looks to drive but this ends up with the keeper
17.5,"Kaul to Bumrah, FOUR runs","oh there's life here still. Just about. Short of a length ball in at the hips. Bumrah swings cleanly and connects to drag this to fine leg's left. The slide won't help, it's four"
17.4,"Kaul to Pandya, OUT","aims midwicket again and that's curtains! Hardik Pandya has sliced one to third man! Same line and length three balls in a row, same shot offered with no result. You've got to question that strategy. But it's also superb bowling from Kaul. He has now picked up three wickets in under two overs. 3 off 19 balls for Pandya. This will be tough to get over. Mumbai on the verge of a stunning defeat."
17.3,"Kaul to Pandya, no run","misses again! Looks to go leg side again. Short of a length ball outside off and it's too quick again. There are gaps over extra cover and mid-off, but he's aiming midwicket right now"
17.2,"Kaul to Pandya, no run","looks to swat it away but he's beaten by pace. You won't spot any faces at Wankhede, they are all covered with nervous palms. Short of a length ""heavy ball"" outside off shoots past the attempted slog"
17.1,"Kaul to Bumrah, 1 run",Dhawan flies to his right and can't hold on! Oh what a catch that would have been! Kaul gets it to rise in the corridor and Bumrah fends at it with hard hands. It is sailing high and very wide of Dhawan at wide slip. He does superbly to even reach it. But can only parry it to third man
16.6,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run",maiden. Hardik fails to get off strike. It's a length ball outside off. Looks like he wanted to tickle this through square leg but it spins away.
16.5,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","length ball at off stump, pushes it to point off the front foot"
16.4,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","length on leg stump, flicked straight to short fine. Refuses the run again"
16.3,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run",googly. Length ball outside off. Blocked solidly on the front foot
16.2,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","length ball outside off, stabs at it outside off and is beaten. Revs. Such revs."
16.1,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run",length ball outside off. Leans in to a drive to long-off. Refuses the run
15.6,"Kaul to Markande, OUT",plumb! Markande is gone! Kaul has put the fear truly into Wankhede now! It's a full ball on middle. Markande plants the front leg across and tries to flick behind square. He's not good enough to do that. There is no doubt in this one
15.5,"Kaul to Pandya, 1 leg bye",length on leg stump. Looks to flick but cops it on the thigh guard. Steals a single pitch side on the leg side
15.4,"Kaul to Pandya, no run","length just outside off, a tentative push to extra cover from the crease"
15.3,"Kaul to Markande, 1 run","length ball just outside off, steered to third man from the crease"
15.2,"Kaul to McClenaghan, OUT",he's given him! Mitch falls over as he tries to flick and is trapped right in front. Consults and reviews. Has that pitched outside leg? Looks like it's pitched in line yes it has! Dead. Right in front of middle. Mumbai are folding quickly now! They have lost their review.
15.1,"Kaul to Pandya, 1 run",short and in the corridor. Gets behind and dabs it to third man's left
14.6,"Basil to McClenaghan, no run",length ball just outside off. Tempts him to have a poke. He leaves it alone
14.5,"Basil to Yadav, OUT","picks out deep square! This is disastrous for Mumbai! It was an incredible shot -  a short arm whip off his hips at this length ball on leg stump. But he's launched it straight to the fielder there! Oh dear, this is getting tense Suryakumar has done superbly to keep reaasuring Mumbai so far. Now he's gone."
14.4,"Basil to Pandya, 1 run",run out chance missed. Shakib fails to pick up the ball at extra cover after running in. The batsmen are only just crossing over halfway down the pitch. Hardik dropped this pitch side with soft hands
14.3,"Basil to Pandya, no run","length on off stump, defended from the crease"
14.2,"Basil to Pandya, no run","length on leg stump, leans in and flicks straight to short midwicket"
14.1,"Basil to Yadav, 1 run","full on middle stump, sweetly timed drive to long-on"
13.6,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run",bounces past off stump! Rashid rips a googly in and Hardik is caught on the move as he looks to make room for a punch through cover. He can't do it. Under-edges int the turf and just survives
13.5,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","googly just outside off, defended on the front foot"
13.4,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, 1 run","full outside off. Goes too hard on the cover drive, gets it out to long-on off the inside half of the bat"
13.3,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, 1 run","ah, poor. Drops it very very short. Hardik taps to sweeper cover"
13.2,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run",length ball outside off. Zips off the surface as Pandya leaves. Saha does well to hold on
13.1,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, OUT","guides it to slip! Second batsman tonight to attempt a late cut with a slip in place. First to make connection. He's gone. Got to question that shot. It was a short slider outside off and he can't get it wide of Dhawan. That was travelling quickly, he did well to keep his balance"
12.6,"Shakib to Yadav, 2 runs","nicely played but some quality fielding out at long-on. Full ball on leg stump is drilled between long-on and deep midwicket. A slide to the right from long-on and a quick pick up and throw from deep midwicket, both of whom had to be inch perfect to avoid a collision"
12.5,"Shakib to Pollard, 1 run","length on leg stump, gets on the back foot and tickles it to long leg"
12.4,"Shakib to Yadav, 1 run","full on leg stump, clips to deep midwicket from the crease"
12.3,"Shakib to Pollard, 1 run","arm ball. Pushed through flat and Pollard has no clue about this. Looking to punch through cover, gets an inside edge to fine leg"
12.2,"Shakib to Pollard, SIX runs","see ya! Pollard's brief evident. Shakib goes loopy, he goes full, he goes leg stump. Pollard goes smash to send it over long-on"
12.1,"Shakib to Pollard, no run","good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, 1 run",Pandey leaps to his right at long-on after completely misjudging this. Pollard splices this off the inside half of the bat as he looks to slog the full one on leg stump
11.5,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, OUT","review. Lbw review. This back of a length ball rips into Krunal and beats him on the back foot punch. Hit him on the back leg. It's given not out. He's on the back foot, very deep in the crease it looks very out right now as we wait for the tracker. There's no edge on it .it's out! Decision will be overtuned. S Ravi gets a fairly straightforward one wrong. Krunal is gone, that's hitting middle and off."
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, no run","good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, FOUR runs","poor ball. Googly, short and wide outside off. Chopped away to the backward point boundary. Too easy"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, 1 run",dropped. Rashid's movement in his follow through has completely blinded him it seems. Length ball driven back at him and his hands are barely in place as it fizzes past him and goes to long-off
11.1,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, 1 run",juicy full toss on the pads. Punches it straight to deep midwicket
10.6,"Shakib to Krunal, 1 run",length ball pushed flat outside off. Flicked to long-on
10.5,"Shakib to Krunal, no run","good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
10.4,"Shakib to Krunal, no run",beaten in flight more by himself than the bowler. Steps out way too early and just manages to stab this length ball away outside off
10.3,"Shakib to Yadav, 1 run","tossed up on middle stump, flicked to long-on's right"
10.2,"Shakib to Yadav, no run","misses the arm ball and is struck on the back thigh as he looks to pull. Was very deep in the crease at the point of contact, but this was going down"
10.1,"Shakib to Krunal, 1 run","floated full on leg stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, 1 run","googly, back of a length outside off. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, 1 run",quicker one dropped very short. Gets away. Suryakumar hurried on the pull and can't get power to beat deep midwicket to his right
9.4,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, no run",googly. Tossed up outside off on a length. Defended off the under-edge
9.3,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, no run",beaten. Another googly. This one spinning into the corridor from back of a length. He goes for the late cut - even though a slip is there - and misses
9.2,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, no run","googly not picked. Suryakumar scythes at this length ball outside off, expecting it to turn away. Ends up chopping it past leg stump and straight to short fine"
9.1,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, no run","length ball pushed through just outside off, defended solidly on the front foot"
8.6,"Kaul to Krunal, FOUR runs","the batsman wins this battle. Kaul offers a full toss on off stump, Krunal probably smirks internally as he bludgeons this straight down the ground"
8.5,"Kaul to Krunal, FOUR runs",oh yes. What a contest this is. Krunal with the rebuttal so to speak. This is short of a length across the corridor and he gets on the back foot to swat this wide of mid-on
8.4,"Kaul to Krunal, no run",who needs swing? Kaul consigns Krunal to his backside. A sharp bouncer as he shuffles back and across. It's climbing up at his helmet and he quickly gets under it and can't hold his balance
8.3,"Kaul to Krunal, no run","length on off stump, punched to mid-on on the up"
8.2,"Kaul to Krunal, no run",well bowled. Bangs it into the corridor at a length and gets it to jag away. Krunal hangs the bat out and is beaten
8.1,"Kaul to Krunal, FOUR runs","glorious! Krunal with the shot of the evening. I said it might look different when Kaul bowls. Length ball skids on nicely outside off, no movement. He leans in, full balance and crunches a drive past mid-off"
7.6,"M Nabi to Yadav, 2 runs",so he whips one through midwicket. Nabi goes around the wicket and slants one across again but Suryakumar leans in and gets this between long-on and deep midwicket. Bit of a fumble out there as the two fielders converge
7.5,"M Nabi to Yadav, FOUR runs",shot! He's bringing out the class now. Makes room this time. He's greeted with a slider and he has plenty of pace as he shifts the weight back and punches it to the extra cover boundary
7.4,"M Nabi to Yadav, FOUR runs","nice. Very very nice. Hangs deep in the crease, anticipates the angle across him from around the wicket and waits before running this past short third man off the face"
7.3,"M Nabi to Krunal, 1 run","length on leg stump, nudged into the open midwicket region off the front foot"
7.2,"M Nabi to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length outside off, gets on the back foot and punches to sweeper cover"
7.1,"M Nabi to Yadav, no run","floated up at leg stump, drives towards long-on but can't get past midwicket"
6.6,"Kaul to Krunal, no run","good length outside off, looks to drive on the up but is beaten. Bat was well inside the line of that one"
6.5,"Kaul to Yadav, 1 run","well played, but Williamson gets across quickly at mid-off to keep it to a single. It's a length ball and he drives handsomely on the up"
6.4,"Kaul to Yadav, no run",full and a hint of late swing away. But he's behind this as he drives to mid-on
6.3,"Kaul to Krunal, 1 run","length outside off, uses the angle to jab towards third man"
6.2,"Kaul to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, whips to deep square off the back foot"
6.1,"Kaul to Krunal, 1 run","short of a length in the corridor, gets on top of the bounce and steers it to third man"
5.6,"Shakib to Yadav, no run","another arm ball that is just kept out. Sliding in at off stump and he just manages to block it, from very deep in the crease"
5.5,"Shakib to Yadav, no run",arm ball nearly sneaks past the inside edge. Suryakumar solid on the front foot though as he defends this
5.4,"Shakib to Yadav, no run","back of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
5.3,"Shakib to Krunal, 1 run","floated up at middle stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
5.2,"Shakib to Rohit Sharma, OUT","it's worked! Shakib lobs one up for Rohit and gets him to try and drive through cover. No feet whatsoever. It pitches and spins away, a hint of climb, and he's nowhere near the pitch of this. Easy one for Dhawan at slip"
5.1,"Shakib to Yadav, 1 run",floated up at middle stump and drilled off the front foot. Thampi tumbles to his left at mid-on to stop
4.6,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on middle stump, pushed to mid-on off the front foot"
4.5,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","shot. But intercepted by a couple of the cover fielder's fingers. It's a flowy back foot punch, chasing one outside off. Right off the middle but point chases it down and keeps it to two"
4.4,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","full at middle stump, defended into the leg side"
4.3,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","length outside off, leans into a drive but can't beat mid-off to his left"
4.2,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length just outside off, defended to point from the crease"
4.1,"Sandeep to Yadav, 1 run",short of a length and shaping into the corridor. Drags it to midwicket's right with a closed face
3.6,"M Nabi to Ishan, OUT","taken at long-off! Oh boy, is there a match here? Mumbai are trying hard to make one! Poor shot from Kishan. This is floated up at off stump, and he gets down the track. Beaten in flight and he ends up chipping and easy one for the fielder there as he tries to go inside-out"
3.5,"M Nabi to Ishan, no run","tossed up at off stump, defended into the covers off the front foot"
3.4,"M Nabi to Yadav, 1 run","length on leg stump, nudged to deep square off the front foot"
3.3,"M Nabi to Yadav, FOUR runs","through mid-off. Makes room this time and pummels this short of a length ball past the non-striker. Thampi is very late on his slide to the right and despite making his ground, allows this to pass"
3.2,"M Nabi to Yadav, no run",short of a length on middle stump. He shapes to punch through cover but has to adjust for the turn. Gets it to mid-on at the last moment
3.1,"M Nabi to Yadav, no run","short of a length on middle stump, punched to mid-off off the back foot"
2.6,"Sandeep to Ishan, no run",good length outswinger in the channel. Blocked solidly on the front foot
2.5,"Sandeep to Lewis, OUT","leading edge lobs up for point. This seems to be the worst delivery of the over on first glance. Full ball outside leg stump, not a lot of swing on it. Surely going wide if he doesn't attempt a shot, surely there for a tickle if he stays in the crease. But Lewis decides to walk down the pitch to cut out all the swing he's been seeing. Reaches out for it outside leg and is through the shot early. Easy take for Pandey"
2.4,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run","full awayswinger in the corridor, defended to point off the outside half"
2.3,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run",beats the outside edge and gets him on the back leg. Squares him up once again. This is not easy living for Lewis. Looking to tap that through midwicket and he's struck outside off on the back thigh
2.2,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run","good length outswinger, draws him forward - only half a stride complete - and forces him to feel for it. Beaten on the outside edge"
2.1,"Sandeep to Lewis, FOUR runs","short of a length outside off, more confidence than he's shown all innings on this occasion. Gets nicely behind and drills this through cover off the back foot"
1.6,"M Nabi to Yadav, no run","short of a length on middle stump, punched off the back foot, straight to mid-on"
1.5,"M Nabi to Yadav, no run","good length on middle stump, defended on the front foot"
1.4,"M Nabi to Yadav, no run","short of a length just outside off, punched to mid-off off the back foot"
1.3,"M Nabi to Lewis, 1 run",length ball fired in at the pads. Taps it wide of mid-on
1.2,"M Nabi to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, climbs on him as he dabs this uppishly into the leg side"
1.1,"M Nabi to Yadav, FOUR runs"," and he slants it across him, good length. Suryakumar doesn't have to do much. Stays tall in the crease and punches through cover"
0.6,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run","struck on the pad as he gets squared up. This looks very good actually, but no one interested. Did that pitch outside? He was looking to defend on the leg stump line and was completely lost as it hooped away"
0.5,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run",beaten by the awayswinger. Lewis looks to defend from the crease and it nowhere near this
0.4,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run","falls short of cover. Lewis gets in a weird position there. Almost like it's the first time he's encountering a swinging ball. This goes away outside off and he hangs his bat out at it, no control at all"
0.3,"Sandeep to Yadav, 1 run","some late swing in again. Plonks the front leg across and whips it to deep square. Risky shot, had to get bat on it"
0.2,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run","good length, swung in at middle stump. Gets behind the line and defends from the crease"
0.1,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run",inswinger rises from a good length at off stump. He fends it away as he trues to defend
0.1,"Sandeep to Yadav, 1 wide",inswinger on a good length. But it starts on middle and slides down
18.4,"Mustafizur to Pathan, OUT","smashed to deep midwicket! Picks out the fielder. A short delivery on off, swatted away to Hardik, who keeps his eyes on it and takes a good reverse-cupped catch. It's Sunrisers' second-lowest IPL total ever."
18.3,"Mustafizur to Pathan, SIX runs","he finally gets one away! A smile on Williamson's face. Another cutter, right in the slot, around off. Yusuf clears his front leg and smashes the length over long-on. A boundary after 35 balls, first six of the innings."
18.2,"Mustafizur to Pathan, no run","a low full toss outside off, smashed to deep cover. No run again. He just can't hit a boundary."
18.1,"Mustafizur to Pathan, no run","an offcutter outside off, Yusuf tries to sweep the ball but he isn't close to the ball. He's now 23 off 30."
17.6,"Bumrah to Pathan, 1 run","a good length delivery outside off, guided away to backward point for a quick run"
17.5,"Bumrah to Pathan, no run","141 kph, a low full toss outside off, sliced to short third man. Markande goes flying to his left and stops the ball, to the awe of the crowd."
17.4,"Bumrah to Pathan, 2 runs","smashed down to long-off. A slower ball is hammered back past the bowler. Bumrah sticks out his right hand, but the ball flies past. Pollard throws to the batsman's end, but he's fine"
17.3,"Bumrah to Pathan, no run","a shortish delivery around off, pulled down to long-on. Still no run. Sunrisers going nowhere."
17.2,"Bumrah to Pathan, no run","full and quick, around off, 142 kph, guided to point"
17.1,"Bumrah to Pathan, no run",a shorter and wide slower delivery is slashed to the sweeper cover. Yusuf declines the run.
16.6,"Mustafizur to Sandeep, no run","a full delivery on off, nicely blocked back."
16.5,"Mustafizur to Kaul, OUT","run-out! Terrible from Sunrisers. They've had a shocking evening. A slower ball outside off, Kaul finally gets bat on it. Slices a drive to point. Hardik Pandya misfields, which makes Kaul think there is a single. Pathan comes running down, sees Pandya's throw is coming and returns back to his crease, allowing Kaul to sacrifice himself. The ball pops out of Kishan's gloves, just as he made contact with the stumps"
16.4,"Mustafizur to Kaul, no run","a hat-trick of slower balls that beat Kaul's outside edge. Full and moving away, beats a drive rather easily."
16.3,"Mustafizur to Kaul, no run",another one! Yet another offcutter and the ball beats the bat.
16.2,"Mustafizur to Kaul, no run","a full offcutter outside off, eliciting a drive but not an edge as the ball flies past the outside edge."
16.1,"Mustafizur to Pathan, 1 run","a full delivery outside off, slashed to deep point for a run"
15.6,"Markande to Kaul, no run","excellently bowled, very slow through the air outside off, loads of flight. The ball leaves Sid Kaul on the outside edge."
15.5,"Markande to Kaul, no run","the legbreak outside off, played to backward point with the angle and a slightly-open face."
15.4,"Markande to Kaul, no run","yet another googly, shortish and wide, carved to backward point. Played off the back foot."
15.3,"Markande to Kaul, 2 runs","it's another googly, drifts down leg, nudged away to fine leg for a couple."
15.2,"Markande to Kaul, no run","slow down leg, worked into the leg side."
15.1,"Markande to Basil, OUT","gone through Thampi and Markande strikes! It's a flatter delivery, quick through the air and short. Yet, Thampi misreads the length, goes back and looks to cut, he fails to connect, but the ball hits off stump."
14.6,"Mustafizur to Pathan, no run","beaten on the outside edge. Yet another offcutter, it grips and moves to beat the bat."
14.5,"Mustafizur to Basil, 1 run","a big shot but he somehow finds a gap behind point. Another cutter outside off, Thampi looks for a big hit, but the ball skews off the outside half and over the infield."
14.4,"Mustafizur to Basil, no run",nicely guided with the angle but he picks out backward point. A short cutter from Mustafizur.
14.3,"Mustafizur to Pathan, 1 run","124 kph, short and wide outside off, slashed away to deep point for one."
14.2,"Mustafizur to Basil, 1 run","back of a length outside off, an offcutter, chopped down to third man for one."
14.1,"Mustafizur to Pathan, 1 run","a length offcutter outside off, punched to the sweeper cover for one."
13.6,"Bumrah to Basil, no run",a full delivery outside off is guided away to backward point.
13.5,"Bumrah to Pathan, 1 run","back of a length outside off, chopped down to third man for one."
13.4,"Bumrah to Basil, 1 run",a short delivery outside off is ramped over the infield for one to third man
13.3,"Bumrah to Rashid Khan, OUT","outside edge and gone! Good captaincy from Rohit. That's exactly how Rashid was caught in the reverse fixture earlier this season. Back of a length delivery outside off, Rashid plays slightly inside the line, a thick edge is elicited and comfortably taken."
13.2,"Bumrah to Pathan, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, Yusuf taps a length delivery to backward point. There is no run there. Lewis runs in, picks up but misses at the batsman's end."
13.1,"Bumrah to Rashid Khan, 1 run","a good length delivery outside off, a thick outside edge flies down to third man for one"
12.6,"Krunal to Rashid Khan, 1 run","flat and quick, on leg, inside-edged away behind square for a run."
12.5,"Krunal to Pathan, 1 run","flat and straight, nudged to short fine leg for one."
12.4,"Krunal to Pathan, FOUR runs","that's short and wide, right where Yusuf was waiting for that. Waits and waits and then laces a cut behind point for four."
12.3,"Krunal to Rashid Khan, 1 run","nicely bowled, flat and straight, pushed away to long-off, one more."
12.2,"Krunal to Rashid Khan, 2 runs","strays down leg again, swept away behind square. Another misfield from Mustafizur."
12.1,"Krunal to Pathan, 1 run","strays down leg, swept away towards short fine leg"
12.1,"Krunal to Pathan, 1 wide","starts with a leg side delivery that drifts down leg, wide called."
11.6,"Markande to Pathan, 1 run","slightly shorter and wider, cut away to backward point for a run."
11.5,"Markande to Rashid Khan, 1 run","the sweep, the googly outside off. Rashid gets some bat on his sweep, one to deep square leg."
11.4,"Markande to Rashid Khan, no run","nicely bowled, slower around off, tapped away towards backward point"
11.3,"Markande to Rashid Khan, no run","out comes the sweep, a cross-batted shot is always an indicator the batsman isn't sure. The legbreak outside off, Rashid misses the sweep."
11.2,"Markande to Rashid Khan, no run","the legbreak this time. Flat outside off, there is some zip and some turn as the ball beats the bat"
11.1,"Markande to M Nabi, OUT","the googly goes through Nabi's wild heave. It pitched outside off, and turned back in. Nabi clears a front leg and swings, looking to clear midwicket, an indicator he read the variation. But the ball finds a massive gap between bat and pad to hit the stumps. Sunrisers now struggling."
10.6,"Krunal to Pathan, no run","quick and straight, defended back. Yusuf now 8 off 13."
10.5,"Krunal to Pathan, no run","nice, more slowness and extracts some turn. Outside off, Yusuf gets forward and blocks"
10.4,"Krunal to M Nabi, 1 run","flat and straight, a thick inside edge towards midwicket"
10.3,"Krunal to M Nabi, no run","another leading edge. Slow on middle and leg, gets some turn too. Off the top edge towards midwicket"
10.2,"Krunal to Pathan, 1 run","a dart, 95 kph, on the pads. Yusuf closes his bat face too early, a thick leading edge lobs over midwicket, one to long-on"
10.1,"Krunal to M Nabi, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, drilled down to long-off for one."
9.6,"Markande to Pathan, no run","a big appeal, pad first, think Mumbai. But it's a legbreak that may have struck Yusuf outside the line. With the spin, that's missing off stump too. But Mumbai want to review. It is pad first, but that needed to be a googly. Yusuf got forward and looked to defend, the ball struck him outside the line and the spin is also taking that away from the stumps, says HawkEye."
9.5,"Markande to M Nabi, 1 run","flat outside off, 84 kph, pushed to the sweeper cover for one with the spin"
9.4,"Markande to Pathan, 1 run","flat on middle and leg, 80 kph, nudged to deep midwicket again. The runs have come this over."
9.3,"Markande to Pathan, FOUR runs",the googly. But he drifts down leg. Yusuf stays low and just paddles his fine sweep to the fine leg boundary. Well played.
9.2,"Markande to M Nabi, 1 run","flatter, on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
9.1,"Markande to M Nabi, FOUR runs","a short delivery outside off, Nabi rocks back and pulls the ball into the gap at midwicket. Too short, too slow. An easy put-away."
8.6,"Pandya to Pathan, no run","132 kph, sticks with the shorter length. A decent bouncer. Pathan gets underneath that."
8.6,"Pandya to Pathan, 1 wide","strays down leg this time, another extra delivery"
8.5,"Pandya to M Nabi, 1 run","back of a length outside off, Nabi opens the bat face and guides that down to third man"
8.4,"Pandya to M Nabi, FOUR runs","ooh yeah, that's glorious. Regal some may say. An overpitched half volley outside off and Williamson leans into a delectable drive through cover, gets four."
8.3,"Pandya to Pathan, 1 run","a length delivery outside off, 135 kph. Dabbed away down to third man for a run."
8.2,"Pandya to M Nabi, 1 run","a full delivery outside off, 139 kph, a thick inside edge through wide mid-on for a run."
8.1,"Pandya to Williamson, OUT","inside edge? Yes. Williamson is walking. And Sunrisers sink further. There';s some seam movement for Hardik, a length delivery seams back in after pitching. Williamson plays close to his body, but the ball still moves back in enough to take the inside edge. An easy take for the keeper."
7.6,"Mustafizur to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length outside off, stabbed through cover off the back foot"
7.5,"Mustafizur to Pathan, 1 run",slower ball at a length on leg stump. Gets deep in the crease and dabs it behind square with soft hands
7.4,"Mustafizur to Pathan, no run","slower ball, back of a length and just outside off. Defended into the covers off the back foot"
7.3,"Mustafizur to Williamson, 1 run",another perfect pull. This one a little higher - lifting up at his face - but he manages to keep it down. McClenaghan dives early this time -  a bit too early. Ends up pushing it away from his face as he's on the floor
7.2,"Mustafizur to Williamson, no run","short of a length just outside off, defended to point off the back foot"
7.1,"Mustafizur to Williamson, FOUR runs","hammered. Superb pull shot from Williamson - technical perfection. Mustafiz drops it short of a length at his hips and he swivels, gets the bat parallel to the ground, watches the ball come on and keeps it down to beat deep square to his right"
6.6,"Pandya to Pathan, no run",slower ball at a yorker length. Pathan clears his leg and jams it out towards short extra cover
6.5,"Pandya to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length outside off. Pulls to deep square"
6.4,"Pandya to Williamson, no run",good length and just outside off. Tapped back to the bowler off the front foot
6.3,"Pandya to Williamson, no run",short of a length and in at off stump. Defended to point off the back foot
6.2,"Pandya to Williamson, FOUR runs","short of a length outside off. He gets his weight on the back foot and slices between point and gully. Third man sprints to his right and manages to get a hand on it with a slide, but that was travelling too fast"
6.1,"Pandya to Williamson, no run","beaten on the outside edge. Length ball banged into the corridor, moving away off the seam. Williamson looks to run it to third man but can't connect"
5.6,"McClenaghan to Pathan, 4 byes","Kishan's horror day behind the stumps continues. Predictably, Pathan gets a bouncer. It's well directed and has him ducking, but Kishan parries it over"
5.5,"McClenaghan to Pathan, no run",falls short of mid-off. Length ball outside off and Pathan pummels it on the up towards mid-off. It dips on him and he might have dived if it weren't for Pathan's power behind it
5.4,"McClenaghan to Williamson, 1 run","length on off stump, goes deep in the crease and nudges it through point off the outside half"
5.3,"McClenaghan to Williamson, OUT",mix-up and Shakib will be shown the way eventually. Got none of that from his partner. It's an offcutter that Williamson taps in front of short midwicket with soft hands. Takes the instinctive two steps forward but without a call. No call from Shakib either - they're both looking at the ball. There's no run there. Shakib is halfway down. Midwicket swivels and takes the non-striker's stumps down on the bounce .ah hang on. We've looked at the replays and it sounds like Williamson said yes first and then no.
5.2,"McClenaghan to Shakib, 1 run",length ball angled in at off stump. Closes the face and drags it to mid-on's left off the front foot
5.1,"McClenaghan to Shakib, no run",short ball coming in at the corridor. Chops it straight to point
4.6,"Pandya to Shakib, 1 run","short of a length outside off. Punches neatly to cover point's left but Krunal dives one-handed to get in the way of at least another run, if not three more"
4.5,"Pandya to Shakib, no run",length on off stump. Defended back to the bowler
4.4,"Pandya to Pandey, OUT","straight to extra cover! Pandey's daredevilry comes to a close. An aesthetically pleasing innings ends in a tame, throwaway manner. Length ball wide outside off. He gives it the charge and can't get elevation on the drive to clear the fielder"
4.3,"Pandya to Pandey, no run",beaten. A jab with an open face. Length ball outside off with some climb. He can't get bat as he tries to find the third man boundary
4.2,"Pandya to Williamson, 1 run",length and just outside off. Drops it into the off side with soft hands
4.2,"Pandya to Williamson, 1 wide","short of a length and down leg side, left alone"
4.1,"Pandya to Williamson, FOUR runs",inside edge zips past short fine. Pandya starts in a nice area - length on off stump. Williamson brings an angled bat down on it as he pushes on the front foot. Tentative. Effective.
3.6,"McClenaghan to Pandey, FOUR runs","he's come out with a plan. Pandey walks down the track a touch, uses the shuffle across again and gets close to this length ball pushed wide. Thumps it on the up over mid-off"
3.5,"McClenaghan to Pandey, 2 runs","nicely timed, but Krunal keeps it to one. Uses the angle across him to open the face and chop this behind point. Krunal gets his full body behind it with a slide at deep backward point"
3.4,"McClenaghan to Pandey, no run",length and slanted across off. Shuffles to try and tickle one behind square. Can't get it off the pitch
3.3,"McClenaghan to Pandey, no run","offcutter, back of a length and just outside off. Gets on top of the bounce and dabs it straight to short third man"
3.2,"McClenaghan to Pandey, FOUR runs",sweeet. Pandey stands tall and slaps one over the non-striker. Length ball wide outside off but he shuffles and closes the face as he lifts this on the up
3.1,"McClenaghan to Pandey, no run","short of a length and cutting away outside off, left alone"
2.6,"Bumrah to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length outside off, drives on the up to deep point"
2.5,"Bumrah to Williamson, 1 run",good length on off stump. Allows it to come on again and drops it into the point region with soft hands
2.4,"Bumrah to Pandey, 1 run","length outside off, driven on the up to sweeper point"
2.3,"Bumrah to Pandey, FOUR runs","shot. Back of a length with width from Bumrah and he eases into this, without any feet movement. Just opens the face and steers it through point"
2.2,"Bumrah to Williamson, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Allows it to come on and steers it to third man with an open face
2.1,"Bumrah to Williamson, no run","full and in at off stump. Driven firmly, straight to mid-off"
1.6,"McClenaghan to Saha, OUT","got him! Saha chases again and isn't as lucky as before! McClenaghan, not a public favourite in Mumbai these days, has brought two wickets in his first over. Another length ball pushed across him and this time he's looking to drive away from the body. A thin edge and Kishan holds on"
1.5,"McClenaghan to Saha, no run",beaten on the outside edge. Saha gets one slanted across his corridor and he jabs at it on the front foot
1.4,"McClenaghan to S Dhawan, OUT","bowled him! Same ball, same shot, inside edge again. Dhawan driving with a gap between bat and pad again. This time the stride is even shorter, possibly because of the bump he got last ball. It hits that back leg again, but this time on the thigh, before taking out the stumps"
1.3,"McClenaghan to S Dhawan, no run",Dhawan gets one on the knee cap. Can't catch a break! Length ball slanting in from outside off. Gets on the front foot and looks to drive and gets an inside edge that misses the flap on the lunged back knee. Treatment time ice treatment. Followed by some mobility exercises.
1.2,"McClenaghan to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",one bounce and four. Third man would've taken that but there isn't one. It's a length ball wide outside off. He slashes on the up and deliberately opens the face
1.2,"McClenaghan to S Dhawan, 5 wide",oh dear. Kishan misses a straightforward take. Mitch attempts a yorker that goes down leg side. Kishan makes the ground but can't hold on
1.1,"McClenaghan to Williamson, 1 run","length ball wide outside off, goes on the up and can't get on top of the bounce. Ends up slicing on the up to sweeper"
0.6,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, no run",misses a full toss. That couldn't have been different from the throwdowns he was taking earlier. Shin height full toss outside off but he can't get any bat on it whatsoever as he looks to drive
0.5,"Bumrah to Williamson, 1 run",short of a length and in at middle. Stands tall and nudges it to mid-on with soft hands
0.4,"Bumrah to Williamson, FOUR runs","surreal. He threads one through point and cover again, this time off the front foot. No one quite as gorgeous as Williamson on the square drive these days. This is a full ball swinging well away from him but he gets there with a big stride and caresses it"
0.3,"Bumrah to Williamson, FOUR runs","here we go. Can't have a Williamson innings without him getting on his toes, getting the elbow high and punching one between point and cover. That's exactly what he's done to this length ball in the corridor"
0.2,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, 1 run",short of a length this time. Rising up at his thigh guard and he can't get bat on the attempted glance. Gets a single behind square
0.1,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, no run",starts short. A touch down leg side. 50-50 wide ball. The umpire says it's okay after Dhawan lets it go
19.6,"Mujeeb to Iyer, OUT",taken at long-off and Kings XI win by four runs. Gambhir has his head in his hands. Iyer looks up. A flatter trajectory delivery outside off is chipped away to long-off. Finch takes the reverse-cupped catch and Kings XI begin their celebrations.
19.5,"Mujeeb to Iyer, FOUR runs","and he gets four. Flat down leg, helped along past short fine leg. He dives in vain. Big play because it's four. FOUR"
19.4,"Mujeeb to Iyer, 2 runs",slogged away with bad timing to deep midwicket. A misfield allows two. Struggled for timing. Iyer initially didn't want even one.
19.3,"Mujeeb to Iyer, no run","refuses the single. Flat outside off, powered to long-off. Says no. I'll take this over."
19.2,"Mujeeb to Iyer, SIX runs","six! NOT OVER YET. It's flat and wide, Iyer stands back and slaps a swat straight back over the bowler's head for six. sensational timing. Delhi are dancing again."
19.1,"Mujeeb to Iyer, no run","good length, flat down leg. Iyer can't connect. The ball hits the pad to fine leg."
18.6,"Barinder Sran to Mishra, no run","it's in the slot for that shot. Full and wide, Mishra comes down and misses a swing. DOT!"
18.5,"Barinder Sran to Iyer, 1 run","that was in the slot, right in the slot. Full on off, Iyer cleared his front leg too and slogged to long-on"
18.4,"Barinder Sran to Mishra, 1 run",he walks right across and connects neatly with the lap scoop but he finds the keeper. It's a slower delivery well outside off. That missed off stump by not much. Iyer forces him to complete the run.
18.3,"Barinder Sran to Iyer, 1 run","a shortish delivery on middle and leg, swatted away to long-on, on the bounce."
18.2,"Barinder Sran to Plunkett, OUT","a golden duck for Plunkett. A slower delivery down leg from Sran. Excellent variation, because Plunkett meets the ball much earlier than he intended. As a result, a whip intended for midwicket goes aerially to deep square leg, where Nair takes a comfortable catch."
18.1,"Barinder Sran to Iyer, 1 run","a length delivery outside off, pulled away to deep midwicket for one. Not quite timed."
17.6,"Tye to Tewatia, OUT","edged and gone. A slower ball from Tye, the knuckle ball outside off. Tewatia slogs but all he manages is a thick leading edge, which is easily taken by Rahul. A timely strike because it also gets a new batsman in."
17.5,"Tye to Iyer, 1 run","well bowled, a yorker outside off, jammed away for one."
17.4,"Tye to Iyer, 2 runs","well bowled. A low full toss outside off, guided to Yuvraj at backward point who unnecessarily throws at the bowler's end to concede an overthrow. Poor game awareness from the experienced man. Iyer was well in anyway."
17.3,"Tye to Tewatia, 1 run","full on middle and leg, heaved away to deep midwicket."
17.3,"Tye to Tewatia, 1 wide","a slower ball, too wide outside off though. And called."
17.2,"Tye to Iyer, 1 run","falls short of Finch at long-off. Full outside off, looking to use the bottom hand to lift the ball through midwicket. Chipped to long-off instead. Think Iyer has played this very smartly"
17.1,"Tye to Tewatia, 1 run","short and wide outside off, slashed to third man for a run."
16.6,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, 1 run","a good yorker to finish. On leg, jammed out for one."
16.5,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, 2 runs","that's another mistake from Sran. He's having a shocker. Short and wide outside off, slapped to wide long-off. Finch returns the throw at the bowler's end, at an awkward height. He misses the collection with Iyer well outside his crease. Big error."
16.4,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, FOUR runs","finds the gap for four. Full outside off, Tewatia feigns one shot, then the other. Eventually, he walks across and sweeps the fast bowler behind square leg for four. When did No. 7 start sweeping fast bowlers for fun?"
16.3,"Barinder Sran to Iyer, 1 run","a short, slower ball around off, punched to long-on for one. He's biding his time well"
16.2,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, 1 run","a low full toss down leg, swiped away to deep midwicket"
16.1,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, SIX runs","smashed for six. Tewatia backs away, makes room and Sran follows him. But what he does badly is bowl it on a full length, right in the slot. And slammed back over his head for six."
15.6,"Tye to Tewatia, 1 run","a shorter, slower delivery outside off. Carved away to the sweeper cover for one."
15.5,"Tye to Tewatia, no run","a shorter delivery outside off, slashed away to backward point. Trying to create some room."
15.4,"Tye to Iyer, 1 run","a slower delivery around off, worked away to deep square leg for one."
15.3,"Tye to Tewatia, 1 leg bye","strays on the pads but it also cramps Tewatia for room. Struck on the pad, one leg bye to short fine leg."
15.2,"Tye to Iyer, 1 run","a short slower delivery around off, nudged away to deep square leg for a run"
15.1,"Tye to Tewatia, 1 run","one bounce to deep midwicket. A slower delivery around off, a muscled swat to deep midwicket."
14.6,"Mujeeb to Iyer, 2 runs","short and wide outside off, carved away through backward point for a couple. Superb batting."
14.5,"Mujeeb to Iyer, FOUR runs","hammered for four. A tad too full this time from Mujeeb, Iyer stays balanced as he drills an on-drive past his partner."
14.4,"Mujeeb to Tewatia, 1 run","a thick inside edge onto the pad. Flat on off, the inside edge takes the ball to square leg."
14.3,"Mujeeb to Tewatia, no run","the one that moves the other way. Flat and wide, the ball moves away and beats the bat. Lovely bowling."
14.2,"Mujeeb to Tewatia, no run","the slider. Quick down leg, Tewatia misses a flick. Struck on the thigh pad as he misses that."
14.1,"Mujeeb to Iyer, 1 run","overpitched on off, whipped to long-on for a run."
13.6,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","another carrom ball, on middle and off. Punched to long-off."
13.5,"Ashwin to Iyer, no run","a carrom ball, on middle. Tewatia comes down, but is sent back. Tiwary misses at the bowler's end."
13.4,"Ashwin to Tewatia, 1 run","flat outside off, Tewatia goes back and punches one to long-off for one."
13.3,"Ashwin to Tewatia, no run","another dot. Flat around off, pushed to cover."
13.2,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","the carrom ball around off, punched to long-on"
13.1,"Ashwin to Tewatia, 1 run","flat on middle and leg, worked to midwicket for a run."
12.6,"Barinder Sran to Iyer, no run","Iyer reviews immediately! Full and wide outside off, Iyer goes after a drive and misses. The bat hits the ground as it passes. The ball misses. Umpire Nanda Kishore has got that one wrong. The match would have been very different without DRS. At least, the right decision made."
12.6,"Barinder Sran to Iyer, 1 wide",strays down leg for the third wide of the over. Sloppy.
12.5,"Barinder Sran to Iyer, no run","much better from Sran. Stick to the basics. Good length on middle and leg, defended back."
12.4,"Barinder Sran to Iyer, 2 runs","guided past backward point for two. Full and wide, dabbed past point for two."
12.3,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, 1 run","back of a length on off, pulled to long-on for a run. Hurried for pace."
12.3,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, 1 wide","called a wide! Was that over the head? A short delivery outside off, a knuckle ball bouncer that is indeed over the head. This is not very good bowling, why vary to a No. 7 when he isn't trying too much."
12.2,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, no run","full and straight, pushed back to the bowler. That's a better delivery, why vary unnecessarily?"
12.2,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, 1 wide","a slower ball goes very wrong. Back of the hand outside off, outside the tramline and called"
12.1,"Barinder Sran to Tewatia, 2 runs","goes short first up, helped along behind square for a couple. Not quite in control."
11.6,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run, OUT","too straight and worked into the gap at midwicket. The throw back to Ashwin is good, he takes the bails off in a hurry and he thinks he has Christian. And he does. Christian is short of his crease. Sensational work from Agarwal at long-on. First, to run to his right and pick up with one hand, then releasing so quickly. And then, throwing the ball well despite being off balance. Ashwin does the easier job of taking the bails off, but he did that very quickly too."
11.5,"Ashwin to Iyer, no run","the carrom again. Out the front of the hand. Tidy line, just around off, pushed to point"
11.4,"Ashwin to Christian, 1 run","a carrom ball outside off, pushed into the gap at midwicket for one."
11.3,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","shortish and wide, carved to backward point"
11.2,"Ashwin to Iyer, FOUR runs","that's a filthy delivery, drops short outside off. Iyer rocks back and pummels the long-hop of a legbreak to the deep cover fence"
11.1,"Ashwin to Christian, 1 run","the legbreak, flat and wide, slashed to deep point for a run."
10.6,"Mujeeb to Christian, 1 run","just three off the over. Very full, met by a crisp drive from Christian. A misfield from Ashwin lets the ball go through."
10.5,"Mujeeb to Iyer, 1 run","very full outside off, Iyer opens the bat face and carves a ball to deep cover for one"
10.4,"Mujeeb to Iyer, no run","another dot, quick and straight, finds midwicket again"
10.3,"Mujeeb to Iyer, no run",nudged to midwicket from the back foot
10.2,"Mujeeb to Christian, 1 run","Mujeeb thinks he has got bat on it. Iyer thinks he's fine. But the third umpire is called on. Full outside off, christian belts a drive right back at the bowler, who sticks out his right hand. The ball bursts through the fingers and hits the stump at the bowler's end, but Iyer's bat is in."
10.1,"Mujeeb to Christian, no run",inside edge onto the pad. It's flat and quick on off. Christian tries to finds one through square leg.
9.6,"Ashwin to Iyer, no run","back to his flatter trajectory, on middle and off, worked to midwicket. The tidy overs are racking up."
9.5,"Ashwin to Iyer, no run",
9.4,"Ashwin to Iyer, no run","a massive appeal, no, says umpire CK Nandan. Slow outside off, the ball pitches outside off and spins back in to hit Iyer in front of off. Replays say missing leg."
9.3,"Ashwin to Christian, 1 run","very quick and full outside off, driven to long-off"
9.2,"Ashwin to Christian, no run","the carrom ball, full outside off, pushed to cover."
9.1,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","a flat start, on middle, clipped to deep midwicket"
8.6,"Mujeeb to Iyer, 1 run","flat and quick outside off, no flight, no room. Iyer goes back and pushes the ball in front of point for one."
8.5,"Mujeeb to Christian, 1 run","drifts down leg this time, clipped down to fine leg for one."
8.4,"Mujeeb to Christian, no run","four dot balls! flat outside off, punched back to the bowler"
8.3,"Mujeeb to Christian, no run","another carrom ball-type delivery, on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
8.2,"Mujeeb to Christian, no run","flat on middle and leg, worked to midwicket from the back foot."
8.1,"Mujeeb to Pant, OUT","Mujeeb strikes first ball! Kings XI continue to fight. His first ball is a flick out of the front of the hand, it pitches outside off and spins back in with the angle and the direction of release. It finds a massive gap between bat and pad and knocks into off stump. Daredevils are in some trouble."
7.6,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run","drifts in, pitches and spins away from middle, defended with soft hands"
7.5,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","short and spinning down leg, works to deep square leg"
7.4,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run",whips this from outside off to deep square leg
7.3,"Ashwin to Pant, no run",lunges forward and smothers this
7.2,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","works this skiddy delivery to midwicket. Went across a long way, would've been a dead duck had he missed it"
7.1,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run",works this indrifter towards midwicket
6.6,"Rajpoot to Iyer, FOUR runs","cut away past the diving point fielder. Mujeeb does all the hard work in getting to the ball from square third man but can't collect it cleanly and ends up pushing it into the advertising triangles as he tries to pull it back in. For someone that young, you have to say Mujeeb's fielding is quite ordinary."
6.5,"Rajpoot to Iyer, FOUR runs",short-arm jab but the timing is magnificent. Bisects midwicket and mid on. Lovely from Iyer
6.4,"Rajpoot to Iyer, no run",gets on top of the bounce and wrists this short of length delivery to mid on
6.3,"Rajpoot to Iyer, no run",gets a good stride forward and defends this solidly to the off side
6.2,"Rajpoot to Iyer, no run",hit high on the thigh pad as he hops back to defend. Stifled appeal but too high
6.1,"Rajpoot to Iyer, no run",squirts this to point. Closed the bat face early in trying to nudge this into the leg side.
5.6,"Tye to Iyer, 5 runs","turns this slower delivery from outside off towards midwicket. Oh, dear. Four overthrows, so make that five. Miller throws to the bowler's end, but Tye misses. Finch, backing up, also misses as this squeezes below him"
5.5,"Tye to Pant, 1 run","looked to sway out of the way but somehow didn't get his bat away in time, deflects to third man."
5.4,"Tye to Pant, no run",gets well forward and defends solidly
5.3,"Tye to Gambhir, OUT","gets a leading edge straight to mid-off. Gambhir was woefully out of form, was failing to hit anything off the middle and has now paid the price. Looked to hop across and work to the leg side but closed the bat face too early. Are Kings XI fighting back?"
5.2,"Tye to Gambhir, no run","slower length ball across Gambhir, who defends to cover"
5.1,"Tye to Gambhir, no run","slower length ball on middle, Gambhir waits, waits and then defends"
4.6,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, 1 run",hops across and whips to deep square
4.5,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, OUT","this went really, really high in the air. Maxwell has ended up mistiming this pull and Tye takes a superbly judged catch at deep square leg. Looked to fetch it from outside off, this was an effort delivery from Rajpoot. Maxwell got this high on the bat."
4.4,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, no run",whups this from outside off to Yuvraj at midwicket
4.3,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, 1 run",works this off his hip to deep square leg
4.3,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, 1 wide","shapes to pull but this got big on him, umpire thinks way over Gambhir's head. Wide called"
4.2,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, no run","right behind the line of this length ball as he defends. Off-cutter from Rajpoot, kept just a touch low."
4.1,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, no run",shows the full face of the bat to ease this back
3.6,"Tye to Maxwell, no run","played three shots in one! First looks to pull, then realises this bouncer is on off and tries to ramp, misses. Beaten"
3.5,"Tye to Maxwell, no run",is there an edge there? Thought I heard something. Maxwell looks to run this off the bat face wide of the keeper.
3.4,"Tye to Maxwell, no run","steps out to whack this slower ball into the neighbouring football stadium, but misses. Swung through too early. Head all over the place"
3.3,"Tye to Maxwell, SIX runs","ah, super strike that! Walloped into the deep backward square leg fence. Too full, too straight and down leg, Maxwell just walloped it away. Bread and butter stroke for him"
3.2,"Tye to Gambhir, 1 leg bye","hint of curve back in to hit the pad as Gambhir looks to flick. He was slightly off balance. Big appeal, but no review. Replays confirm this pitched outside leg."
3.2,"Tye to Gambhir, 1 wide",slower one down leg. Rolled through to the keeper as Gambhir looked to tickle it fine
3.1,"Tye to Maxwell, 1 run",squeezes the drive to mid off for a quick single
2.6,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, 1 run",works this length ball into the leg side for an easy single
2.5,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, no run","crunching drive, super stop at point by Yuvraj. Threw himself to his left to effect a one-handed stop"
2.4,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, FOUR runs","works this from middle to beat midwicket. Short leg side boundaries makes it tougher to stop once it cross the 30-yard circle. Lovely timing, good wrist work"
2.3,"Rajpoot to Shaw, OUT","knocked him over! Played one shot too many. Shaped to pull but the length wasn't there for the stroke, beat the inside edge and crashed into the off stump. Completely missed the line, made matters tougher by trying to play across the line. He's given them a good start though."
2.2,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, 1 run",dabs this gently into the off side as they scamper a single.  An under-arm flick from Agarwal at point and Shaw may have been gone 
2.1,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, no run",solid forward defence to a length ball angling away.
1.6,"Barinder Sran to Shaw, 2 runs","swivel-pull but just about clears wide mid-on. Expensive, expensive over. Shaw didn't get hold of this pull as well as he would've liked."
1.5,"Barinder Sran to Shaw, FOUR runs",slashes and gets a thick outside edge that flies over the slip fielder.
1.4,"Barinder Sran to Gambhir, 1 run","slants this into the pads, worked to deep fine leg. Gambhir is off the mark"
1.3,"Barinder Sran to Shaw, 3 runs","this time he pulls, doesn't get hold of it as well as he would've liked but will take three as Finch gives it a laboured chase from mid on"
1.2,"Barinder Sran to Shaw, FOUR runs","races away to the boundary like a?    .. TRACER BULLET!  Short of length and angling away, Shaw stood tall and slapped that behind point. Woah, delightful timing and placement"
1.1,"Barinder Sran to Shaw, FOUR runs",nearly chopped on! Looked to flay this on the up through point but got a thick inside edge that beat the keeper to the boundary
0.6,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, no run","big appeal for lbw. Gambhir was on his toes when he was struck. Height was surely in question there, but no. Ashwin thinks otherwise and has asked for a review.. Pitch map shows this hit the turf outside leg,  so nothing else matters."
0.5,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, no run","nervous little poke to an away-going delivery, didn't miss the edge by much"
0.5,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, 1 wide","slides one down leg, excellent stop by Rahul. The ball bounced before him as well."
0.4,"Rajpoot to Shaw, 1 run",whips this length ball from outside off to wide mid-on
0.3,"Rajpoot to Shaw, FOUR runs","up and away, although he would've had a brief flutter. Lofts this length ball through the line, just managed to clear Ashwin at mid-off"
0.2,"Rajpoot to Shaw, no run","no feet movement, feels for the length ball outside off, defended back."
0.1,"Rajpoot to Shaw, no run","short of length delivery that jags away off the seam from outside off, defended back as he gets onto his toes"
19.6,"Boult to Tye, OUT","132 kph, Tye chops on! Wow, that was a struggle from Tye, 3 off 9. Full and wide, Tye unwinds and swings, but all he manages is a thick inside edge which hits middle and leg stump."
19.5,"Boult to Tye, no run","yikes, he isn't even close to the ball. A short slower cutter outside off. Tye is beaten as he swings."
19.4,"Boult to Tye, 2 runs","full on leg, flicked away wide of long-on for a couple. Maxwell can't prevent two"
19.3,"Boult to Tye, no run",another slower ball. Cutter. Tye swings and misses again. The ball clips the pad and then bounces over the leg stump
19.2,"Boult to Barinder Sran, 1 leg bye","think the wide yorker would have been a better option to earn a dot ball. But Boult goes full and straight, Sran misses, struck on the pad, but it's sliding down"
19.1,"Boult to Ashwin, OUT","taken. Ashwin picks out backward point. Another wide yorker, Ashwin gets underneath the length but all he successfully does is chip a slice to the fielder. A comfortable reverse-cupped catch."
19.1,"Boult to Ashwin, 1 wide","starts with a wide. Full and very wide, looking for the tramline but just errs."
18.6,"Plunkett to Tye, no run","swing and miss. What a debut for Plunkett. So many cutters, finishes with 3 for 17. A slower ball outside off, Tye swings too early."
18.5,"Plunkett to Ashwin, 1 bye","114 kph, a slower bouncer. Ashwin walks across but can't connect. The ball bounces in front of Pant, ricochets off the hand to short fine leg"
18.4,"Plunkett to Ashwin, 2 runs","a slower delivery outside off, punched away to deep cover for a couple. Shaw again takes a fraction of a second longer to release, he has to develop a quicker release in time."
18.4,"Plunkett to Ashwin, 1 wide","strays down leg, extra run, extra ball."
18.3,"Plunkett to Tye, 1 run","finally bat meets ball. A slower cutter around off, heaved away to deep midwicket for one run."
18.2,"Plunkett to Tye, no run","nicely bowled. Goes wide of the crease, full outside off. Tye still can't get bat on ball, misses his third slog."
18.1,"Plunkett to Ashwin, 1 run",follows Ashwin as he backs away. A low full toss is bunted down to long-on
17.6,"Christian to Ashwin, 1 run","a length delivery on leg, pushed to long-on for a run. Tidy 18th for Delhi"
17.5,"Christian to Tye, 1 leg bye","a short slower ball. Tye is through his big hoick again, off the body to third man for a leg bye."
17.4,"Christian to Tye, 4 leg byes","115 kph, four leg byes, those are bad runs for Daredevils. A slower ball down leg, Tye slogs and misses. The ball takes the pad and flies away past Pant for four to fine leg"
17.3,"Christian to Miller, OUT",Miller finds Plunkett! And Kings XI are struggling now. It's yet another cutter outside off. Miller brings out all his power and brute force to smash a lofted drive over cover. But that fielder has been pushed back because Miller is very good with that shot. Plunkett gets low and takes an excellent catch.
17.2,"Christian to Miller, 2 runs","another slower delivery, on middle and leg. Slogged away into the gap in front of square for a couple."
17.1,"Christian to Miller, FOUR runs","a thick outside edge races away through third man! Another cutter, it actually cuts off the pitch. Takes the outside edge and flies to the third man boundary"
16.6,"Plunkett to Miller, 1 run","a good length delivery, 119 kph, another cutter, chopped into the pad and then point. Another tidy over, just five runs from it."
16.5,"Plunkett to Ashwin, 1 run","a very short, slower delivery around off is dragged down to fine leg, 116 kph."
16.4,"Plunkett to Miller, 1 leg bye","a full and quick delivery down leg, Miller is hurried for pace as he misses a flick, struck on the pad."
16.3,"Plunkett to Ashwin, 1 run","another cutter, outside off, chopped down to third man for a run."
16.2,"Plunkett to Miller, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, guided to point for a tight single"
16.1,"Plunkett to Nair, OUT","a slower delivery on middle and leg, and Nair picks out long-on! And it's taken! Juust. Plunkett is having a terrific debut. Nair looked to whip that slower cutter through midwicket but got that too straight. Iyer runs across from his right and pouches the catch after juggling."
15.6,"Mishra to Nair, 1 run",driven through the line to wide long-off. Expensive over.
15.5,"Mishra to Nair, FOUR runs","drifting into the pads, this time he's swept him to the left of short fine leg. Too easy for Nair. Gift of a delivery"
15.4,"Mishra to Miller, 1 run","flatter one on middle and leg, worked with the spin to deep square leg"
15.4,"Mishra to Miller, 1 wide","short and spinning away, far too wide on the googly. Left alone"
15.3,"Mishra to Miller, SIX runs","take that! Fetch that! He's hit that into the top tier over long-on. In his swinging arc, too full from Mishra. Whack. Remember that old quote? If it's in the arc, i'll hit you out of the park"
15.3,"Mishra to Nair, 2 wide","fired down leg, Nair misses the fine paddle, they scamper a leg bye as the ball rolls to short fine leg"
15.2,"Mishra to Miller, 1 run",eases this down to long off with the spin
15.1,"Mishra to Miller, no run"," Prithvi Shaw has put down a sitter at point!  Miller is living a charmed life here. Shaped to cut but checked his stroke, this lobbed up. He got his hands on it, juggled and put it down on the second attempt. What's happening?"
14.6,"Tewatia to Miller, 1 run",chops this cut to short third man.
14.5,"Tewatia to Miller, 2 runs","flat-bats this to long-off where Iyer slides around to stop this, can't stop the second though"
14.4,"Tewatia to Nair, 1 run","top-edges a sweep but safe, down to fine leg"
14.3,"Tewatia to Miller, 1 run", dropped by Maxwell at cover!  What's worse is they concede an overthrow. Miller rocks back and slaps this straight. Both feet were in the air as he went for the catch sideways and it popped out. Reprieves his old mate
14.2,"Tewatia to Miller, no run",goes back into the crease and defends this skiddy delivery
14.1,"Tewatia to Nair, 1 run",eased with the spin to sweeper cover
13.6,"Mishra to Nair, 1 run","powers this sweep behind square, down to the boundary rider. Prithvi Shaw it is"
13.5,"Mishra to Nair, 2 runs","full toss that he bunts down to wide long-on, superbly stopped by a slide by Dan Christian"
13.4,"Mishra to Nair, no run","gets down to paddle, may have got bat but it's well stopped, even if unintentionally,  by Pant, who offers his pad. He was moving to his left when the ball thudded into it. Lucky for Mishra"
13.3,"Mishra to Miller, 1 run","leading edge but safe, rolls to long-off. Was looking to work this through midwicket but didn't pick the googly"
13.2,"Mishra to Miller, 2 runs","touch short again, he makes room and punches this into the gap at deep cover"
13.1,"Mishra to Miller, 2 runs",uses the depth of the crease to punch this to sweeper cover
12.6,"Avesh Khan to Miller, 1 run",pushed through the line to mid-off for a quick single. Avesh bowls out and he's had a superb debut with Daredevils
12.5,"Avesh Khan to Miller, no run","this is a stunning delivery. Bowled at 145 clicks, whizzes across and beats Miller's push. Pant collected that over his head."
12.4,"Avesh Khan to Yuvraj, OUT","out to the pull, out to the pace! Yuvraj's struggle is over. This is a skiddy length ball angling way, Yuvraj had already decided he'll fetch the pull from outside off. The length wasn't quite there and so he gets an under-edge that is gleefully accepted by Pant."
12.3,"Avesh Khan to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","saved by an inside-edge that flies past Pant, who went the wrong way. This was a very thin one. Yuvraj is beaten for pace as he shapes to pull from outside off. Didn't miss the off stump by much."
12.2,"Avesh Khan to Nair, 1 run",works this low full toss down to long on
12.1,"Avesh Khan to Nair, FOUR runs","clean strike, solid strike. Uses the pace superbly as he backs away and lofts the length ball through the line over extra cover."
11.6,"Mishra to Yuvraj, no run","uppish, but lands short of short fine.This was fired in, Yuvraj toe-ended the paddle."
11.5,"Mishra to Nair, 1 run","drifts in a full delivery on the stumps from wide of the crease, eased to long on"
11.4,"Mishra to Yuvraj, 1 run",digs this yorker length ball back towards long off. Looked to biff this up and over
11.3,"Mishra to Yuvraj, no run",fizzes past Yuvraj's tentative forward push. Don't think he read the googly again. Lovely from Mishra
11.2,"Mishra to Yuvraj, no run",beaten by the googly. Shaped to steer this past the keeper but pulled out
11.1,"Mishra to Yuvraj, 2 runs","turns this gently with the spin towards deep fine leg, lazy effort in the deep. Should've just been one"
10.6,"Maxwell to Nair, no run",mistimes the reverse sweep to short third man
10.5,"Maxwell to Nair, no run","looks to go big over cover, but toe ends this back towards the bowler"
10.4,"Maxwell to Yuvraj, 1 run","straightens from length on middle, Yuvraj looks to work to the leg side, but gets a leading edge that rolls wide of cover"
10.3,"Maxwell to Nair, 1 run","steps out but Maxwell shortens his length, worked towards deep midwicket"
10.2,"Maxwell to Yuvraj, 1 run",drilled through to deep cover
10.1,"Maxwell to Nair, 1 run","floats this full on off, worked across the line towards deep midwicket"
9.6,"Mishra to Nair, 1 run","pushed through quicker outside off, punched but Iyer does well to sprint to his right and stop that with a dive. Some confusion with the running but they eventually complete the run"
9.5,"Mishra to Yuvraj, 1 run","drifts into the pads, worked with the spin to long on"
9.4,"Mishra to Yuvraj, no run","width outside off, punched straight to extra cover"
9.3,"Mishra to Yuvraj, 2 runs","crashes this short delivery to deep point. This was short and sliding away, Yuvraj picked the length early and made room to play the stroke"
9.2,"Mishra to Nair, 1 run","short and sliding down, pulled to deep square leg. Lucky to get away with that"
9.1,"Mishra to Nair, no run","lovely start. Drifts one in from wide of the crease, Nair gets forward and defends back"
8.6,"Christian to Nair, 1 run","a slower delivery on off, punched to long-on for a run."
8.5,"Christian to Nair, no run","a short delivery outside off, Nair tries to scoop the ball over short third man but makes no connection. Clever change in length."
8.4,"Christian to Yuvraj, 1 run","back of a length outside off, Yuvraj finds short third man. Only because there is a misfield, there is one"
8.3,"Christian to Yuvraj, no run","back of a length on leg, 129 kph, worked to midwicket"
8.2,"Christian to Yuvraj, no run","a cutter, offcutter outside off, 122 kph. Yuvraj misses an attempted drive, beats the outside edge"
8.1,"Christian to Yuvraj, no run","back of a length outside off, 130 kph. Yuvraj finds point with a dab"
7.6,"Plunkett to Nair, no run","135 kph, shorter and wider outside off, chopped away to cover."
7.5,"Plunkett to Nair, no run","good length, around off, pushed back to the bowler. Very tidy bowling."
7.4,"Plunkett to Yuvraj, 1 run","full around off, driven to mid-on for a single. Full face of the bat."
7.3,"Plunkett to Agarwal, OUT","gone through! 146 kph, Agarwal beaten for pace. A good length delivery, Agarwal anticipates another cutter, but it's quick. He tries a short-arm jab, but the ball isn't even short enough to play that stroke. He is far too late on the shot, the ball clips the thigh pad and then uproots off stump! A timely strike for Daredevils."
7.2,"Plunkett to Nair, 1 run","a shorter, slower delivery on middle. Nair helps that along towards fine leg. Avesh runs to his right and keeps the batsmen down to one, fine effort."
7.1,"Plunkett to Nair, no run","good length on off, the ball stays down a touch, worked to midwicket"
6.6,"Christian to Nair, 1 run","a slower ball on middle, clipped to deep midwicket for one. Decent over from Christian"
6.5,"Christian to Nair, FOUR runs","just tapped into the gap between short third man and backward point. It's dug in short, and a tad wide outside off. Nair just bunts that chopped cut into the gap, to third man's right."
6.4,"Christian to Agarwal, 1 run","short and wide outside off, slashed away to the sweeper cover. Too much width there."
6.3,"Christian to Nair, 1 run","back of a length around off, pushed away towards long-on for a run"
6.2,"Christian to Nair, no run","another cutter, slightly shorter around off, pushed back to the bowler"
6.1,"Christian to Agarwal, 1 run","a slower ball on middle and leg, nudged away to deep square leg for a run."
5.6,"Avesh Khan to Agarwal, 1 run","back of a length outside off, badly timed towards mid-on. A 51-run Powerplay."
5.5,"Avesh Khan to Agarwal, 2 runs","shorter and wide outside off, a flat-batted swat through cover for two. Kings XI's 50 is up."
5.4,"Avesh Khan to Agarwal, no run","slightly shorter and wide, but the pace was taken off. Chopped down to backward point,"
5.3,"Avesh Khan to Nair, 1 run","back of a length outside off, chopped away towards backward point. A good single"
5.2,"Avesh Khan to Nair, no run","full again, slightly closer to off stump though. Driven to short cover."
5.1,"Avesh Khan to Nair, FOUR runs",lovely shot. A tad overpitched from Avesh with some width. Nair strides forward and caresses a drive through cover with immaculate timing.
4.6,"Plunkett to Agarwal, no run","full and wide outside off, driven away towards cover with the full face."
4.5,"Plunkett to Agarwal, no run","a slower cutter again outside off, carved away to backward point."
4.4,"Plunkett to Nair, 1 run","right in between the gap at third slip and gully in Test cricket. But no one there in T20s. Full and wide outside off, Nair drives, gets a thick outside edge which flies to Mishra at third man. He fumbles, but no damage done."
4.3,"Plunkett to Rahul, OUT","did he misjudge that? He did, but he still took the catch at short fine leg. Plunkett has his maiden IPL wicket. An offcutter around off, Rahul tries to scoop the ball over short fine leg, but the ball hits the top third of the bat, more towards the splice. The ball carries low to Avesh at short fine leg, he dives in front and takes a good, low catch."
4.2,"Plunkett to Rahul, FOUR runs","mis-timed but still four. A slower delivery around off, Rahul mis-times an attempted lofted drive, the ball skews off the inside half, plonks over mid-on and races away."
4.1,"Plunkett to Agarwal, 1 run","full, on middle and leg, worked away to midwicket"
3.6,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, no run","yikes, Rahul will be unhappy with the execution. A slower delivery, back of a length and wide outside off. Rahul tries to ramp the ball over short third man, but cannot connect."
3.5,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, no run","a good length delivery on middle and leg, punched back towards mid-off"
3.4,"Avesh Khan to Agarwal, 1 run","back of a length outside off, guided away to deep point"
3.3,"Avesh Khan to Agarwal, FOUR runs","gives himself some room and crashes a punchy drive through cover. Not a bad delivery, good length on middle and leg, smashed on the up"
3.2,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, 1 run","a slower delivery this time, but still a touch short. Rahul nails his pull to deep square leg, on the bounce."
3.1,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, SIX runs","flies for six! A short delivery down leg, plenty of pace on that, but all Rahul needs to do is use that pace. He gets inside the line and helps the errant delivery over fine leg for six. A flat six."
2.6,"Boult to Agarwal, no run","134 kph, back of a length outside off, Boult's angle brings that back to off. Chopped to the keeper, cramped for room"
2.5,"Boult to Rahul, 1 run","139 kph, a low full toss on leg, worked down to fine leg for a run."
2.4,"Boult to Rahul, FOUR runs","a very wide slower offcutter is bunted over cover point. Would have been wide had Rahul let that go, but he goes after it and toe-ends the ball over the infield."
2.3,"Boult to Agarwal, 1 run","full and swinging in, pushed to mid-off with the full face for a run"
2.2,"Boult to Agarwal, FOUR runs","oh yes, that's a much better shot. Good length outside off, Agarwal knows there's pace, there's width and there's an opportunity. All he does is open the bat face and guide the ball to the left of backward point"
2.1,"Boult to Agarwal, FOUR runs","flayed away for four through point. Full and wide, the ball is too wide, allows Agarwal to throw his hands at that, sliced away."
1.6,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, FOUR runs","no one there at fine leg. The first boundary of the night. Full around middle and leg, there may have been some seam movement back in. A thick inside edge flies down to the fine leg fence. The fielder was more towards square leg, flies away."
1.5,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, no run","more pace, more bounce, skiddy. 143 kph, back of a length outside off, Rahul misses an open-faced dab"
1.4,"Avesh Khan to Agarwal, 1 run","full, on the pads, nudged away to deep backward square leg for a single."
1.3,"Avesh Khan to Finch, OUT","another one that hurries the batsman! This is a batsman brought up in Victoria. A 148.7kph short delivery outside off, Finch this time, looks for the pull through midwicket, but he is too late on the shot. Takes the splice of the bat and lobs to cover. Clearly, harried for pace and Avesh strikes. Some pace and bounce in this surface."
1.2,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, 1 run","that's well played. Back of a length outside off, chopped away down to third man for a run."
1.1,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, no run","hurried for pace? 142 kph, back of a length outside off. Rahul wants to pull but is nowhere near the shot. The ball splices to mid-on, doesn't carry"
0.6,"Boult to Finch, no run","well bowled. Back of a length, moves back in after pitching. Finch, like you do in backyard cricket, intentionally avoids the ball by arching his body. But the ball goes over leg stump."
0.5,"Boult to Finch, 2 runs","into the gap at cover for two! Full outside off, Finch pushes a drive through cover for a couple. Gambhir again races after it. Not great timing."
0.4,"Boult to Rahul, 1 run","nicely bowled again. Full and moving back in, pushed to mid-on with the angle. Calls for, and makes the single, easily."
0.3,"Boult to Finch, 1 leg bye","some swing there! Back of a length on middle and leg, the ball moving back in. Pings off the thigh pad down to fine leg"
0.2,"Boult to Rahul, 1 run","Gambhir with the dive! A fullish delivery slightly wide outside off is pushed away towards cover point. Gambhir dives to his right and stops the ball from going through, but Kings XI are off"
0.1,"Boult to Rahul, no run",
19.4,"Pandya to Gowtham, SIX runs","Gowtham conquers Jaipur! Short outside off, and the batsman stays on the back foot to pull it towards the leg side. Off the bat's sweet spot and the ball soars over the mid-wicket boundary. Royals win by three wickets"
19.3,"Pandya to Gowtham, no run","overpitched on off stump, and that's been drilled to cover. Unadkat's halfway down the wicket, but Gowtham sends him back. Will this hurt Royals?"
19.2,"Pandya to Gowtham, FOUR runs","ramped over short third man! It's full outside off, and Gowtham gets down on one knee, opens the bat's face, and sends it over the infield. The Royals camp erupts!"
19.1,"Pandya to Archer, OUT","goes short outside off, and Archer's pull takes the top edge! Hardik gets under it, and manages to keep his composure"
18.6,"Bumrah to Gowtham, FOUR runs","full on off stump, and Gowtham's leg-side heave comes off the bat's inside edge. That means the shot goes behind square, and that means into the gap. Finds the backward square boundary. Eighteen off the over"
18.5,"Bumrah to Gowtham, no run","takes the pace off! Full, and super slow outside off. Gowtham tries to slog this over Bumrah's head, and ends up missing completely"
18.4,"Bumrah to Gowtham, FOUR runs","slapped with disdain! Good length, but wide enough outside off to cut it furiously hard. Gowtham winds up and then pumps this past backward point"
18.3,"Bumrah to Gowtham, 2 runs","full toss on leg stump, and he's cramped for room. Hits his bat and trickles away towards mid-wicket. No one there, so that means Archer asks Gowtham to come for the second"
18.3,"Bumrah to Archer, (no ball) 1 run","slower ball full outside off, and that's been crunched over the non-striker's head. Pollard's there in the deep, but oh dear, it's a no-ball!"
18.2,"Bumrah to Archer, 2 runs","full on off stump, and that's been smothered off his pads to wide long on. Chase for Pollard in the deep"
18.1,"Bumrah to Archer, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and Archer has the power to slap this very square! Played wide enough of deep extra cover, and the outfielder can't pull it back"
17.6,"Mustafizur to Gowtham, FOUR runs","full outside off, and the drive finds the bat's toe end. Flies past Kishan's right and through to the third-man boundary. The equation: 28 runs off 12 balls"
17.5,"Mustafizur to Gowtham, SIX runs","good length on middle stump, and in his arc. Backs away and muscles this towards the leg side. Enough behind that shot to take it beyond long on. Rohit's not happy"
17.4,"Mustafizur to Gowtham, 2 runs","good length on off, and angling away from Gowtham. He tries to slog it over cover, but sliced over the infield. Lands in no man's land"
17.3,"Mustafizur to Archer, 1 run","holes out and long on, but it's a free hit. Full toss on leg stump, and thumped over Fizz's head"
17.3,"Mustafizur to Archer, (no ball)","awry! Super-high full toss outside off, and goes to Kishan on the full! Passed Archer from over his head. Fizz apologises right away"
17.2,"Mustafizur to Gowtham, 1 run","good length on middle stump, but the extra bounce doesn't bother the tall Gowtham. Flat-batted over Fizz's head to Pollard at long on"
17.1,"Mustafizur to Klaasen, OUT","diving catch from Kishan! Angling away from Klaasen, and he tries to punch away from his body. The offcutter goees across Klaasen, and therefore takes the outside edge. Kishan's forced to dive diagonally forward but he's safe with the gloves. Three wickets in six balls "
16.6,"Bumrah to Archer, no run","yorker on off stump, and that's been dug back to Bumrah. He's forced to stick his hand up and the ball sticks! Excellent over"
16.5,"Bumrah to Archer, no run","yorker just outside off stump, and Archer can't carve this away. Bounces behind the stumps and goes through to Kishan's gloves. This is classic Bumrah"
16.4,"Bumrah to Archer, no run","no he won't. Full on off stump, but Archer does well to get behind the line of the ball, and defend with soft hands"
16.3,"Bumrah to Buttler, OUT","The zing bails light up! Super fast (144kph) on off stump and angling right into Buttler. He tries to defend it straight, but the ball goes between bat and pad. Crashes into middle stump"
16.2,"Bumrah to Samson, OUT","holes out to deep midwicket! Is that the end for Royals? Full on off, and to be honest, in Samson's arc. The slower delivery does the trick though, and finds the toe end of Samson's bat. In the air for ages, but too simple for Hardik"
16.1,"Bumrah to Buttler, 1 run","short and wide outside off, and Buttler can free his arms. Slaps this past the infield to the man in the deep"
15.6,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run","quick ball! Full on off stump, and that's been dug away down the ground. Hardik's at long on"
15.5,"Krunal to Buttler, no run","good length on leg stump, and angling into Buttler. He tries to back away to make some extra room, but Krunal follows him. Can't cut it away"
15.4,"Krunal to Samson, 1 run","good length outside off, and it's been driven away from his body. Man at deep extra cover though"
15.3,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and punched to wide long on"
15.2,"Krunal to Samson, 1 run","full on off, but turned off his pads towards midwicket. They collect the single on offer"
15.1,"Krunal to Samson, 2 runs","good length on off, and spinning across Samson. Pushed to long off with soft hands, and that's fifty for Samson!"
14.6,"Pandya to Buttler, 2 runs","full outside off, and enough width to drive past extra cover. Chase for Duminy in the deep, and his throw is not good. Allows Samson to steal a second run"
14.5,"Pandya to Buttler, no run","full just outside off, and Buttler's through with his drive too early. Slices it, but just short of Markande at point"
14.4,"Pandya to Samson, 1 run","good length just outside off, but Hardik takes the pace off. Tries to drive towards cover, but takes the inside edge towards midwicket"
14.3,"Pandya to Samson, FOUR runs","there's the orange cap! Good length on off, and angling into Samson's body. Waits on the backfoot, and pulls this - along the ground - to wide long on. Man there in the deep, but he's just a spectator"
14.2,"Pandya to Buttler, 1 run","full outside off, and comfortably driven to deep extra cover. He'll get off the mark"
14.1,"Pandya to Stokes, OUT","yorker on leg stump! Stokes shuffled across to the off side to try and clip it off his toes, but misses. Tried to take advantage of short fine-leg being inside the circle, but Hardik went wicket-to-wicket"
13.6,"Mustafizur to Samson, no run","full toss outside off, but Samson can't put it away. Drives it off the bat's top-half, and goes only to cover"

13.4,"Mustafizur to Samson, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and that's been beautifully pulled off the back foot. Will only early him a single"
13.3,"Mustafizur to Stokes, 1 run","Stokes comes down the wicket, and therefore it's a low full toss on off. Driven towards wide long off"
13.2,"Mustafizur to Stokes, FOUR runs","connects this time! Short and wide outside off, and that allows Stokes to free his arms. Shifts his body-weight towards the front foot, and then thumps it - flat-batted, really - over cover"
13.1,"Mustafizur to Stokes, 2 runs","just over Markande at point! Was that the wicket Mumbai needed? Back of a length outside off, and just some extra bounce this time. He tried to crunch this over cover, but eventually slices it over the infield. Lucky"
12.6,"Bumrah to Samson, no run","low full toss on middle stump, and that's been blocked back to Bumrah. Straight back to the bowler, who thinks about having a shy at the stumps. Surprised Samson there"
12.5,"Bumrah to Samson, 2 runs","good length on middle stump, and angling into Samson. He punches it off the back foot past midwicket to the man in the deep. Two more. Also the team hundred"
12.4,"Bumrah to Stokes, 1 run","slower ball, full on off stump. Drilled to Hardik at mid off"
12.3,"Bumrah to Stokes, no run","good length on middle and going across Stokes. He tries to ramp it over short fine leg, but then tries to ramp it over short third man. Eventually connects with neither"
12.2,"Bumrah to Samson, 1 run","good length just outside off, and Samson rides the bounce to punch it past cover to the man in the deep"
12.1,"Bumrah to Stokes, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and cramping Stokes for room. Pushed down the ground to long off for a quick single"
11.6,"Krunal to Samson, 2 runs","good length on off, and slightly turning away from Stokes. He punches it towards wide long on, and pushes Samson to complete the second"
11.5,"Krunal to Samson, 2 runs","full on off stump, and smothered with the spin towards the leg side. Calls early for the second, and they manage to complete it. Just about"
11.4,"Krunal to Stokes, 1 run","full and wide outside off, and the batsman takes a step towards the off-side and slaps it to the man in the deep"
11.4,"Krunal to Stokes, 1 wide","loopy, but outside off stump. Stokes is happy to let it go for more extras"
11.3,"Krunal to Stokes, no run","overpitched just outside off, and Stokes digs it away towards cover. Man there"
11.3,"Krunal to Stokes, 1 wide","good length outside off, but too wide. Slides across Stokes"
11.2,"Krunal to Samson, 1 run","good length on middle, and worked off his hips to square leg"
11.1,"Krunal to Samson, 2 runs","full on middle and leg, and tapped to wide long on. Misfielded in the deep, which allows them to take the second"
10.6,"McClenaghan to Stokes, FOUR runs","drilled past extra cover! Goes full and wide outside off, but Stokes kinda expected it. Backs away to make some extra room and slaps it past the cover-region"
10.5,"McClenaghan to Stokes, SIX runs","super slow mo! very short, but it's 92kph! Stokes swivels, winds up, and thumps it over short fine leg"
10.4,"McClenaghan to Samson, 1 run","good length on middle and leg, and flicked off his pads towards the leg side. Sweeper in the deep"
10.3,"McClenaghan to Samson, 2 runs","drilled towards the leg side, but played softly enough to come back for the second"
10.2,"McClenaghan to Stokes, 1 run","half-tracker on off, but Stokes can't punish it. Pulled, along the ground, to deep midwicket"
10.1,"McClenaghan to Stokes, 2 runs","full, but outside leg stump. Stokes was already down the ground, so all he needs to do is clip it off his toes. Played to fine leg"
9.6,"Pandya to Stokes, 1 run","full on middle and off, but angling across Stokes. Thumped off the backfoot, past the non-striker, to long off"
9.5,"Pandya to Samson, 1 run","full on off, and whipped off his pads to deep backward square. They're happy to deal in singles for now"
9.5,"Pandya to Samson, 1 wide",goes full and wide outside off. Samson shuffles across to the off side but chooses not to play at it. The ump calls it as extras
9.4,"Pandya to Stokes, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and slower on this occasion. Pushed to wide long-on, and Stokes calls nice and early for the run"
9.3,"Pandya to Samson, 1 run","good length just outside off, and angling into Samson. Punched off the backfoot to deep extra cover. These two doing well to rotate the strike"
9.2,"Pandya to Stokes, 1 run","back of a length, but on leg stump. Clipped off Stokes' hips to McClenaghan at deep backward point"
9.1,"Pandya to Samson, 1 run","short on off, and Samson rides the bounce to pull square. Top-edged to fine leg"

8.5,"Markande to Samson, no run","good length outside off, and spinning away from Samson. Stays on the back foot and taps it back to Mayank"
8.4,"Markande to Stokes, 1 run","half-tracker on off, and it's the wrong'un this time. Stokes says on the backfoot and punches to long off"
8.3,"Markande to Stokes, 2 runs",flighted wide outside off and Samson comes down the wicket to drive away from his body. Work for the man at long off
8.2,"Markande to Samson, 1 run","good length outside off, and spinning away from Samson. Carved off the front foot towards deep point"
8.1,"Markande to Samson, no run","tossed up on middle, and it's the topspinner this time. Goes straight through, and fended off the front foot"
7.6,"Mustafizur to Samson, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, Samson opens the bat face and guides the ball to backward point for a run."
7.5,"Mustafizur to Stokes, 1 run","on a length, down leg, worked to deep midwicket for one."
7.4,"Mustafizur to Samson, 1 run","back of a length, but sliding down leg. Worked away into the gap at backward square leg. Fine leg cleans up."
7.3,"Mustafizur to Stokes, 1 run","full outside off, Stokes walks down and pushes to mid-off for a quick single. Almost in sync. Rohit can't prevent one."
7.2,"Mustafizur to Stokes, no run","Stokes walks right across this too. But misses. A good length delivery outside off, Stokes walks across, misses and is struck on the pad! A massive appeal is quickly struck down, but Mumbai want to review. Stokes is well down the pitch, there isn't any bat. Two reds, but the ball is bouncing over the top of off stump. So Mumbai lose their review."
7.1,"Mustafizur to Samson, 1 run","another cutter, full and wide outside off. Driven to deep point for a single"
6.6,"Markande to Samson, 1 run","a googly down leg, would have been wide had he left the ball but he tickles that down to fine leg."
6.5,"Markande to Samson, 2 runs","some flight outside off, Samson drives the ball with the spin to wide long-off, immediately calling for two. Nicely into the gap and two easy"
6.4,"Markande to Stokes, 1 run","tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
6.3,"Markande to Stokes, 2 runs","another cross-batted stroke, the reverse sweep, it's the legbreak on middle and off. Stokes places this nicely through point, all along the ground. A good diving stop from Hardik, running to his right"
6.2,"Markande to Stokes, FOUR runs","slog-swept! The googly outside off, but it doesn't matter because Stokes opts for a cross-batted stroke. A hard sweep past midwicket's right"
6.1,"Markande to Stokes, no run","flat start, on off. No flight. Worked to midwicket with the spin."
5.6,"McClenaghan to Samson, FOUR runs","finds the gap! Another cutter outside off, Samson opens the bat face and guides the ball into the gap between third man and point. Lovely."
5.5,"McClenaghan to Stokes, 1 run","walks right across, worked away to deep square leg for a run."
5.4,"McClenaghan to Rahane, OUT","finds midwicket! The pressure was building and the fielder was pushed to the edge of the circle to protect the over. It's another cutter, around middle and leg. Rahane gets enough bat on a wristy whip, but he picks out midwicket at a comfortable height too. The reverse-cupped hands over his head does the job for Krunal. Rahane gestures that he wanted to hit the ball wider of the fielder, like all batsmen try to do."
5.3,"McClenaghan to Rahane, no run","a length delivery on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket. Another cutter."
5.2,"McClenaghan to Rahane, no run","another slower cutter, 119 kph, carved to backward point. That's quite predictable with third man up"
5.1,"McClenaghan to Rahane, 2 runs","a slower delivery outside off, Rahane opens the bat face and guides the ball to short third man. Bumrah picks up and throws the stumps down at the striker's end, conceding an extra run in the process."
4.6,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","flat on the pads, nudged to square leg for a run. At least a single off every ball, very well played by these two."
4.5,"Krunal to Rahane, FOUR runs","loses patience with those singles and changes the line, goes much fuller and much wider outside off. Rahane crashes a drive through cover for four."
4.4,"Krunal to Samson, 1 run","short, straighter though. Clipped to deep midwicket"
4.3,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","flicked against the spin again. Flat and wide outside off, drag-flicked to mid-on"
4.2,"Krunal to Samson, 1 run","flat and straight, nudged to deep midwicket for one"
4.1,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","slow outside off, some flight, but it isn't full. Very clever delivery. Worked against the spin, to midwicket."
3.6,"Mustafizur to Rahane, 1 run","a good length delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off for a single. A good call from Rahane."
3.5,"Mustafizur to Rahane, no run","another cutter, 125 kph, on middle and leg, worked to midwicket. Tidy over so far."
3.4,"Mustafizur to Samson, 1 run","another cutter, 129 kph, full and wide outside off. Samson strides forward and slices a drive to deep cover"
3.3,"Mustafizur to Samson, FOUR runs","slightly wider outside off, allowing Samson to throw his hands at the ball. Finds the timing and the placement, into the gap at cover."
3.2,"Mustafizur to Samson, no run","another cutter, 125 kph, the ball skews off the outside half of the bat to backward point"
3.1,"Mustafizur to Samson, no run","a good length delivery on off, Samson opens the bat face and finds short third man."
2.6,"Krunal to Rahane, no run","flat on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on. Krunal cuts off that angle by running to his right."
2.5,"Krunal to Samson, 3 runs","he's timed this one! Flat and wide outside off, pushed away through cover for three. Pulled back just inside the boundary."
2.4,"Krunal to Samson, FOUR runs","edged through the vacant slip region for four. A bit of width, flat and wider. A thick edge goes flying away for four. Krunal got some turn on that."
2.3,"Krunal to Samson, no run","a yorker on off, jammed back to the bowler."
2.2,"Krunal to Tripathi, OUT","picks out mid-on! I'm not sure what kind of a shot that was. Flat and straight, Tripathi just chips a drive to mid-on, did he try to go over? Or past him? That does not seem like a very clever shot, did it hold up? Something definitely did happen that resulted in a tame bunt to the fielder. Krunal doesn't care."
2.1,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","starts with a full delivery on middle, driven to mid-on for a quick single."
1.6,"Bumrah to Rahane, 1 run","good stop from McClenaghan. Back of a length outside off, Rahane opens the bat face and guides a dab down to third man for a run."
1.5,"Bumrah to Tripathi, 1 run","strays on the pads, worked away to deep square leg for a single."
1.4,"Bumrah to Tripathi, no run","skiddy. Good length on middle and leg, Tripathi gets behind the line to block."
1.3,"Bumrah to Rahane, 1 run","slightly shorter, Rahane opens the bat face and guides that down to third man for one."
1.2,"Bumrah to Rahane, no run","140 kph, on a length, looking for the top of off. Pushed to mid-on"
1.1,"Bumrah to Tripathi, 1 run","lovely start. A good length delivery on off, the ball pitches and straightens even with his angle. Tripathi is squared up, a thick outside edge goes down to third man."
0.6,"McClenaghan to Tripathi, 1 run","nicely played and stopped. A full delivery on middle and leg, Tripathi drives with the full face, towards mid-off's right. The fielder gets across and cuts the ball off. A slightly sloppy start from Mumbai."
0.5,"McClenaghan to Tripathi, 2 runs",too straight again. A slower one on the pads and Tripathi works the ball through backward square leg for a couple.
0.5,"McClenaghan to Tripathi, 1 wide",not been a great start in terms of line. This one drifts down leg for a wide.
0.4,"McClenaghan to Tripathi, no run","good length delivery around middle and off, tapped towards point. Tripathi hares down, Rahane sends him back in time."
0.3,"McClenaghan to Tripathi, FOUR runs","it's too straight. Full and drifting down leg. All Tripathi needs is a bit of bat, a thick inside edge and the ball flies down to the fine leg fence."
0.2,"McClenaghan to Rahane, 1 run","132 kph, back of a length down leg. Clips the pad down towards short fine leg."
0.1,"McClenaghan to Rahane, no run","nicely bowled. Full and attacking the stumps, Rahane is aware of that wicket-taking option, so a broad bat comes down to defend."
19.6,"Stokes to Pollard, 2 runs","full outside leg, and Pollard whips it fine down the leg side. Misfield in the deep, and that allows them to take the second. Rajasthan Royals need 168 to win"
19.5,"Stokes to Pollard, no run","full outside leg stump, but Pollard expected that. Backs away further towards the leg side and thumps it towards deep midwicket"
19.4,"Stokes to Pollard, FOUR runs","yorker on middle stump, and that's been drilled past the non-striker to long on. Gowtham's dive ends up in vain!"
19.4,"Stokes to Pollard, (no ball)","slipped out of his hand! Eye-line level full toss, but wide outside off. Pollard lets it go. Free hit"
19.3,"Stokes to Pollard, no run","too slow! Pollard winds up for a biggie, but sends it nowhere. Full outside off, but through his shot way too early"
19.2,"Stokes to Pollard, 2 runs","falls just short of cow corner! Short on off, and Pollard mistimed the pull. Was in the air for ages, but Unadkat can't get to it"
19.1,"Stokes to Pollard, no run","yorker on off stump, and that's been dug down the ground. A single's available, but Pollard asks Markande to get back"
18.6,"Archer to Markande, no run","full on leg stump, and that's been clipped off his toes to deep backward square. Single for the taking, but Pollard refuses. The big man wants the strike for the final over"
18.5,"Archer to McClenaghan, OUT","and McClenaghan's out! Comes from around the wicket and this is full on off stump. Almost a yorker, and the batsman can't connect. On a hat-trick"
18.4,"Archer to Pandya, OUT","crashes into middle stump! Full on leg stump, and Hardik tries a leg-side slog. Misses, and the ball hits his pad and then cannons into his stumps"
18.3,"Archer to Pandya, FOUR runs","the umpire's on the floor! Full on off, and that's been thumped down the ground. As straight as you can imagine, and I'm glad Rod Tucker ducked. Goes to the boundary in no time"
18.2,"Archer to Pollard, 1 run","dropped by Archer! Was hit really hard though, but he doesn't show the pain. Smiles it off. Full on off, and Pollard drills it straight to Archer. He managed to get it with both hands, but the ball just pops out. Difficult chance"
18.1,"Archer to Krunal, OUT","full on off, and lifted off his pads towards the leg side. Not hit well enough, and Klaasen - at wide long on - takes an easy catch. Looks like it's the knuckleball that earns Archer the wicket"
17.6,"Unadkat to Pollard, no run","excellent ball to end the over. Gives everything to this delivery and Unadkat takes a tumble on his followthrough. It's full and wide outside off, but inside the tram-lines. A much better spell from Unadkat tonight"
17.5,"Unadkat to Krunal, 1 run","another slower ball, it's the offcutter this time. Krunal wants to work it towards the leg side, but takes the leading edge. Falls near short extra cover"
17.4,"Unadkat to Pollard, 1 run","back of a length on off, and Pollard comfortably pulls it over short fine-leg's head"
17.3,"Unadkat to Pollard, SIX runs","good length on middle, and angling across Pollard. Just enough width to free his arms, and he smacks it over the non-striker's head. Hit well enough!"
17.2,"Unadkat to Krunal, 1 run","slower ball, and full on off. Tapped off his pads towards the vacant mid-wicket region. They want the second, but Samson's quick to get his throw right in"
17.1,"Unadkat to Krunal, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and angling into Krunal. Stays on the back foot, and glances this past short third man. Beats the infield, and no stopping that thereafter!"
16.6,"Archer to Pollard, 1 run","goes back of a length, and takes the pace off it once again. Whipped off his waist to deep square leg"
16.5,"Archer to Krunal, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and Krunal opens his bat's face to glance it towards short third man"
16.4,"Archer to Pollard, 1 run","full on leg stump, and that's been well bowled! Angling into his toes, and it can't be put away"
16.3,"Archer to Pollard, no run","back of a length on off stump, and it's another loopy slower ball. Pollard wants to pull but he's through his shot too early. Hits his arm"
16.2,"Archer to Pollard, no run","goes short! On off stump, and soars over Pollard's head as he's forced to duck"
16.1,"Archer to Pollard, no run","back of a length on off, and Pollard's been deceived by the pace. Defended off the back foot"
15.6,"Unadkat to Krunal, no run","short outside off, and forces Krunal to tip-toe. Chopped towards the keeper"
15.5,"Unadkat to Pollard, 1 run","good length on off, and he opens his bat's face to carve it towards backward point. Calls nice and early this time"
15.4,"Unadkat to Rohit Sharma, OUT","first-ball duck! Full on off, and pushed to cover for a quick single. Rohit calls early, but that's super dangerous. Rahane collects, dives forward, and then throws under-hand. Off go to zing bails, and out goes Rohit!"
15.3,"Unadkat to Pollard, 1 run","slower ball again. Full on middle stump, and driven to long off"
15.2,"Unadkat to Yadav, OUT","slow again, and this time the slog is played way too early. Slices the shot, and it's another skyer. Swirls in the air, but Buttler's very safe"
15.1,"Unadkat to Yadav, no run","starts off with the slower ball. Full outside off, and angling across Yadav. Tries to drive towards cover, but misses"
14.6,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","full toss, wide outside off again. Sky thumps it past the non-striker to long on for a single"
14.6,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 wide","well, we'll find out in a bit. Because it's full and wide outside of again. Forces Suryakumar to reach at it, and he misses, but the umpire stretches his arms out again"
14.6,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 wide",too wide. Overpitched and Suryakumar lets it go through to Buttler
14.5,"Kulkarni to Pollard, 1 run","full toss, but wide outside off. Sticks his bat out and drills it to deep extra cover. He's off the mark. Kulkarni ensuring the ball's not in Pollard's arc"
14.4,"Kulkarni to Pollard, no run",good length just outside off on the fourth-stump line. Pollard takes a step forward and taps it back to the bowler
14.3,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and that's been pulled along the ground to deep midwicket"
14.2,"Kulkarni to Ishan, OUT","too cheeky, and Kishan pays the price. Full toss outside off, and Kishan opens his bat's face to ramp it over the keeper. Doesn't manage to get the angle he wants, and therefore in the air for ages. Buttler collects and finally the partnership ends after almost 14 overs"
14.1,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","full and wide outside off, but that's premeditated by Suryakumar. Gets his front leg across to the off side and then paddles this sweep shot very square on the man in the deep"
13.6,"Unadkat to Ishan, 2 runs","slower ball outside off, but Kishan was waiting for it. Slog-swept to Stokes at wide long on"
13.5,"Unadkat to Ishan, no run","good length outside off, and going straight through. Enough width for Kishan to cut square, but plays under that ball. Through to Buttler"
13.4,"Unadkat to Ishan, no run","full just outside off, and he backs away once again. Drills this drive to cover thereafter"
13.3,"Unadkat to Ishan, FOUR runs","drops just in front of short fine leg! And then goes through Gopal's hands. Full on off, and he shuffled across to the off side to try and ramp it over the leg side. Mistimes it behind square but earns a boundary anyway"
13.2,"Unadkat to Ishan, no run","deceived by the slower ball! Only 120 kph this time, and Kishan misses the leg-side slog. Full outside off, and through to the keeper on the bounce"
13.1,"Unadkat to Ishan, 2 runs","backs away to the leg side, and cuts this good-length ball over point. Excellent from Archer in the deep, who races across the boundary line and collects from deep point"
12.6,"Archer to Yadav, no run","good length on off, and extra bounce! Hits the batsman's gloves, as he tries to defend. That must've stung"
12.5,"Archer to Ishan, 1 run","full toss on off stump, and mistimed off the back foot to mid on. Calls early for the single, and that's his fifty!"
12.4,"Archer to Yadav, 1 run","full on middle stump, and drilled down the ground to long on"
12.3,"Archer to Yadav, 2 runs","deft! Good length outside off, and Sky opens his bat's face to ramp it between the keeper and short third man. Chase for the infielder"
12.2,"Archer to Ishan, 1 run","full toss on middle stump again, and this time it's been bunted towards the leg side. Only to square leg, though"
12.1,"Archer to Ishan, FOUR runs","full toss on off, but Kishan backs away towards the leg side and check-drives over cover! Off the bat's sweet spot and one-bounce and into the extra-cover boundary"
11.6,"Gowtham to Ishan, 1 run","full and wide outside off. Kishan chooses to reverse sweep, but Stokes is there at deep point"
11.5,"Gowtham to Yadav, 1 run","full on off, and that's been whipped down the ground to long on. They easily walk across for the run"
11.4,"Gowtham to Yadav, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and Yadav takes a step towards the leg side and cuts it past point. Beats the infielders and there's no stopping that thereafter"
11.3,"Gowtham to Ishan, 1 run","full on middle stump, and Kishan muscles this drive past the non-striker. Man at long on, though"
11.2,"Gowtham to Yadav, 1 run","good length, just outside off. Stays on the back foot and punches to long off for an easy run"
11.1,"Gowtham to Yadav, no run","full on off, and he tries to drive towards cover. Takes the inside edge and trickles down to short fine leg. Darting throw from the fielder to the non-striker's, but Kishan's safe"
10.6,"Stokes to Ishan, 2 runs","full on off, and Kishan tries another leg-side slog. Inside-edged onto his pads, and goes towards midwicket. No one there, so Stokes has to run across to the leg side. Allows them to take the run"
10.5,"Stokes to Yadav, 1 run",good length but just outside off. Punched off the back foot past Stokes' left to long off
10.4,"Stokes to Yadav, 2 runs","good length outside off, and angling into Yadav. Flat-batted down the ground to long on. Also the hundred partnership"
10.3,"Stokes to Yadav, 2 runs","slower ball, and short on off stump. He's through his pull-shot early, and that's in the air. Straight to Gowtham at long on, but it's been dropped! He's one of the better fielders, but drops it after what looked like a clean catch"
10.2,"Stokes to Yadav, FOUR runs","clipped behind square! Full on middle, and aimed at Sky's pads. Uses his wrists to whip it over the square-leg umpire's head, and beats both men in the deep"
10.1,"Stokes to Yadav, no run","high full toss, but wide outside off. Suryakumar can slap this anywhere he wants, but drills it straight to cover. Was above the waist, mind you, but called a dot"
9.6,"Gopal to Ishan, SIX runs","goes beyond cow corner! Nicely flighted on leg stump, and Kishan uses his feet to get to the pitch of the ball. Proper slog towards the leg side thereafter"
9.5,"Gopal to Ishan, no run","good length on middle, and gets big onto Kishan. Muscled off the back foot towards cover. Not hit into the gap"
9.4,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","good length outside off, and it's the wrong'un to end the over. Comes into Suryakumar's body, and punches it down the ground to long on"
9.3,"Gopal to Yadav, SIX runs","tossed up outside off, and that's a beautiful shot from Sky. Takes one step forward and lifts it over cover. Stylish way to get to fifty"
9.2,"Gopal to Ishan, 1 run","full on leg stump, and Kishan uses his feet to come down the wicket. Driven to long on"
9.1,"Gopal to Ishan, FOUR runs","uses the depth of his crease! Good length on leg stump, and Kishan goes deep into his crease to open the gap behind square on the leg side. Swivels and pulls along the ground to deep backward square"
8.6,"Stokes to Ishan, 1 run","slower ball to end the over. Good length outside off, and Kishan mistimes his cut"
8.5,"Stokes to Yadav, 1 run","good length outside off, but angling into the right-hander. Punched off the front foot to long on for a walking single"
8.4,"Stokes to Yadav, 2 runs","full just outside off, opens his bat's face and carves it to deep point. Calls early for the second, and they comfortably jog back in"
8.3,"Stokes to Ishan, 1 run","full on off, and Kishan comes down the wicket. Effectively yorks himself, so all he can do is bunt it down the ground to long off"
8.2,"Stokes to Ishan, SIX runs","nataraja pull! Good length on middle, and he's quick to swivel, get his front leg up, and then muscled over square leg"
8.1,"Stokes to Ishan, no run","good length on middle and angling into Kishan. Tries to whip it off his pads, but hits his thigh guard"
7.6,"Gopal to Ishan, 1 run","aargh, it's short again. That's a poor over. Googly outside off, Kishan rocks back and nails his pull to wide long-on for a run."
7.5,"Gopal to Ishan, 2 runs","it's a googly, on middle and leg, pulled to deep square leg. Two more."
7.4,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","pulled away to deep square leg, it's short again."
7.3,"Gopal to Yadav, FOUR runs","it's too short again. A long hop, Suryakumar Yadav hurries back and swats a pull into the gap at midwicket for four. Archer gets across to his left, but allows the ball to go through. Naughtily"
7.3,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 wide","looking for the seam-up one, 115 kph. Waaaay down leg. Buttler does well to prevent five wides."
7.2,"Gopal to Yadav, 2 runs","a tad short, Suryakumar Yadav picks the length early, hurries back and swats a pull into the gap at midwicket for two."
7.1,"Gopal to Ishan, 1 run","a bit of flight on leg, Kishan stays low and nails his sweep to deep midwicket for one, all along the ground."
6.6,"Gowtham to Yadav, FOUR runs",connects this time. It's the same trajectory - flat and quick - and Suryakumar Yadav sweeps that easily through  backward square leg for four. Just had to get some bat on that.
6.5,"Gowtham to Yadav, no run","101 kph, a flat and quick dart. Suryakumar looks to drag a sweep but it's too full. Struck on the pad, well outside the line of off stump!"
6.4,"Gowtham to Ishan, 1 run","flat on middle and leg, flicked away towards square leg for a run."
6.3,"Gowtham to Yadav, 1 run","flat on middle and leg, punched to long-on for a single."
6.2,"Gowtham to Yadav, 2 runs","flat on off, but he gets some turn. That's why an attempted drive results in a thick inside edge through square leg. Two runs"
6.1,"Gowtham to Ishan, 1 run","flat on middle and leg, punched to long-on from the back foot."
5.6,"Unadkat to Ishan, 1 run","a good length delivery on off, pushed to long-on for a single. A good comeback from Mumbai after a slow start."
5.5,"Unadkat to Yadav, 1 run","a full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off for a run. They've got the boundary so the singles make it a productive over."
5.4,"Unadkat to Ishan, 1 run","a slower cutter on off, 119 kph, sliced in front of point for one. Wanted one all along"
5.3,"Unadkat to Ishan, no run","good length on middle and leg, jammed out back towards the bowler."
5.2,"Unadkat to Yadav, 1 run","a slower ball on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on. Suryakumar called for one immediately (it was his call). Kishan doesn't completely trust the call, there's some hesitation but even with a direct hit at the batsman's end, all good."
5.1,"Unadkat to Yadav, FOUR runs",all wrists again! What batting. Back of a length on the fourth-stump channel. Suryakumar stays low and whips this elegantly through midwicket. Beautiful
4.6,"Kulkarni to Ishan, FOUR runs",that's not great bowling. It's short and wide with third man in. Kishan slices a cut between short third man and backward point. Too easy. Poor over that one. One too many from Rahane.
4.5,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","full on middle and leg, driven to long-on for a run."
4.4,"Kulkarni to Yadav, SIX runs","what a shot! All wrists. Full and straight, Suryakumar brings out the wrists, stays besides the ball and flicks, the ball then flies away over backward square leg. Lovely batting."
4.3,"Kulkarni to Ishan, 1 run","full and wide outside off, hammered to the sweeper cover for a single. Quick hands through the line of the ball."
4.2,"Kulkarni to Ishan, SIX runs","that's smashed! 116 kph offcutter on middle and leg. Kishan comes charging and swipes a heave into the stands over long-on. The bat turned in his hands, but still plenty of power."
4.1,"Kulkarni to Ishan, no run","a full delivery outside off, nicely driven with the full face to mid-off. Decent timing too."
3.6,"Archer to Yadav, no run","full delivery outside off, 145 kph. Skewed away to mid-on. Another good over for Rajasthan."
3.5,"Archer to Yadav, FOUR runs","145 kph, doesn't miss out this time. Back of a length on middle and leg, makes contact with his flick this time and the ball goes flying past short fine leg's left."
3.4,"Archer to Yadav, no run","looking to drag a flick, but the ball has smashed Suryakumar on the box! That's going to hurt for a little bit. Back of a length on middle and off, 142 kph. Suryakumar misses and wears the blow."
3.3,"Archer to Ishan, 1 run","nicely done. Good length delivery in the fourth-stump channel, tapped towards point for a run. A direct hit from Gowtham at the bowler's end, but he's well in. Good cricket"
3.2,"Archer to Ishan, no run","141 kph. Again, hurried on the pull. Short of a length outside off, Kishan drags a mis-timed pull to midwicket."
3.1,"Archer to Yadav, 1 leg bye","a good length delivery, straying down leg. Off the thigh pad down to short fine leg."
2.6,"Kulkarni to Ishan, no run","looking for the gap either side of short third man, but he finds the fielder! Full and wide, dabbed away towards short third man."
2.5,"Kulkarni to Ishan, no run","a slower ball outside off, good change in pace, and angle (the ball going away instead of coming in). Pushed to cover point."
2.4,"Kulkarni to Ishan, no run","just short of midwicket! It's 138 kph, hurrying Kishan for pace. He looks to pull, but all he can manage is to splice it away."
2.3,"Kulkarni to Ishan, no run","full on off, 135 kph, blocked to mid-off. The little bit of swing we saw in the first over isn't there anymore."
2.2,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","the line isn't great, drifts down leg, worked to deep square leg for one."
2.1,"Kulkarni to Yadav, SIX runs","a clean swing into the stands! Full, on middle and leg. Suryakumar showed the strength of his wrists in the previous one. Now, he lifts the ball cleanly over mid-on for six. Shot."
1.6,"Gowtham to Yadav, 1 run","flat and quick on middle and leg, pushed to long-on for one. Another tidy over."
1.5,"Gowtham to Yadav, no run","flat outside off, a big extravagant swing, but the drift takes the ball past the outside edge."
1.4,"Gowtham to Yadav, no run","it's flat and quick outside off, pushed to mid-off, not much power or timing with that"
1.3,"Gowtham to Ishan, 1 run","flat on middle and leg, nudged into the gap at midwicket for a run. Nicely played, soft hands, off the mark."
1.2,"Gowtham to Yadav, 1 run","short and quick outside off, punched away to cover where there is another misfield. Another single."
1.1,"Gowtham to Yadav, no run","it's short and quick down leg, flicked away with strong wrists to square leg. Finds the fielder"
0.6,"Kulkarni to Ishan, no run","full outside off, pushed to cover. A lovely start from Dhawal."
0.5,"Kulkarni to Ishan, no run","140 kph, full and swinging back in, Kishan gets forward and somehow defends. It's a similar delivery to what Umesh bowled to him at the Wankhede."
0.4,"Kulkarni to Lewis, OUT","a golden duck for Lewis this time! It's an overpitched half-volley outside off and Lewis wants to flay that through cover. It's the right stroke and the right plan, but downright awful execution. His feet are rooted to the crease, he doesn't account for the little bit of inswing, despite watching it from the other end. A thick inside edge clatters into the stumps."
0.3,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","off the mark via a misfield. Back of a length on middle and leg, swivel-pulled away towards square leg. Gowtham can't field cleanly, allowing the first run of the night."
0.2,"Kulkarni to Yadav, no run","more swing. Not too much, not too troubling. Good length delivery outside off, sixth-stump line. Defended into the off side, towards cover."
0.1,"Kulkarni to Yadav, no run","tidy start from Dhawal. On a length, around middle, some away shape. Defended to mid-on. No golden duck this time."
19.6,"Bravo to Rashid Khan, 1 run","oh, he's done it! Bravo's done it. A yorker outside off that Rashid can only drill down to long-on. Bravo takes flight. So close yet so far for Sunrisers"
19.5,"Bravo to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs",slashes blindly at a wide fuller one and gets an outside edge that gets well past the left of short third man. Six off one!
19.4,"Bravo to Rashid Khan, SIX runs","oh, yes! Another big hit. Bravo sprays a short ball that's angled into him, and Rashid swivels and heaves a pull over deep backward square leg. What a strike! What drama!"
19.3,"Bravo to Saha, 1 run","full toss on middle, turned away to deep fine leg where there's  a fielder guarding the boundary"
19.2,"Bravo to Saha, 2 runs","low full toss, driven to extra cover, where Shardul Thakur lets it go through the legs. What a time for a misfield. Two extra runs!"
19.1,"Bravo to Saha, no run","that's the class and experience of Bravo at this stage of the innings. A wide yorker, sneaks under the bat. CSK need five more of these from him"
18.6,"Thakur to Rashid Khan, SIX runs","Rashid Khan reminding people that he's still here, and as long as he is, write off SRH at your own peril. This one's a fuller one outside off, right in the slot, and just what the newcomer wanted. Frees up his arms and shellacks it straight over"
18.5,"Thakur to Saha, 1 run","slower length ball, flays a pull straight to deep midwicket"
18.4,"Thakur to Pathan, OUT","gone, Yusuf's gone! The task was just too much. He had to go for it, and he's picked out extra cover. The knuckle ball. CSK's variations at the death have been nothing short of remarkable here. Yusuf slashes and gets the leading edge as Raina settles under it"
18.3,"Thakur to Pathan, no run","full toss again, wants the wide yorker, fortunately for him, this is drilled straight back at him"
18.2,"Thakur to Pathan, SIX runs","full toss, the yorker gone wrong. You can't get an inch wrong here or you'll be punished. Yusuf whips it over deep midwicket. Oh, how the scales have tilted back and forth!"
18.1,"Thakur to Saha, 1 run","another slower ball, full, drilled away to long-off. Hands the strike back to Yusuf"
17.6,"Bravo to Williamson, OUT","in the air and taken! Is that the match? Jadeja with a brilliant catch. Bravo slows it up, rolls his fingers on this back of a length delivery, and miscues the pull in the air. Jadeja charges forward and puts in a perfectly-timed dive forward to complete an amazing catch. CSK back in this. Remember, Yusuf is not at 100 percent"
17.5,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 run","yorker on middle, flicked out to the square leg region. Well-bowled"
17.4,"Bravo to Pathan, 2 runs","short outside off, tries to fetch a pull and drags it down the ground between long-on and long-off"
17.3,"Bravo to Pathan, 2 runs","another yorker, this one's angled into him, and Yusuf trickles it away to short fine who dives and can't stop it. Man in the deep throws it to Dhoni who flicks it back onto the stumps without even looking at them. But Yusuf desperately puts in a dive to save his wicket. Has he done damage to his back in doing that, however? He's down in significant pain again"
17.2,"Bravo to Pathan, no run","wide yorker outside off, dug out back to the bowler"
17.1,"Bravo to Pathan, FOUR runs","short, banged into him, that's tripe from Bravo. Yusuf swivels and helps this pull along to deep fine leg"
16.6,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","beautifully bowled! Top stuff under pressure from the young quick. A very wide yorker again, and Williamson can do nothing about it apart from jamming the bat down and hitting the ground"
16.5,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","very full outside off, Williamson walks across early and then ends up wearing it on the pad as the ball rolls away to short fine leg"
16.4,"Thakur to Pathan, 1 run","there you go, that's what CSK need. A yorker outside off, squeezed away through point"
16.3,"Thakur to Pathan, SIX runs","gets the yorker wrong and fires a full toss on Yusuf's off-stump, and he's whacked that out of here. Miles past long-on"
16.2,"Thakur to Williamson, 1 run","is that a high full toss? No, umpires seem to think it's fine but that was definitely a no-ball. Williamson can't believe it. Vineet Kulkarni at square leg. Williamson works it away to backward square leg without control"
16.1,"Thakur to Williamson, 2 runs",walks across but it's a yorker outside off that's been dug out to deep point
15.6,"Bravo to Pathan, SIX runs","six more! Another big over, and the Hyderabad crowd has found its voice again. A shortish delivery again, and Yusuf hammers a pull over deep midwicket. Another clean strike"
15.5,"Bravo to Pathan, no run","length ball, slid across, Yusuf swings and misses as it's the slower one. Well-concealed"
15.4,"Bravo to Pathan, SIX runs","not the best timing but he has enough power to make up for it. A wide fuller one, smoked over long-off. CSK feeling the heat now"
15.3,"Bravo to Pathan, no run","short ball, goes over leg stump as the batsman ducks, deemed alright by the umpire"
15.2,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball with ample width, slapped away to point"
15.1,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 run","short of a length, slower, flays a pull one-bounce to deep square leg"
14.6,"Karn to Williamson, SIX runs","that's another gift from the bowler. Changes the line and takes it away from the batsman's off-stump, but the length is the same. Williamson easily comes forward to get his weight behind that shot, and deposits it over long-off with minimal effort. Massive over; 22 off it. Game on in Hyderabad"
14.5,"Karn to Williamson, SIX runs","that's six more! This is an unbelievable innings from the SRH captain. A poor delivery - leg-side fuller one from the leggie, and Williamson gets down on one knee and carts it over deep square leg"
14.4,"Karn to Pathan, 1 run","short, wide, and flat, slapped over the in-field, on the bounce to sweeper cover"
14.3,"Karn to Williamson, 1 run","short and wide, reaches out for a cut to deep point"
14.2,"Karn to Williamson, SIX runs",that's an even better shot. Williamson's turning it around here. Still giving SRH some hope. Gets on top of this fuller one and mows it over cow corner
14.1,"Karn to Williamson, 2 runs",in the air as he tries to loft this fuller one and lands safely in front of long-off
13.6,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run",
13.5,"Jadeja to Williamson, SIX runs","heaved away! That's a top shot. Jadeja flattens his trajectory and takes this away from Williamson, but the batsman swings cleanly and with loads of timing to eaisly clear long-off"
13.4,"Jadeja to Williamson, no run","length outside off, stays in the crease and punches to extra cover"
13.3,"Jadeja to Pathan, 1 run","fullish, sliding into middle and leg, pushed down the ground to long-on"
13.3,"Jadeja to Pathan, 1 wide","flat and quick and well outside off, Yusuf can't reach out"
13.2,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","short and wide, cut to deep point again"
13.1,"Jadeja to Pathan, 1 run","short of a length, sliding into him, backs away and cuts to deep point"
12.6,"Karn to Pathan, 1 run",nudges this length ball into the leg side and Yusuf is struggling with his back as he limps the single
12.5,"Karn to Pathan, 2 runs","he's not able to deal with the spin again, and throws hard hands at this fuller one, off the outside of the bat, but lands past the point fielder running back"
12.4,"Karn to Williamson, 1 run",covers for the turn and pushes into the off side
12.3,"Karn to Pathan, 1 run",in the air and Bravo makes no attempt. Another top-edge on the sweep and Bravo runs forward before bailing off in the last minute. Misjudgement
12.2,"Karn to Pathan, no run",gets down for a sweep and skews it in the air as it deflects off the edge onto his arm before lobbing into the air in the off side
12.1,"Karn to Williamson, 1 run",advances down the ground and drives to long-off for his sixth IPL fifty
11.6,"Jadeja to Pathan, no run",slides into him and finds the inside part of the bat as he pushes back
11.5,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, straightening on middle, backs away and punches through cover"
11.4,"Jadeja to Pathan, 1 run",gently pushes a fullish delivery into the off side for one
11.3,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run",whipped against the turn between midwicket and mid-on
11.2,"Jadeja to Pathan, 1 run","pushes forward early into a length ball and chips a punch in the air, towards long-on"
11.1,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","short and wide, and some turn away again, cut away to deep point"
10.6,"Karn to Williamson, 1 run","floated up outside off, clipped to midwicket"
10.5,"Karn to Pathan, 1 run","non-turning legbreak on middle, trickles it away into the leg side"
10.4,"Karn to Pathan, no run","big swing and a miss from Yusuf. Zero feet, and against the turn and angle. Dhoni whips the bails off in a flash, and wait, has the backfoot been planted back? Yusuf just dragged it out but he's managed to ground his foot just in time"
10.3,"Karn to Shakib, OUT","there's the error from the batsman. Pressure building up, and he's forced into a poor shot - a sweep with no room, and he gets a glove to short fine leg"
10.2,"Karn to Shakib, no run","floated up on middle, driven straight back"
10.1,"Karn to Shakib, no run",backs away dangerously to one that spins in and gets an outside edge to short third man
9.6,"Watson to Shakib, 1 run","slower full ball at 129.7ks on leg stump, pushed away between mid-on and midwicket"
9.5,"Watson to Shakib, 2 runs","good fielding again. Full and wide, and Shakib drove it to the right of extra cover, where DJ bravo dives and half-stops it"
9.4,"Watson to Williamson, 1 run","short outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
9.3,"Watson to Williamson, 2 runs",
9.2,"Watson to Williamson, 4 runs","Jadeja with a brilliant save but have theu run four? Yes, they have. Williamson whipped this uppishly through deep midwicket. Jadeja ran across a long way from deep square leg and did well to get down to it but ended up pulling it away too forcefully. He then has to chase it a second time as it goes towards the boundary again. And Faf du Plessis, backing up, had to pick it up in the end"
9.1,"Watson to Shakib, 1 run","full on the pads, flicked away to deep midwicket"
8.6,"Jadeja to Shakib, 1 run","short and pushed a long way across, slapped away to sweeper cover"
8.5,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, spinning away towards off, whipped down to long-on"
8.4,"Jadeja to Williamson, 2 runs",cut off the backfoot through backward point. Intercepted by the man at the deep
8.3,"Jadeja to Williamson, no run",pushed back to the bowler
8.2,"Jadeja to Williamson, FOUR runs","a pristine late cut from Williamson. He's played some delightful strokes today, and that's as good as any. Short of a length from Jadeja, straightens around off, and Williamson stays back and cuts late through backward point"
8.1,"Jadeja to Shakib, 1 run",gets down for a big crunching sweep and mistimes it to deep midwicket
7.6,"Chahar to Shakib, 1 run","short of a length, flicked with the angle to midwicket"
7.5,"Chahar to Shakib, FOUR runs",shot! This one was short and came with a bit too much width. Shakib jumps and flays an upper cut over backward point
7.4,"Chahar to Shakib, no run",flays a drive to a fuller ball but cover dives to his left and makes a brilliant stop
7.3,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run","slower fullish ball, punched to sweeper cover"
7.2,"Chahar to Shakib, 1 run","shortish outside off, whacks it away to deep backward point"
7.1,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run","a beautiful drive for one as extra cover dives and gets a hand to it, and long-off mops up"
6.6,"Jadeja to Shakib, no run","a bit of width, opens up and drops it to point"
6.5,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","lower-arm slider this time, worked with the angle to the region between midwicket and mid-on"

6.1,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","length ball, little turn, shifts back and across and whips against the turn to midwicket"
5.6,"Watson to Shakib, SIX runs","short, pitching outside leg, that's a gift, and Shakib treats it as one as he swivels around and pulls it over fine leg"
5.5,"Watson to Shakib, no run","full and wide, Shakib reaches out for a drive that's intercepted by Billings diving to his left at point"
5.4,"Watson to Williamson, 1 run",gets on top of a shortish delivery and whips it to midwicket
5.3,"Watson to Shakib, 1 run","back of a length, pulls it away towards midwicket and sets off for a quick single. Direct hit at the striker's end but Williamson has dragged his bat well inside"
5.2,"Watson to Shakib, FOUR runs","slower short ball, Shakib doesn't get hold of it but finds the gap at midwicket"
5.1,"Watson to Shakib, no run","back of a length on middle and off, punched to mid-off"
4.6,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","short of a length, gets on top and drops it in front of cover. Wants a single but is sent back"
4.5,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","mistimes his pull this time, an inside edge as it drops into the off side off the lower part of the bat"
4.4,"Chahar to Williamson, SIX runs","short, angled into Williamson, and he's waiting for it right back in the crease before flaying a pull flat over deep square leg"
4.3,"Chahar to Williamson, no run","slow and dipping full toss, Williamson leans into a punch and Billings flings himself across at cover to make a brilliant save"
4.2,"Chahar to Hooda, OUT",easy catch at extra cover. Hooda pre-meditates and shuffles too early. It's the slower ball again and he goes through with the flick early to get a leading edge that Jadeja runs back a few inches to take
4.1,"Chahar to Hooda, no run","short of a length outside off, whips it towards midwicket who dives forward and stops it"
3.6,"Thakur to Williamson, FOUR runs","back of a length, sitting up nicely outside off. Was the slower one from the bowler, and Williamson rocks back and crunches a pull over midwicket"
3.5,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","short of a length, sways out of the line outside off"
3.4,"Thakur to Williamson, FOUR runs",splits the gap at midwicket as he pulls this back of a length delivery. DJ Bravo sprints behind it but the ball's too quick for him
3.3,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","short of a length, slower in pace, left alone outside off"
3.2,"Thakur to Hooda, 1 run",
3.1,"Thakur to Williamson, 1 run","what an effort! That's a sensational effort! Karn Sharma at the third man boundary with a super piece of fielding. Leaps right up in the air after Williamson upper-cut this, and stretches out his right hand. Sees his left foot landing outside the boundary, and just as he's landing down, he releases it after completing the catch. Would have probably been on par with Boult's catch last night had he got that but top effort"
3.1,"Thakur to Williamson, 1 wide",tails away down the leg side
2.6,"Chahar to Hooda, no run","short outside off, Hooda was walking towards it and is then forced to sway out of the line late"
2.5,"Chahar to Hooda, no run","short of a length outside off, rides the bounce and drops it in front of backward point"
2.4,"Chahar to Hooda, no run",shuffles across early and tries to tuck this back of a length delivery but gets an inside edge into the pad before it rolls away into the off side
2.3,"Chahar to Hooda, no run","full, wide, holding its line this time, and Hooda walks across and lets it go"
2.2,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run","full, curving away, worked away to third man"
2.1,"Chahar to Pandey, OUT","Deepak Chahar, what a star! Again some very sharp movement outside off, the away-swinger. Pandey, no feet, throws his hands at it, and gets a healthy outside edge that third man runs forward to grab. Poor shot, and Sunrisers in big trouble"
1.6,"Thakur to Williamson, FOUR runs","short of a length outside off, Williamson cuts crisply off the backfoot past point"
1.5,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","full and shaping away, Williamson drives back with some tight footwork back to the bowler"
1.4,"Thakur to Williamson, FOUR runs","short, wide, through cover and point this time as he gets on top of the bounce and slaps it away"
1.3,"Thakur to Williamson, no run",
1.2,"Thakur to Williamson, 2 runs","short and wide, Williamson dares to go over the in-field and just about clears the point fielder. And, oh, that's some great teamwork at the boundary. Two fielders - Rayudu and Karn Sharma converging - Rayudu slides forward and Karn, running across, gets the boot across to push it back and Rayudu does well to avoid contact as he completes the slide"
1.1,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","short of a length, shapes away outside off, rides the bounce and drops it to point"
0.6,"Chahar to Pandey, no run",sharp inswinger! Curves in significantly and raps the pad but would have headed down leg with that angle. Wicket maiden from the young fast bowler. What a start!
0.5,"Chahar to Bhui, OUT","edged and taken! This is lovely bowling. Set him up perfectly for this dismissal. First there was the awayswinger, then the inswinger, and then the one that swings away again. Bhui pushes forward with hard hands and gets a thick edge to Watson at first slip. Terrific start for CSK"
0.4,"Chahar to Bhui, no run","now he gets it to cut in from a back of a length, and Bhui defends from the crease. Four dots. Pressure on already."
0.3,"Chahar to Bhui, no run","some shape away outside off, left alone"
0.2,"Chahar to Bhui, no run","in the air, and almost a duck for the debutant. Bhui can't get entirely on top of this short ball and skews it in the air as point runs forward and slides but the ball drops short"
0.1,"Chahar to Bhui, no run","short of a length on off, extra bounce, Bhui keeps it out from the crease"
19.6,"Stanlake to Dhoni, 2 runs","really full on off stump, not quite a yorker, Dhoni clears his front leg and belts it ram-rod straight, so much so it hits the stumps at the other end. They get a single and finish with 182 for 3"
19.5,"Stanlake to Raina, 1 run","sliding into the pads, swatted away to deep square leg"
19.4,"Stanlake to Raina, no run","Raina shuffles across off, yorker just outside leg, Raina does not make contact. Not called a wide. Did that flick the pad?"
19.3,"Stanlake to Dhoni, 1 run","full-toss outside off, Dhoni backs away and splices it over the covers. Two fielders circle around it but both miss it"
19.2,"Stanlake to Dhoni, SIX runs","back of a length and outside off, 129kph, slower one from Stanlake. Dhoni picks the legcutter, stands still, and short-arms it over the midwicket boundary. That back is fine. If it isn't, then the hands are great"
19.1,"Stanlake to Raina, 1 run","short and angling across off, slogs and top-edges it to deep third man"
18.6,"Kaul to Dhoni, no run","Dhoni venturing a sweep? Interesting. Near yorker outside off, Dhoni shuffles across off, and wears it on the pad"
18.5,"Kaul to Dhoni, FOUR runs","full-toss outside off, Dhoni uses the pace of the bowler and deftly carves it away just wide of short third man for four"
18.4,"Kaul to Raina, 1 run","Raina shuffles away outside leg, Kaul follows him with a very full ball and attacks the pads. Deflected away to midwicket"
18.3,"Kaul to Raina, FOUR runs","116.4ks, short and wide outside off, Raina, having stepped away outside leg, tests out his calf, reaches out for the ball. Delays his shot and scythes it away to the left of backward point. Mr.IPL brings up his first fifty of the season"
18.2,"Kaul to Dhoni, 1 run","Dhoni forays down the track, meets a full-toss outside off, and hits it down to long-on"
18.1,"Kaul to Dhoni, FOUR runs","banged in short and aimed at the head of Dhoni, he top-edges a hook fine of short fine leg. Fortunate runs for CSK and Dhoni"
17.6,"Rashid Khan to Raina, FOUR runs","dragged into the hips, Raina swivels and short-arms it away past short fine leg for another four. Another bad day for the best T20 bowler. He ends with 1 for 49"
17.5,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, 1 run","another short dart outside off, nearly 100ks, pulled away to deep midwicket off the back foot"
17.4,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 1 run",picked off the pads through square leg
17.3,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, 1 run","short, skids on outside off, chopped to backward point"
17.2,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, FOUR runs","dragged short and outside off, Dhoni sizes it up and shovels it away with great power over Raina's head. First boundary for Dhoni v Rashid"
17.1,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, no run","back of a length and skids on off, jabbed back to Rashid"
16.6,"Kaul to Dhoni, 1 run","short on off, Dhoni steps out and skews it to the covers"
16.5,"Kaul to Raina, 1 run",backs away and carves to backward point
16.4,"Kaul to Rayudu, 1 run, OUT","What a horrible mix-up between the wickets. Farcical running. But Rayudu and Raina laugh it off. Rayudu raises his bat and walks off. This was short and wide outside off, flat-batted away to wide long-off, where Pandey, one of India's best fielders, fumbles. Rayudu senses an opportunity for an extra run. Raina also (seemingly) calls for the second. Pandey throws the ball to Kaul, who fumbles too. He then runs after the ball, tags it to Williamson, who takes the bails off to catch Rayudu short at the non-striker's end. Rayudu can't undo his steps in time"
16.3,"Kaul to Rayudu, FOUR runs","slower knuckle ball, dips on off, or just a shade outside off, Rayudu stretches out and reverse-paddles it fine of short third man"
16.2,"Kaul to Raina, 1 run","fullish and outside off, whipped across the line to deep midwicket"
16.1,"Kaul to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length and outside off, Rayudu shimmies out and slices to short third man"
17.6,"Boult to AB, FOUR runs","and just to prove that he and the coaching manual are still good buds, he essays a picture perfect cover drive to finish the game off."
17.5,"Boult to AB, FOUR runs","he goes around the wicket for the bouncer, all with the aim of cramping AB up. But the genius that he is, AB sways away, makes his own room and lifts it over short third man's head"
17.4,"Boult to Mandeep, 1 run","fullish on leg stump, turns it through midwicket"
17.3,"Boult to AB, 1 run","short and outside off, AB chops it to point"
17.2,"Boult to Mandeep, 1 run",drops and runs to cover
17.1,"Boult to Mandeep, 2 runs",taps a full toss down the ground and pinches a second run as well. RCB need 10 runs to win now. AB needs 19 for a century
16.6,"Morris to Mandeep, 1 run","slow, dipping full toss. Mandeep flicks through square leg and steals the strike"
16.5,"Morris to Mandeep, FOUR runs","wallops the back of a length ball outside off over mid-off. Roy is the man haring after it, hoping to drag it back, throwing himself head-first at the ball. It's travelled too far, and he might have hurt himself from the effort. He's on his haunches with a crowd around him, talking to Chris Morris and the physio. Roy has gone off the field"
16.4,"Morris to Mandeep, no run",nudges the length ball to short midwicket
16.3,"Morris to AB, 1 run",slower ball becomes a full toss on leg stump. AB taps it down to long leg
16.2,"Morris to Mandeep, 1 run",drops the leg cutter at third man
16.2,"Morris to Mandeep, 1 wide","full, slow and sliding down leg.  Mandeep tries a flick. Doesn't come off"
16.1,"Morris to Mandeep, SIX runs","top-edge sails away to the boundary behind him. Well, that's one way to do it."
15.6,"Boult to Mandeep, 1 run","shortish and outside off, taps it down to third man"
15.5,"Boult to Anderson, OUT","144. 8 kph. And it's good enough to beat Anderson, who is swinging for the fences. Done by pure pace. This is what the non-millenials say you miss, I hit."
15.4,"Boult to AB, 1 run","both batsmen are at the same end! Anderson races through the moment AB glides the short ball to point. But AB himself is not terribly keen. Then he changes his mind and goes for the run. But wait, by that point Anderson realises he should get back to the non-strikers' end and all of that culminates with both he, AB and the bowler Boult waiting on the fielder. The throw is poor, even Boult can't save its blushes. And so, Anderson has the chance to complete the single he so dearly wanted"
15.3,"Boult to Anderson, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, heaves it out to long-on"
15.2,"Boult to Anderson, no run","the perfect wide yorker, with a tinge of away swing to beat Anderson's reach"
15.1,"Boult to Anderson, SIX runs",Anderson's decided I want a slice of this pie. Takes a full toss around waist high and nails it over deep midwicket
14.6,"Morris to Anderson, 1 run",he's blocking a full toss - while his partner is belting yorkers. This is just bonkers
14.5,"Morris to AB, 1 run","top edge but with the ball going only as far as the 30 yard circle, and everyone on the leg side in the deep, AB's very very safe"
14.5,"Morris to AB, 1 wide","goes for a bouncer, from around the wicket, but it goes too high. In looking to escape AB's punishment, he runs into the umpire's wrath"
14.4,"Morris to AB, FOUR runs","slower ball, sliding down leg, AB swipes it to the left of short fine leg. He's GPSing the ball into the gaps now. Simple as that."
14.3,"Morris to AB, SIX runs",he's not targeting the boundary - HE'S TARGETING THE BLEEPIN ROOF! Length ball. The absolute last thing you bowl to AB. And he clatters it straight down the ground.
14.2,"Morris to AB, no run","tries to cramp AB with a back of a length ball on leg stump, the batsman swings it away to short fine leg"
14.1,"Morris to Anderson, 1 run","short of a length and outside off, punches to deep point"
13.6,"Tewatia to Anderson, 1 run",googly - pitches it short though and Anderson pulls to long-on
13.5,"Tewatia to AB, 1 run","sets up for a heave again, but seeing the leg break turn a slight bit more than he budgets for, hits it along the ground to deep cover"
13.4,"Tewatia to AB, SIX runs","length ball, giving him the freedom to swing through the line. AB accepts it and politely slog sweeps the ball over long-on"
13.3,"Tewatia to Anderson, 1 run","tosses it up on leg stump, Anderson flicks to deep square leg"
13.2,"Tewatia to AB, 1 run","full and outside off, down comes that blade, full of vengeance, to bludgeon the ball to deep cover."
13.1,"Tewatia to Anderson, 1 run","shortish and outside off, chops it to deep point"
12.6,"Patel to AB, SIX runs","sweeps the fast bowler over square leg! Pure audaciousness from the very best in the world. He could block a million balls with a Test on the line. He could get a fifty off 20 odd in a T20, skipping outside off and screwing up the opposition's plans. No country for near yorkers"
12.5,"Patel to AB, no run","bounces him this time, de Villiers is prepared for it, sways back to ramp the ball over short third man. He misses it. Miracles do happen"
12.4,"Patel to Anderson, 1 run","thick outside edge as he looks to go big over cover. Third man is stuck on the boundary, perhaps not picking that the ball is coming towards him. Eventually comes up to take the ball on the bounce"
12.3,"Patel to AB, 1 run","hits the yorker length, AB knocks it down to long-on"
12.2,"Patel to AB, FOUR runs","dismisses it to the boundary - he was eyeing midwicket, but he'll settle for extra cover. Mr 360 at his very best, starting things off by moving across outside off to open up the leg side. But Harshal one-ups him by bowling wide, as far wide as he dares. But AB raises the game with a blistering lofted drive for his fifty, off only 24 balls"
12.1,"Patel to AB, SIX runs","who cares if the opposition just sparked to life? I'ma see this length ball and pulverise it over long-on. Thank you very much. That's what's going on in AB's head. I'm paraphrasing, of course."
11.6,"Tewatia to AB, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to extra cover where Boult - believe it or not - allows it to come on, puts a barrier behind it and fields one with his body completely aligned."
11.5,"Tewatia to Anderson, 1 run","oh stop it, Trent Boult! You show off! Short ball on middle stump, gets back in the crease and pummels this pull shot. Boult leaps to his right at deep midwicket to stop this on the bounce"
11.4,"Tewatia to Anderson, no run",spits off the pitch as Anderson looks to defend on the back foot. Gets him on the glove and lobs safely into the leg side
11.3,"Tewatia to AB, 1 run","full on leg stump, jams it out to long-on"
11.2,"Tewatia to Anderson, 1 run","short and wide outside off, backs away and cuts to long-off"
11.1,"Tewatia to AB, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to long-off off the back foot"
10.6,"Patel to Kohli, OUT","get out of here Trent Boult! Someone check if that isn't a robot there! This is sensational. A one-handed leap to his right at deep square after being wrong-footed to his left, then a landing backwards and a cobra pose to keep his chest from touching the rope! Soft signal out. Replays say - OUT. Wow. Unbelievable. It's a full toss on the pads and it's flying, flat over Boult's head because Kohli has got good power on that flick. It's a stunning recovery from Boult. A leap backwards, holding on with the right hand, landing on his stomach and then stopping all that momentum to complete it. Gets back on his feet and even he's in shock."
10.5,"Patel to Kohli, 2 runs","he's in some trouble, but they've turned it into two runs. It's a slower bouncer and he picks it very late. Bunts it in front of long-on with soft hands and AB comes back for the second"
10.4,"Patel to AB, 1 run","short ball wide outside off, scythes it to sweeper cover"
10.3,"Patel to AB, 2 runs","length ball on leg stump, clipped off his pads to deep square's left"
10.2,"Patel to AB, FOUR runs",full toss on the pads. Go pick it up from the boundary.  AB doesn't have to move. Deep midwicket is powerless to his right
10.1,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","length ball outside off, punched on the up to mid-off"
9.6,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run",slow and short. Kohli nearly misses this one as he tries to go too square with the pull. But he manages to stay on his feet and get bat for a single at deep square
9.5,"Tewatia to AB, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, shovelled to deep midwicket off the back foot"
9.4,"Tewatia to AB, no run","length ball on off, driven to extra cover"
9.3,"Tewatia to AB, SIX runs","drops it short and doesn't bother to look! Tewatia has been slapped to the edge of the Chinnaswamy's roof, and for effect, AB makes sure it bounces back into the ground from there so that the game can move on. Proper pull shot over deep midwicket"
9.2,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run","length ball on leg stump, nudged to deep square off the back foot"
9.1,"Tewatia to AB, 1 run","short of a length, pushed through flat and skidding into him as he gets on the back foot. Punches it to long-on"
8.6,"Patel to AB, 1 run","full toss on leg stump, flicked straight to deep midwicket"
8.5,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run",slower ball dug in short outside off. Hangs back in the crease and slaps it towards long-on
8.4,"Patel to AB, 1 leg bye",yorker on leg stump. Nicely bowled. De Villiers can't get this flick away. Cops it on the pad and it deflects into the off side
8.3,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","offcutter, short of a length and wide outside off. Slices straight to short third man"
8.2,"Patel to AB, 1 run","short of a length and wide outside off, a nicely timed square drive finds sweeper cover"
8.1,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run",length ball just outside off. Shuffles and taps to deep midwicket
7.6,"Morris to Kohli, 1 run","yorker on leg stump, jammed out to deep midwicket"
7.5,"Morris to AB, 1 run",leading edge goes over Morris. It's a back-of-the-hand slower ball that loops in at middle stump. De Villiers gets it on the full but he hasn't picked it. His flick ends up at mid-off
7.4,"Morris to Kohli, 1 run","short ball angled in at the corridor. Mistimed pull, this time. But it's not aerial. Single at deep midwicket"
7.3,"Morris to AB, 1 run","short ball outside off, mistimed hook into the turf. Gets it out to deep midwicket"
7.2,"Morris to Kohli, 1 run",length ball angled into the stumps. Walks down the pitch and nudges to long-on on the up
7.1,"Morris to Kohli, FOUR runs","can't stop the bleeding! Overpitched ball on the pads and Kohli merely leans into this, gets his body weight into the bat and closes the wrists at the last moment to caress this between deep square and deep midwicket"
6.6,"Nadeem to AB, FOUR runs","and now the sweep again! Nadeem tosses this right up, full and wide outside off. No sweeping from there, right? Wrong. AB shuffles and swats it even harder this time to beat deep midwicket"
6.5,"Nadeem to AB, FOUR runs",stunning! A back foot punch after forcing the bowler to bowl short with the sweep last ball. It's on middle stump and he's promptly back in the crease - right back - to get this between deep midwicket and long-on
6.4,"Nadeem to AB, FOUR runs","length ball outside off, gets a big stride in and sweeps against the turn to bisect deep square and deep midwicket"
6.3,"Nadeem to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length outside off, driven uppishly to sweeper cover off the back foot"
6.2,"Nadeem to Kohli, no run","hits Pant's right knee and is nearly run out. Kohli looking to run this late cut fine, is already running down the pitch. But Pant has stuck a leg out and nearly gets this to deflect onto the stumps"
6.1,"Nadeem to AB, 1 run","length ball angled in at leg stump, gets on the back foot and taps it to deep midwicket"
5.6,"Morris to Kohli, no run",short and wide outside off. Steps out and swats at it but can't make connection
5.5,"Morris to Kohli, no run","length ball on middle stump, flicked on the up to midwicket's left but can't beat his dive"
5.4,"Morris to Kohli, SIX runs",just clears Vijay Shankar at deep square leg! Oh that's really close. Length ball lifting up at him as he walks into it. Whips his wrists at this to pick it up. Shankar sprints to his left and puts in a big leap to his left - and he's a tall man - but he can't get a hand on this
5.3,"Morris to Kohli, no run",bouncer dug in very shot. Gets big on Kohli and he ducks under it
5.2,"Morris to Kohli, no run",beats the outside edge. Back of a length ball outside off and he jabs at it on the angle. But it holds itself in the pitch and jags away
5.1,"Morris to Kohli, no run","length ball outside off, driven firmly on the up to mid-off"
4.6,"Nadeem to AB, FOUR runs",oh what a shot! Length ball curving in at leg stump and he opens up his body and wrists so nicely to make room and go over extra cover with the turn
4.5,"Nadeem to AB, FOUR runs",shot. Length ball on middle and he gets down nice and early to swat this behind square with a nicely connected sweep
4.4,"Nadeem to AB, no run","length outside off, cut straight to cover"
4.3,"Nadeem to Kohli, OUT","horrendous running and De Kock has ended up sacrificing his wicket. There is no run there. De Kock thinks so, but his no either isn't accepted or isn't heard, as Kohli keeps taking strides down the pitch as he watches the ball roll towards backward point. In the end, Kohli is halfway down, De Kock is stranded and he crosses over to give his wicket away"
4.2,"Nadeem to Kohli, FOUR runs","outside edge past slip! Oh Nadeem will think about this all night if Kohli makes runs today! He's beaten him in flight, got the ball to turn away from length outside off and induced an edge.  Slip is very very wide and that's four"
4.1,"Nadeem to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length and in at middle stump, gets on the back foot and punches to deep midwicket"
3.6,"Maxwell to de Kock, 1 run","length on off stump, steps out and jams it out to mid-on"
3.5,"Maxwell to de Kock, no run","short of a length outside off, cut to point"
3.4,"Maxwell to de Kock, SIX runs",nailed it. Length ball fired into the pads and De Kock is down on it quickly for a clean swing from under. Sends it over the long leg boundary with this sweep
3.3,"Maxwell to Kohli, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket off the front foot"
3.2,"Maxwell to de Kock, 1 run",short of a length and slow outside off. Steps out and drops it in front of point with soft hands
3.1,"Maxwell to de Kock, no run","length ball floated in at off stump, defended towards point off the outside half"
2.6,"Boult to de Kock, 1 run",length ball in at leg stump. Leans in and taps to mid-on on the up
2.5,"Boult to Kohli, 1 run","length on leg stump, tapped to deep square's left off the back foot"
2.4,"Boult to de Kock, 1 run",full and in at leg stump. Walks down and clips it to deep square
2.3,"Boult to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, walks into it and runs it down to third man"
2.2,"Boult to de Kock, 1 run","length ball swinging away wide outside off, taps on the up to sweeper cover"
2.1,"Boult to Kohli, 1 run","good length outside off with some late swing inwards. No feet as Kohli looks to drive through the cover, well away from the body. Gets an inside edge onto pad"
1.6,"Maxwell to Vohra, OUT",nervous Roy at deep backward square. Looks like he's held on! Vohra stops halfway through a sweep against a leg side ball. It's a top edge that hangs up teasingly for Roy who might have lost it early on in the air because he looked very nervous as he ran in. But he manages to get down quickly and he has his fingers around the ball
1.5,"Maxwell to Vohra, no run","short of a length at leg stump, glanced uppishly to short fine"
1.5,"Maxwell to Vohra, 1 wide",length ball spins down leg side and past his attempted flick
1.4,"Maxwell to Vohra, no run","back of a length just outside off, defended towards midwicket off the back foot"
1.3,"Maxwell to Vohra, 2 runs","length ball on middle stump, shuffles and nudges it uppishly towards deep backward square"
1.2,"Maxwell to de Kock, 1 run","length on off stump, pushed in front of cover point with soft hands"
1.1,"Maxwell to de Kock, no run",short and wide outside off. Comes on slowly and he can't get power on the cut. It's a tap to point in the end
0.6,"Boult to Vohra, no run","huuuuuuge appeal for lbw but the umpire isn't swayed by it. Beautiful bowling from Boult, pitching up to the new batsman, getting the ball to curl into him late. Vohra is not at all ready for the fiendish delivery. He tries to play a shot into the leg side and possibly gets an inside edge? Cause otherwise that kinda looks plumb"
0.5,"Boult to de Kock, 1 run","full on leg stump, de Kock takes care not to hit across the line and finds a single at mid-on"
0.4,"Boult to de Kock, no run",
0.3,"Boult to de Kock, FOUR runs","pristine hit! The on the up drive works perfectly, showing how well this new ball is coming onto the bat. All de Kock does is open the face to beat cover on his right"
0.2,"Boult to de Kock, no run","back of a length on off stump, punches it into the covers"
0.1,"Boult to de Kock, no run","full on middle, with a hint of away swing. De Kock does well to present a straight bat"
19.6,"Anderson to Tewatia, no run","full and outside off, looks for a slash, only gets a bottom edge to the wicketkeeper"
19.5,"Anderson to Tewatia, FOUR runs","pretends to make room outside leg. The bowler lands it around the yorker outside off. Tewatia jumps in line with it, gets low, and scoops it over fine leg. Also, while running down the pitch, trying to take a single. he collides with Anderson"
19.4,"Anderson to Pant, OUT","taken at long-on. Pant has produced some sensational shots. He looks for another, against a slower ball outside off, but this time it comes right off the bottom of the bat. Goes high instead of long and AB de Villiers takes a striaghtforward catch"
19.3,"Anderson to Pant, no run",spots the left-hander switching his stance for a reverse scoop and so plants the ball over the wide line to keep it out of Pant's reach
19.2,"Anderson to Pant, SIX runs",runs down the pitch and decimates a length ball over long-on. That's travelled!
19.1,"Anderson to Tewatia, 1 leg bye","slow, full, on leg stump. Tewatia looks for the sweep, makes no contact, has to settle for a leg bye"
18.6,"Woakes to Pant, FOUR runs","now the other side, walking across his stumps to make sure he can scoop a slower short ball outside off over short fine leg's head. Pant is giving the Daredevils a total well beyond their wildest dreams when they were 28 for 2 after the Powerplay"
18.5,"Woakes to Pant, FOUR runs","what the weirdness  Woakes is looking for the wide yorker. Misses his mark by about two inches. And Pant is waiting, crouched in his stance, the bat face open, and at the perfect time, unleashes a scoop over third man"
18.4,"Woakes to Pant, 4 leg byes","walks across and swipes at a short ball, looking for the long leg boundary. Ends up with a miscue over the wicketkeeper. Comes off the thigh pad. Fifty partnership in 20 balls. Pant has made 41 of those"
18.3,"Woakes to Pant, no run","the perfect wide yorker. Inside the line, but too far from the reach of the batsman"
18.2,"Woakes to Pant, no run","looks to carve the short ball over point, but there isn't quite enough room for him to do so."
18.1,"Woakes to Pant, SIX runs","full and outside off stump, Pant monsters it over cover. It's bat speed again. He sees the chance to free the arms and he holds absolutely nothing back. RCB leaking runs in the death again"
17.6,"Siraj to Pant, 1 run","half-volley on leg stump, Pant flicks it handsomely to deep midwicket"
17.5,"Siraj to Pant, SIX runs","pumps it down the ground! This is a back of a length ball. And he unleashes a front foot lofted drive. That's tough to pull off. His bottom-hand strength and bat swing must be insane; has to be to get under the ball, and make contact with the middle of the bat and not the high part of it."
17.4,"Siraj to Pant, no run","goes short on middle, Pant lets it go and then goes around yelling at himself."
17.4,"Siraj to Pant, 1 wide","slower ball and a premeditating Pant, looking to slog sweep the ball, is beaten soundly. Only problem is the umpire decides he's strayed too far outside off"
17.3,"Siraj to Pant, no run","full and outside off, he bangs it back down the ground and Siraj is in the way"
17.2,"Siraj to Pant, SIX runs","low full toss in line with the stumps, but Pant somehow flicks it over the square leg boundary, despite there being a man positioned to take a catch"
17.1,"Siraj to Tewatia, 1 leg bye",looks for the yorker on leg stump and refuses Pant the room to get under the ball. Ends up having to settle for a leg bye
16.6,"Woakes to Pant, FOUR runs","fifty! And it comes off a very good shot - largely because he picks the slower ball, then the most vulnerable part of the field and exploits both. Pull shot past short fine leg. Oh wait, maybe I am overselling it. The shot comes off an inside edge. Sorry!"
16.5,"Woakes to Tewatia, 1 run",falls short of cover - which is where Siraj is at now. The ball has it in for him. Tewatia goes gung ho again at a full delivery
16.4,"Woakes to Tewatia, FOUR runs","runs back, leaps up, sticks a hand out, but the ball evades mid-off! Tough break for Siraj, and even worse, it runs away to the boundary. Mis-hit loft from Tewatia"
16.3,"Woakes to Tewatia, no run","shortish, cramping him on leg stump. Pant, even as he tries to make room, ends up pushing to cover"
16.2,"Woakes to Tewatia, no run",beats him with a length ball outside off. Looks like he gets just enough away movement off it.
16.1,"Woakes to Tewatia, FOUR runs","he's aiming for third man, gets a thick outside edge to a good length ball outside off, and it works in his favour as the ball scurries away to the boundary"
15.6,"Chahal to Pant, no run","lbw appeal is turned down. Looking to ramp it fine this time as Chahal fires in what looks like a seam-up ball on leg stump. It's full and fast and catches him on the leg, but the umpire says no. Probably pitching outside"
15.5,"Chahal to Pant, SIX runs",reverse-swat clears the third man boundary! It's a short of a length ball and Pant swivels quickly before having to really drag this using his forearms. Manages it somehow and clears the line
15.4,"Chahal to Pant, SIX runs",beats him in flight and is probably excited for a while before he remembers which ground this is. Pant with a big heave at this loopy length ball googly outside off. Miscues it completely but that's sailed over long-off
15.3,"Chahal to Maxwell, OUT","Siraj runs to his right and lunges to hold on at short third man. Maxwell is done by Chahal's slowness. It's tossed right up at a length outside off, and he looks to go over square on the off side with a reverse sweep. Ends up slicing it because he's through the shot too early. An indifferent season continues to go badly for Maxwell. Royal Challengers, like most teams, will be happy to see him gone in the 16th over"
15.2,"Chahal to Pant, 1 run","good length outside off, deep in the crease as he taps this to long-off"
15.1,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run",back of a length and pushed through. Leg stump line and he gets on the back foot to punch to deep midwicket
14.6,"Siraj to Pant, no run","Pant is struck above his back knee as this tails away from him when he tries to slog it. He's on the floor. In the mean time, RCB are reviewing for lbw. It was given not out. Possibly pitching outside leg. No doubt with line otherwise I'd say yes, pitching well outside leg. Woeful review. Pant's back on his feet. On we go."
14.5,"Siraj to Pant, no run","full toss on off stump, shovels it straight to midwicket. Missed out "
14.5,"Siraj to Pant, 1 wide",attempted slower ball is pushed very wide. It's also quite short
14.4,"Siraj to Maxwell, 1 run",length ball just outside off. A short-arm pull as this skids on. Febbly rolls out to long-on
14.3,"Siraj to Maxwell, no run","length ball just outside off, defended into the covers off the back foot"
14.2,"Siraj to Maxwell, 2 runs","just misses the stumps as Maxwell goes on the back foot again. It's an inside edge that trickles past the stumps. De Kock then runs in and takes aim at the non-striker's stumps. Hits the stumps too but Maxwell is safe, as the replays confirm. He's also come back for a second"
14.1,"Siraj to Pant, 1 run","length ball on leg stump, stays tall in the crease and chips this to deep square's right"
13.6,"Sundar to Maxwell, no run","length ball on off stump, gets on the back foot and tickles it to short fine off the inside edge. That came on quicker than he anticipated"
13.5,"Sundar to Iyer, OUT",thick outside edge to short third man. It's almost like he's a fast bowler. Fires it full and wide outside off - almost past the wide marker. Iyer reaches out again but this one is drifting away and he won't be able to get it into the leg side. It lobs straight to the fielder there
13.4,"Sundar to Pant, 1 run","length ball floated up at middle, sweeps along the floor to long leg"
13.3,"Sundar to Iyer, 1 run","full toss on middle stump, flicks to deep midwicket"
13.2,"Sundar to Iyer, SIX runs","fifty for Iyer, and this one is fetched from wide outside off. Length and across him. He reaches a long way and drags it wide of deep midwicket as he clears the boundary to his left"
13.1,"Sundar to Iyer, SIX runs",see ya! Sundar skids a short of a length ball at the pads from around the wickets and Iyer drops all the technique training he's done through his life and swings wildly to send it a long way over deep midwicket
12.6,"Siraj to Pant, SIX runs","launches it down the ground! He spots a half-volley, and this time takes great pains to get under the ball and secure the elevation needed to clear the boundary"
12.5,"Siraj to Iyer, 1 run","shortish on off stump, knocks it down to point"
12.4,"Siraj to Iyer, FOUR runs",clears the front leg and laces the length ball on middle stump over extra cover. Amazing shot
12.3,"Siraj to Iyer, no run","back of a length and outside off, he looks to power it away square on the off side. No contact"
12.2,"Siraj to Iyer, no run",is he trying to leave or ramp or pull? Ends up doing half of each shot and sends the short ball to midwicket
12.1,"Siraj to Pant, 1 run",carves the back of a length delivery down to deep third man
11.6,"Sundar to Pant, 1 leg bye","pushes it through on leg stump, Pant looks to pull it away but makes contact with only thigh pad"
11.5,"Sundar to Iyer, 1 run",another simple flick to long-on. Looks like Daredevils have instructions not to over-extend themselves
11.4,"Sundar to Pant, 1 run","full on leg stump, he shimmies down the pitch and clips through midwicket"
11.3,"Sundar to Iyer, 1 run",works a shortish delivery from outside off to the right of long-on
11.2,"Sundar to Pant, 1 run",gets forward to block behind third man
11.1,"Sundar to Iyer, 1 run",knocks a back of a length delivery on off stump to long-on
10.6,"Woakes to Pant, FOUR runs",mid-off is up and Pant drills the wide half-volley down the ground like a pro
10.5,"Woakes to Pant, 2 runs","full and wide, he nails it through the covers. Chahal does well sweeping that boundary"
10.4,"Woakes to Iyer, 1 run",chops the back of a length ball down to deep third man
10.3,"Woakes to Pant, 1 run",now he has room and he slashes the short ball away to deep point
10.2,"Woakes to Pant, no run","tries to make room, but Woakes doesn't allow such shenanigans. Pant only ends up cutting the ball to point"
10.1,"Woakes to Pant, no run",slashes as hard as he can through the line of a good length ball outside off. No connection
9.6,"Sundar to Pant, 1 run","gets down the track, to the pitch of a good length ball on leg stump, and works it to long-on"
9.5,"Sundar to Iyer, 1 run",another block into the off side for a single
9.4,"Sundar to Pant, 1 run",blocks to cover point and jogs across to the other end
9.3,"Sundar to Iyer, 1 run",gets across on off stump and sends a good length ball away to deep square leg
9.2,"Sundar to Pant, 1 run","lets the ball come to him, meeting it under his eyes for a flick to the left of midwicket"
9.1,"Sundar to Pant, no run",tosses it up from around the wicket on middle stump. Pant tucks it to midwicket
8.6,"Yadav to Iyer, SIX runs","jeez, that's outrageous! it's a half-volley on leg stump and Iyer treats it fairly kindly. All he does is flick the ball. Some other-worldly force takes it over the boundary at midwicket. And we have a time out to figure out just what happened there "
8.5,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run","top work from Mandeep at point, diving to his left to stop a cut shot that might rival a bazooka for power"
8.4,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","not quite enough room so Iyer plays within himself, gliding the short ball down to third man"
8.3,"Yadav to Iyer, FOUR runs",superb timing! He stands up tall against the short and wide delivery and slaps it to the left of the fielder in the deep.
8.2,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run",hammers the short and wide delivery as ferociously as he could to deep point
8.1,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run",effortlessly flicks a length ball on off stump to deep midwicket. Touch of class in that.
7.6,"Sundar to Pant, no run","full on middle and off, Pant shuffles across his stumps and turns it to midwicket"
7.5,"Sundar to Iyer, 1 run","full and outside off, blocks through cover point"
7.4,"Sundar to Pant, 1 run","he's very wary of slow deliveries in line with the stumps. Waits until it gets to him, uses soft hands, angles the face and taps the ball gently to point"
7.3,"Sundar to Pant, FOUR runs",gets down low and muscles the full ball on middle stump to the point boundary - with a reverse sweep. Very tough shot to pull off but he does it so very well
7.2,"Sundar to Pant, no run",goes around the wicket to the left-hander and even Sundar - who rarely gets the ball to move sideways - is beating the edge with turn.
7.1,"Sundar to Iyer, 1 run","good length on off stump, he dabs it behind point"
6.6,"Siraj to Iyer, 1 run",flicks a very full ball on leg stump to deep square leg
6.5,"Siraj to Iyer, no run","fullish on off stump, he smashes it back to the bowler"

6.2,"Siraj to Pant, 1 run",opens the face and makes sure the short ball outside off is run past point's right
6.1,"Siraj to Pant, no run","shortish and outside off, he glides it to point"
5.6,"Chahal to Pant, 1 run",turns a good length ball - which turns sharply again - to short fine leg
5.5,"Chahal to Pant, FOUR runs",makes room and cuts the short ball away to the cover boundary. Super shot. Plenty of bottom hand power
5.4,"Chahal to Roy, OUT","knocks over leg stump! Sensational bowling from Chahal. After sowing doubts with big turning legbreaks, he sends down the flipper. Very quick, a shade short, on leg stump, tempting the batsman to back away and cut and beating him for pace. So Chahal is not just turning the ball off the pitch, but skid on too."
5.3,"Chahal to Roy, no run",third time beaten! And this is huge turn! Chahal pitches it on middle. Roy is uncertain as he pushes forward. He could have had a bat as broad as five feet and he would still have missed it
5.2,"Chahal to Iyer, 1 run",neatly nudges a good length ball off middle stump to deep midwicket
5.1,"Chahal to Iyer, no run","it's a short ball, giving him the room to free his arms, but Iyer finds short midwicket with a mistimed pull"
4.6,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run",drives on the up and gets an outside edge away to third man
4.5,"Yadav to Iyer, FOUR runs","back of a length and outside off, slaps it through point. No boundaries for four overs and suddenly two in the space of three balls"
4.4,"Yadav to Iyer, no run",stands up tall again and nudges the short ball to midwicket
4.3,"Yadav to Iyer, FOUR runs",gets up with the short ball on middle and deftly turns it around the corner to fine leg. Simple
4.2,"Yadav to Roy, 1 run","opens the face to try and find some runs behind point. There are none and so Roy is sent back. Mandeep hits the stumps direct and they pinch a single off the overthrow. Then the man backing up hits the stumps direct at the non-strikers now. Two perfect throws, no wickets"
4.1,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
3.6,"Chahal to Roy, no run","panics and goes for a reverse sweep, even those last-ditch measures don't work. Chahal reads the batsman perfectly, bowls on middle and leg, not allowing Roy the room he needs to work the ball"
3.5,"Chahal to Roy, no run","rips it past the outside edge again! Beautiful bowling from the leggie. He loops it up on middle, draws Roy forward, gets pretty decent purchase off the pitch and leaves Roy looking utterly bewildered"
3.4,"Chahal to Iyer, 1 run",hangs back and whips a shortish delivery through midwicket
3.3,"Chahal to Roy, 1 leg bye","shimmies down the track, but Chahal spots it early, pulls his length back, and doesn't give any room. Roy tries a flick and is hit on the pads. All he can get is a leg bye"
3.2,"Chahal to Roy, no run",shifts himself leg side of a tossed up ball on middle and drives into the covers
3.2,"Chahal to Roy, 1 wide","slows it down this time, letting the ball drift into the pads. This time the ball slides through without turning to the wicketkeeper"
3.1,"Chahal to Roy, no run","massive turn and is it enough to stump him?. He pushes it through on leg stump, demanding Roy to hit against the turn. The batsman tries, he's beaten all ends up, but the good thing is, his back leg did not lift up off the crease."
2.6,"Yadav to Roy, 1 run",changes tactics and uses soft hands to bunt the back of a length ball towards point for a single
2.5,"Yadav to Roy, no run","slower ball, in line with the stumps, Roy tries to force it through midwicket. No luck"
2.4,"Yadav to Roy, no run","nails the backfoot cover drive, but finds the fielder again."
2.3,"Yadav to Roy, no run","full on middle and leg, he flicks to midwicket"
2.2,"Yadav to Gambhir, OUT","top-edges the pull and Umesh strikes early again! It's a short ball, Gambhir tries to drag it from outside off. It gets a bit big on him. The bat face turns in his hand. The ball has no timing on it as it goes up and Chahal jogs back at square leg to take an easy catch"
2.1,"Yadav to Gambhir, no run","full and outside off, spears it to mid-off"
1.6,"Woakes to Gambhir, 1 run","spears in a yorker, at the base of middle stump. Gambhir does well to yank his feet out of the way and bring a vertical bat down to find a single through square leg"
1.5,"Woakes to Roy, 1 run",swats a back of a length delivery outside off down to long-on
1.4,"Woakes to Gambhir, 1 leg bye","slower bouncer - and it's very well executed too. Gambhir spots the length early but not the change in pace. He's into the pull shot and though he tries to adjust his bat swing, he misses the ball and it goes off his body towards point"
1.3,"Woakes to Gambhir, 2 runs","lovely work from the captain, waiting that little bit extra to turn a ball that is on his pads far enough behind square leg for a couple of runs"
1.2,"Woakes to Gambhir, no run","good length ball outside off, Gambhir goes for an on-the-up drive over mid-off. No connection"
1.1,"Woakes to Roy, 1 run","flattens the stumps with a blistering straight drive. He sees the ball in his half, lunges forward gleefully and presents the full face of the bat. Woakes would be thrilled those wooden things were stuck where they were"
0.6,"Yadav to Gambhir, no run",gets off his toes to nudge the shortish delivery off middle stump to midwicket
0.5,"Yadav to Gambhir, no run","rippah! Umesh hits the deck and makes the new ball jag away past the outside edge. Gambhir is stuck in his crease, he's pushing at the ball nervously, he's easily beaten"
0.4,"Yadav to Gambhir, no run","nice and tight on middle, Gambhir works it off his knees to midwicket"
0.3,"Yadav to Gambhir, no run","good length, outside off, Gambhir looks to slash it through the off side, can't make contact"
0.2,"Yadav to Roy, 1 run","inside edge as Roy attempts to punch through the covers. His front foot moving so little hampers those plans and the ball ends up wandering away to square leg. On another day, he might even have been bowled"
0.1,"Yadav to Roy, no run","back of a length and outside off, Roy lets it go. There is some outswing which gives merit to the one slip in place"
11.1,"Tom Curran to Gayle, SIX runs","It's all over! Full on off, and that's been mistimed over the bowler's head. Backed away to smack this straight, but came off the blade's toe end. Doesn't matter though, as it has enough to clear the long-on boundary. Kings XI Punjab win by nine wickets"
10.6,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, 1 run",low full toss on leg stump. Gayle taps it down the ground to long on. He'll keep strike. Kings XI need five off 12 balls
10.5,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, no run","quick! Good length on off and angling across Gayle. He tries to slap this over cover, but misses completely. Wild, wild shot"
10.4,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, no run","slower ball on middle stump. Stays on the back foot, and defends it back to Mavi"
10.3,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, no run","almost chops on! Good length on off, and Gayle tries to punch it past cover. Takes an inside edge and almost onto his stumps"
10.3,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, 1 wide","yorker outside leg stump, and Gayle does well to shuffle across to the off side. Extras"
10.2,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, no run","toe crusher on leg stump, but Gayle does well to get his feet out of the ball's way, and defends with soft hands"
10.1,"Shivam Mavi to Agarwal, 1 run","full outside off, and driven with the bat's open face to the man in the deep"
9.6,"Narine to Gayle, no run","good length on middle stump, and spinning across Gayle. Defended off the back foot to the bowler. Kings XI need 9 off 18 balls"
9.5,"Narine to Agarwal, 1 run","good length on middle stump, taps it to square leg for a walking single"
9.4,"Narine to Rahul, OUT","holes out to deep midwicket! Short on middle, and Rahul top-edges the pull! Curran gets under it, and dives forward to take the catch"
9.3,"Narine to Rahul, FOUR runs","good length, and wide outside of again. Rahul goes deep into the crease and crunches this boundary behind point"
9.2,"Narine to Rahul, FOUR runs","good length, but wide outside off. Rahul comes dancing down the wicket and slaps it past extra cover on this occasion. Delightful"
9.1,"Narine to Rahul, SIX runs","fifty for Rahul too! Back of a length on off stump, and Rahul opens his stance to swing towards the leg side. Flat pull over deep midwicket"
8.6,"Chawla to Gayle, no run","full and wide outside leg stump. Gayle tries to slog-sweep, but misses. Hits his front leg, but impact's outside leg"
8.5,"Chawla to Gayle, no run","good length on leg stump. He stays on the back foot, and fends it back to Chawla"
8.4,"Chawla to Gayle, no run",quicker ball! Good length on middle and zipping right through to the keeper
8.3,"Chawla to Gayle, SIX runs","low full toss on off, and he wastes no time to get to his fifty! Smacks this over Rahul's head, and the ball lands in the crowd"
8.2,"Chawla to Gayle, SIX runs","full on off stump, and Gayle's slog sweeps this over Rahul's head. Looked like he sliced it, and that's flying over long on. Pure muscle"
8.1,"Chawla to Rahul, 1 run","full just outside off. Turns into Rahul, and he opens his bat's face to drive towards point"
7.6,"Narine to Rahul, 1 run",full on off and coming into Rahul's pads. Whipped off his toes to cow corner for a single
7.5,"Narine to Rahul, no run","full outside off, and driven well to cover. A shame that shot earned no run"
7.4,"Narine to Gayle, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and spinning into Gayle's body. Punched to long on for a walking single"
7.3,"Narine to Rahul, 1 run","good length on off, and spinning into the batsman. Turned off his pads to square leg"
7.2,"Narine to Rahul, no run","good length, just outside off. Rahul tries to cut but misses completely. Extra bounce takes it to the keeper"
7.1,"Narine to Rahul, no run","good length outside off, and that's cut off the back foot to point"

6.5,"Kuldeep to Rahul, 1 run","full on middle, and he walks across to the off side to sweep. Played to fine leg"
6.4,"Kuldeep to Gayle, 1 run",almost a yorker on the fourth-stump line. Gayle muscles this down the ground to long on
6.3,"Kuldeep to Gayle, SIX runs","overpitched wide outside off, and that's just too easy for CHG. Gets down on one knee, and swats this over long-on"
6.2,"Kuldeep to Rahul, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and spinning away from Rahul. Turned off his pads to square leg"
6.1,"Kuldeep to Rahul, FOUR runs","starts off with a half-tracker on middle, and Rahul sends that into the deep midwicket boundary. Pulled off the back foot with disdain"
5.6,"Chawla to Rahul, 1 run",advances down the ground and punches to long-on
5.5,"Chawla to Rahul, FOUR runs",that's four more. A leg-side back of a length ball and Rahul just turns around and places it through fine leg
5.4,"Chawla to Rahul, FOUR runs","short of a length, not much turn away from him, and Rahul directs a pull to deep fine leg as he shifts across and moves languidly"
5.3,"Chawla to Gayle, 1 run",slapped away towards cover-point where Uthappa moves to his left to make a diving stop
5.2,"Chawla to Gayle, no run",blindly swipes across the angle as Chawla slides this googly across him and gets him beaten
5.1,"Chawla to Rahul, 1 run",advances down the ground and flicks this flatter delivery through midwicket
4.6,"Narine to Gayle, FOUR runs",ruins a good over with a leg-side fuller delivery that Gayle gets down and sweeps through backward square leg
4.5,"Narine to Gayle, no run","good length outside off, jams the bat down and blocks into the off side"
4.4,"Narine to Gayle, no run","back of a length, spinning away, punched to point off the backfoot"
4.3,"Narine to Gayle, no run",shifts back to a length ball and punches to cover
4.2,"Narine to Gayle, no run","length, spins away, punched to cover"
4.1,"Narine to Rahul, 1 run","length ball, waits on the backfoot to long-on"
3.6,"Rana to Gayle, no run","ah, how rushed was Gayle there? Rana just fires this in at pace on Gayle's off-stump and the batsman backs away and just about manages to bring the bat down. A fraction of a second late, and he would have been gone. Imagine if the wicket had fallen that delivery! What a strange combination of circumstances that would have been to help KKR"
3.5,"Russell to Gayle, SIX runs","this one's shorter still and Gayle backs away even further.. Doesn't manage to get on top of it entirely, but manages to cart it over deep backward point"
3.4,"Russell to Gayle, FOUR runs",teases Russell by foxing him into thinking he may come down the track but in reality just backs away to a slower delivery and slaps it away through point
3.3,"Russell to Rahul, 1 run","full around off, clipped to mid-on"
3.2,"Russell to Gayle, 1 run",flicked off the hips to deep midwicket
3.1,"Russell to Gayle, SIX runs","full on middle and off, right within his swinging arc, and Gayle deposits it over cow corner with a clean swing of the arms. Off the inside part of the bat but he has so much power in those arms"
2.6,"Shivam Mavi to Rahul, SIX runs","short, outside off, Rahul gets on top of the bounce and hammers a pull over deep backward square leg"
2.5,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, 1 run","short ball, forces him to arch back with pace and no room,Gayle does well to control his shot through midwicket"
2.4,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, FOUR runs","a healthy inside edge. This one again tails away after pitching around middle and off, and Gayle drills it away through midwicket"
2.3,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, no run","length ball, angled across, stays rooted to the crease as he swings and misses"
2.2,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, FOUR runs",smokes it over the in-field after getting the front leg out of the way. Lifted from front of off over extra cover
2.1,"Shivam Mavi to Rahul, 1 run","back of a length, cuts into him,tucked behind square"
2.1,"Shivam Mavi to Rahul, 1 wide","back of a length, drifts down the leg side"
1.6,"Russell to Gayle, no run","short, pitches down the leg side, and Gayle gets over it"
1.5,"Russell to Gayle, no run","full, angled across, Gayle jams the bat down and gets beaten"
1.4,"Russell to Gayle, FOUR runs","ah, shot! Not often do you see Gayle collect boundaries with just timing and placement but this is one of those rare moments. Not a whole lot of movement of the feet but he has gorgeously placed thus fuller one through cover and point"
1.3,"Russell to Rahul, 1 run","length ball, tucked through square leg"
1.2,"Russell to Rahul, FOUR runs","short of a length on off, gets a little big on him as he shifts back in his crease and then opens the face of the bat a tad to place it through third man"
1.1,"Russell to Rahul, FOUR runs","sharp swing away from the right-hander, but look at that for a shot. Rahul gets a long stride across to cover for all the movement and then leans into a drive as he caresses it through covers"
0.6,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, no run",that's the best of the lot. On a length and subtle movement off the deck as he nearly shaves Gayle's outside edge
0.5,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, no run","short of a length, drifts away a long way and has him beaten"
0.4,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, no run","top stuff! Pitches it right up to Gayle and then gets it to swing away. Luckily for Gayle, he had his bat well inside the line"
0.3,"Shivam Mavi to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, cutting in, off the inside of the bat to square leg"
0.2,"Shivam Mavi to Rahul, FOUR runs","beautiful shot! Width on offer, and Rahul meets the pitch with half a stride forward and then uses his arms to punch it through cover and point"
0.1,"Shivam Mavi to Rahul, FOUR runs","ah, streaky! Curves in a long way from a length and finds the inside edge of Rahul as he strides forward and screams away to the fine leg boundary"
19.6,"Tye to Gill, 1 run","drops the length this time. Good length on off stump, and Gill comes dancing down the wicket. Tapped towards cover, and they complete the single. Knight Riders finish on 191 for 7"
19.5,"Tye to Chawla, 1 run","yes, they can! Full on off stump, and Chawla drives it over the non-striker's head to long off. What an excellent final over from Tye. Can he finish off well?"
19.4,"Tye to Gill, 1 run","full just outside off, and Gill drills this down the ground to long on. They can't take the second, so Chawla's back on strike"
19.3,"Tye to Chawla, 1 run","poor from Mujeeb! Drops this at short third man. It was slow and short outside off, and Chawla tried to ramp it over short third man. Slices it, but a lazy effort from Mujeeb"
19.3,"Tye to Chawla, 1 wide","full and wide outside off, and takes the pace off the delivery. He's forced to reach at it, but can't get bat to ball. The umpire, however, thinks it's a wide"
19.2,"Tye to Tom Curran, OUT","Yorker outside off stump, and Curran sticks his bat out. Takes a thick outside edge, and goes straight and flat to short third man. Even the fielder is surprised, by the looks of it"
19.1,"Tye to Tom Curran, no run","slower ball to start the over. Full outside off, and Curran's slog towards the leg side doesn't come off. Through to Rahul on the bounce"
18.6,"Barinder Sran to Tom Curran, 1 run","good length on middle, but angling across Curran. Carves it off the back foot to Mujeeb at deep point"
18.5,"Barinder Sran to Karthik, OUT","rolls his fingers over this one again, and this time DK's leg-side heave has been taken in the deep. Deceived by the (lack of) pace, and Tye at deep backward square does the rest"
18.5,"Barinder Sran to Karthik, 1 wide","goes full and wide but it's way too wide, actually. DK pulls out of the shot and earns a free run"
18.4,"Barinder Sran to Gill, 1 run","full on off and slightly swinging away. Gill drives to short extra cover but DK's halfway down the wicket! Ashwin has a shy at the stumps, but misses, which therefore allows them to take the single anyway"
18.3,"Barinder Sran to Karthik, 1 run","rolls his fingers over this one, and that's been flat-batted over the bowler's head. In fact, it comes off the toe end of the bat, and that perhaps, saves him. Lands well short of Finch at long on"
18.2,"Barinder Sran to Gill, 1 run","slower ball, and full outside leg stump. Gill tries to play it fine, but can only clip it to the man inside the circle"
18.1,"Barinder Sran to Karthik, 1 run","slower ball on leg stump, and angling across the batsman. Tapped with soft hands to point for a walking single. Gets Gill back on strike"

17.5,"Rajpoot to Gill, 2 runs","rolls his fingers over the ball, so takes the pace off. Good length outside off, and comfortably punched to wide long off for a couple"
17.5,"Rajpoot to Gill, 1 wide",awry delivery! Waist-high on middle stump and goes down the leg side. More extras
17.5,"Rajpoot to Gill, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, but way too wide reckons the umpire"
17.4,"Rajpoot to Gill, no run","late inswing, and yorks the batsman on off stump. Does well to dig it back to the bowler"
17.3,"Rajpoot to Karthik, 1 run","good length, and outside off again. Carved off the back foot to Mujeeb at short third man"
17.2,"Rajpoot to Karthik, FOUR runs","sliced like butter! Good length, and slow outside off. DK once again stays late on the back foot and simply opens his bat's face to this offcutter. Played between the keeper and short third man"
17.1,"Rajpoot to Karthik, FOUR runs","deft! Good length, and just outside off. DK stays on the back foot and opens his bat's face. Glanced to short third-man, but the fielder's dive is poor. Hits his hand, but races away for a boundary thereafter"
16.6,"Barinder Sran to Gill, FOUR runs","first-ball four! Delightful shot to get off the mark. Good length outside off, and he rides the bounce to cut it past point. Just as it happens oh-so-often, the extra ball hurts the bowling team"
16.5,"Barinder Sran to Russell, OUT","drilled to long off, but taken! Big wicket for Sran. Full on off, and Russell tries to slog it down the ground. It's hit very hard, but too flat. Karun Nair - at long off - runs to his right and sticks his hands out"
16.5,"Barinder Sran to Russell, 1 wide","good length outside leg stump, and Russell does well to shuffle across to the off side. Shoulders his arms but earns an extra run"
16.4,"Barinder Sran to Russell, FOUR runs","slower ball, and wide outside leg stump. Allows Russell to actually adjust, swivel, and then smash this pull fine behind square"
16.3,"Barinder Sran to Russell, FOUR runs","low full toss on leg stump, but all Russell has to do is get bat to ball. He simply check-drives down the ground and that's good enough for the ball to beat long off to the boundary. Sheer power"
16.2,"Barinder Sran to Karthik, 1 run","good length on middle stump, DK stays on the back foot. Punches it down the ground to long on"
16.1,"Barinder Sran to Russell, 1 run","excellent yorker to start the over. Aimed at his toes, and all Russell can do is nudge it to Mayank at deep midwicket"
15.6,"Tye to Karthik, no run","slow and short again. On the fourth-stump line, and DK misses the pull shot. The ball, once again, goes over his blade and through to Rahul on the bounce"
15.5,"Tye to Russell, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, and Russell taps it with hard hands towards cow corner. He's off the mark"
15.4,"Tye to Russell, no run","slower ball, short outside off. Russell has to wait ages before the ball comes to him, and he misses the cut completely. Bounces over Russell's blade, and through to Rahul on the bounce"
15.3,"Tye to Russell, no run","short ball on off stump, but stays terribly low! Defended off the back foot"
15.2,"Tye to Lynn, OUT","bottom-edged to the keeper! The knuckle ball earns him the wicket. Full and wide outside off, and Lynn actually followed him to the off side, but the ball's too low and it takes a feather edge. An excellent innings comes to an end"
15.1,"Tye to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length on off, and DK opens his bat's face to run it down to short third man. Lynn scampers across to the danger end"
14.6,"Ashwin to Lynn, 2 runs","good length on off, but once again legspin from Ashwin. Lynn stays on the back foot and drags a shot towards cow corner. Two men in the deep, and one of them cut it off"
14.5,"Ashwin to Lynn, FOUR runs","good length, but wide outside off. Lynn goes deep and cuts this square to Sran in the deep. Good effort by him, but did his boot - while sliding - touch the rope? Yes, it did"
14.4,"Ashwin to Karthik, 1 run","full on off, and it's the legspinner. Turns away from the batsman, who nudges it to midwicket with soft hands"
14.3,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run","full on off stump, and that's been thumped down the ground to long off"
14.2,"Ashwin to Karthik, 1 run","full outside off, and that front-foot drive has been drilled to deep extra cover"
14.1,"Ashwin to Karthik, no run","full and wide outside off, stays slightly low but DK chooses to cut again. Hit well, but straight to point"
14.1,"Ashwin to Karthik, 1 wide","full and wide outside off. Tried the legspinner but it didn't come off. Too wide, reckons the ump"
13.6,"Mujeeb to Lynn, 2 runs","good length just outside off, and drilled off the back foot to deep extra cover. Enough time to jog back for the second run. They'll get some time to recover as well. It's the time out"
13.5,"Mujeeb to Lynn, no run","drilled in full and fast on leg stump. Lynn tries to slog-sweep but misses. Hits his front leg, but impact's outside the stumps. First dot ball in 21 deliveries!"
13.4,"Mujeeb to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, and DK cuts this hard to Ashwin at point. The fielder dives to his right and stops with one hand"
13.3,"Mujeeb to Lynn, 1 run","good length on off, but spins sharply inwards. Lynn opens his bat's face and runs it fine. Stopped by Rajpoot, but wait, it slips through his hands. The misfield allows them to steal the run"
13.2,"Mujeeb to Karthik, 1 run","good length just outside off, and he punches down the ground to long off"
13.1,"Mujeeb to Karthik, FOUR runs","excellently played! Good length on off, but angling into DK. He gets down on one knee, and muscles this pull behind square leg. Hit fine enough to beat deep square leg"
12.6,"Tye to Lynn, 2 runs","dropped at deep extra cover! Short outside off, and this time Lynn's luck almost ran out. Cut it over the infield, but top-edged to the man in the deep. His diving effort just isn't good enough as the ball pops out of his hand. Barinder Sran the guilty party there"
12.5,"Tye to Karthik, 1 run","sticking with the short ball, and it's wide outside off again. DK taps it to point, but the throw has no one backing up. Allows them to collect the extra run"
12.4,"Tye to Lynn, 1 run","goes short again, and Lynn goes chasing after it. Too wide, and this time his slap-shot takes the bottom edge towards short third man"
12.3,"Tye to Lynn, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, and Lynn's forced to reach at it. Cuts it anyway, and manages to get it over the infield. Beats the man at deep extra cover too!"
12.2,"Tye to Lynn, SIX runs","knuckle ball on middle, but it's on a good length. Comes into Lynn's body, and he simply gets his front foot out of the way to tonk it over long on! 103 metres"
12.1,"Tye to Karthik, 1 run","full on off stump, and tapped comfortably towards wide long on for a walking single"
11.6,"Yuvraj to Lynn, 2 runs","short and wide outside off, but Lynn can't put it away. Bottom-edges this flat-batted shot to long off. Fifty for Lynn!"
11.5,"Yuvraj to Karthik, 1 run","good length just outside off, and he backs away to carve it towards deep extra cover"
11.4,"Yuvraj to Lynn, 1 run","good length on off, and allows Lynn to free his arms again. Bunts it down the ground to the man at long off"
11.3,"Yuvraj to Lynn, FOUR runs","half-tracker outside off, and Lynn flat-bats it straight past Yuvraj! He tried to get his hands to it, but did well to not get his fingertips to it. That would've stung. Crashes into the long-off boundary"
11.2,"Yuvraj to Karthik, 1 run","tossed up, and wide outside off. Big stride in from DK and driven past extra cover to the man in the deep"
11.1,"Yuvraj to Karthik, FOUR runs","good length, but wide outside off. DK simply sticks his bat out and ramps it just past the keeper's gloves. Minimal contact, and that helps him play it fine again"
10.6,"Ashwin to Karthik, 1 run","flatter ball on off stump, but DK simply drives it past Ashwin's left to long off. He'll keep strike"
10.5,"Ashwin to Karthik, 2 runs","full on leg stump, and worked off his pads to the area near square leg once again. No one there, and Nair has a lot of ground to make up from the deep"
10.4,"Ashwin to Karthik, 2 runs","full just outside off, and that's been clipped off his pads to square leg. Vacant area there so that allows DK to take the second"
10.3,"Ashwin to Karthik, FOUR runs","full on off, and the offspinner has been turned off his pads to midwicket. Just a simple flick, and the power behind his wrists come into play this time. Caressed towards cow corner, and beats both men in the deep"
10.2,"Ashwin to Karthik, FOUR runs","tossed up outside off, and that's put away by DK! Takes a big stride forward and heaves this over midwicket. Slog swept despite the man in the deep"
10.1,"Ashwin to Karthik, no run","full just outside off, Karthik opens his bat's face and glances it towards backward point"
9.6,"Mujeeb to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, and he rocks back to punch towards deep extra cover"
9.5,"Mujeeb to Karthik, no run","flighted full outside off, and Karthik defends off the front foot towards the off side"
9.4,"Mujeeb to Rana, OUT","miscommunication! Good-length on off stump, and Rana's cramped for space. Still tries to cut, but straight to backward point. Rajpoot collects and throws at the keeper's end, but Rana's halfway down the track. Lynn took a few steps forward but quickly said no to the single, but it was all too late "
9.3,"Mujeeb to Rana, no run","overpitched on middle and leg, and Rana chooses to defend off the front foot. Proper stride from the batsman before fending it back"
9.2,"Mujeeb to Lynn, 1 run","good length, and just outside off stump. Spins away from Lynn on this occasion, and it's been fended past the non-striker"
9.1,"Mujeeb to Rana, 1 run","full, and very wide outside off. Forces Rana to reach at it, but still chooses to sweep it to deep midwicket"
8.6,"Ashwin to Lynn, no run","carrom ball! Half-tracker on off, but gets big on Lynn. Forced to defend off the back foot, but played rather uncomfortably. Was slightly in the air, but dropped well short of Ashwin"
8.5,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","full on middle and leg, and Rana clips it off his toes to square leg. Easily negated"
8.4,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run","good length on off, and punched down the ground to long on for a single. The field's spread out now"
8.3,"Ashwin to Lynn, 2 runs","good length on off, but this is the legspinner. Lynn shuffles across to the off side and flicks it to square leg"
8.2,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","full on off, and he comes down the wicket. Tapped to long off for a walking single"
8.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, OUT",", and the time-out comes with a break in concentration! Good length on middle, and Uthappa goes for the big one first up. Rocks back and tries to pull, but has no elevation behind that shot. Straight to deep midwicket. Fifth time Ashwin gets Uthappa in ten T20 matches"
7.6,"Barinder Sran to Lynn, SIX runs","slower ball from Sran, picked up way too early. It's a leg side line, and Lynn gets the front leg out of the way and mows it over backward square leg. The most expensive KXIP over this season"
7.5,"Barinder Sran to Lynn, no run","slower length ball, opens the face to backward point"
7.4,"Barinder Sran to Lynn, SIX runs","that's another huge shot. A front-foot pull from Lynn to a length ball, and it's deposited well over midwicket. A 97-meter six"
7.3,"Barinder Sran to Lynn, FOUR runs",off the low part of the bat. Those are the perils you make yourself vulnerable to when you stay away from the line so much. But he has enough power to make up for it as he slaps it hard through cover and point
7.2,"Barinder Sran to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length outside off, opens the face and runs it down to third man"
7.1,"Barinder Sran to Uthappa, SIX runs","shot! Too short from Sran, and angled across Uthappa just enough to give him the room to free his arms. Gets on top of the bounce around off, and shovels a pull over backward square leg"
6.6,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length and spinning in, flicked to square leg"
6.5,"Ashwin to Uthappa, no run",
6.4,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run","floated up outside off, Lynn whips it from outside off through backward of square leg"
6.3,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","fullish length, spins in from outside off, and Uthappa flicks to midwicket"
6.2,"Ashwin to Lynn, 1 run","flat and on a length, flicked out to deep midwicket"
6.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run",stays back to a length ball and tucks it to midwicket
5.6,"Tye to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, opens the face and runs it down to third man for one"
5.5,"Tye to Uthappa, FOUR runs","slower, short, and angled into him, Uthappa pulls it through backward of square leg with a well-controlled shot. That was the knuckle ball"
5.4,"Tye to Uthappa, no run","fullish length outside off, slashes at it and drills it to cover"
5.3,"Tye to Uthappa, no run","strides forward to a fullish length ball outside off, and Uthappa defends back with a neat stride forward"
5.2,"Tye to Uthappa, no run","short, extra bounce outside off as he slashes and misses"
5.1,"Tye to Lynn, 1 run",well-done on the free-hit. In the blockhole and angled into Lynn as he whips it down to the cow corner region
5.1,"Tye to Uthappa, (no ball) 1 run","begins with a no-ball, on a length that's tucked towards mid-on. Hang on, he's got his foot well inside the line. That's a horrid call from the umpire. Tye jokingly asks if he can review it"
4.6,"Barinder Sran to Lynn, no run","short ball, lots of width, Lynn can't capitalise because he's standing miles away from it, somewhere outside the leg-stump. Reaches out for a slap and barely knocks it to the cover and point reigon"
4.5,"Barinder Sran to Lynn, no run","slower ball, angled well across off, no feet from Lynn as he swings early and misses"
4.4,"Barinder Sran to Lynn, no run","short ball that gets up sharply and quickly, Lynn tries to pull but it's just too quick for him"
4.3,"Barinder Sran to Lynn, FOUR runs","short ball, slower that pitches outside leg, Lynn backs away and heaves it over the backward square leg region"

3.5,"Mujeeb to Uthappa, 1 wide",tries to bowl it quicker on the pads and slides it down the leg side
3.4,"Mujeeb to Uthappa, FOUR runs","goes for the same variation but this time it's on a length, and Uthappa is able to shift back and comfortably tuck through backward square leg"
3.3,"Mujeeb to Uthappa, FOUR runs","now the conventional sweep. The back-of-the-hand that spins in actually, and Uthappa sweeps through the fine leg boundary"
3.2,"Mujeeb to Uthappa, FOUR runs","length ball outside off, not much spin into hhim, and Uthappa gets down to split the short third man region with a reverse sweep"
3.1,"Mujeeb to Uthappa, no run","sliding into middle and leg, and brushes the pad as he tries to flick"
2.6,"Rajpoot to Lynn, SIX runs","in lot more control this time around. Back of a length, angled into his leg stump, and all Lynn has to do is turn around and help it with a pull over backward square leg"
2.5,"Rajpoot to Uthappa, 1 run","short ball that completely tucks him up, Uthappa tries to force a pull and gets a top-edge that drops at the vacant spaces at the midwicket region"
2.4,"Rajpoot to Uthappa, no run","short ball, gets over a ducking Uthappa"
2.3,"Rajpoot to Uthappa, no run","ah, lovely! Got everything there apart from the edge. Invites him forward with a fullish one and gets it to curve away significantly to beat Uthappa pushing forward"
2.2,"Rajpoot to Uthappa, no run","short outside off, slapped to backward point"
2.1,"Rajpoot to Uthappa, FOUR runs","gets past Gayle at slip. Short of a length, shapes away, and Uthappa hangs his bat out to send an edge flying past Gayle, who doesn't quite leap as much. But it looked like a tough chance anyway"
1.6,"Mujeeb to Lynn, no run","darts in a length ball at pace on middle, and Lynn defends back"
1.5,"Mujeeb to Lynn, FOUR runs","short, flat, and spinning in, Lynn backs away and slaps it through point for four"
1.4,"Mujeeb to Lynn, no run",
1.3,"Mujeeb to Narine, OUT","in the air, and brilliant catch by Karun Nair. Looked for a moment as though this was the usual Narine, making merry against spin early on. It was a back-of-the-hand variant from Mujeeb, not quite the flipper, but it slides into Narine's pads, and he steps down the track and mows this over long-on. Nair moves to his right and slides in front to complete a brilliant catch"
1.2,"Mujeeb to Narine, no run","back of a length, slight turn away, Narine slaps it to point"

0.1,"Rajpoot to Lynn, 1 run","back of a length, shaping away outside off, Lynn reaches out and pats it to deep backward point"
18.3,"Karn to Laughlin, OUT","it's all over! Karn finishes with two wickets to his name. Good length outside off, and once again zipping straight through. The No. 11 tries to cut, but all he can get is a feather edge. Comfortably done by thala Dhoni as Chennai Super Kings win by 64 runs!"
18.2,"Karn to Unadkat, OUT","crashes into middle stump! Tossed up on middle, and this is the topspin from Karn. Unadkat misses the slog, and the ball sneaks under his bat. Nine down now"

16.6,"Karn to Unadkat, FOUR runs","inside out over cover! Slightly extra air given this time, and the ball is lifted over the infield with disdain. Get Unadkat up the order!"
16.5,"Karn to Gopal, 1 run","half-tracker on off stump, and once again heaved towards the leg side off the back foot. Billings is positioned there at cow corner"
16.4,"Karn to Unadkat, 1 run","good length on middle, and he swivels to whip it towards square leg"
16.3,"Karn to Gopal, 1 run","full on off stump, and Gopal comes walking down the wicket to tap it towards midwicket"
16.2,"Karn to Unadkat, 1 run","good length outside off, and sharp legspin. Tries to slog-sweep, but top-edges it towards the leg side. Falls short of deep midwicket"
16.1,"Karn to Gopal, 1 run","good length on off, and that's been pulled along the ground to deep midwicket"
15.6,"Thakur to Unadkat, FOUR runs","extra short on off stump, and too easy for the tall Unadkat. Swats this pull, and the ball races away to the cow-corner boundary"
15.5,"Thakur to Unadkat, no run","good length on off, and Unadkat's in no position to pull. Misses the shot, and the ball hits his gut. Looks like it's taken the wind out of his system. Unadkat needs a moment to recover"
15.4,"Thakur to Unadkat, no run","full on middle stump, and he check drives over the bowler's head. Lands just short of mid off"
15.3,"Thakur to Binny, OUT","Godly catch from Thakur! Short on off, and he tries to pull. The ball takes the top edge, and it's in the air for just a bit, as Thakur sprints, dives forward and then takes a one-handed stunner"
15.2,"Thakur to Gopal, 1 run",good length on off stump. The batsman goes deep into his crease before defending off the back foot
15.1,"Thakur to Binny, 1 run","full on off stump, and Binny muscles this past the non-striker to long on. CSK more than happy to give these singles"
14.6,"Watson to Gopal, no run","good length outside off, and Gopal opens his bat's face this time. Played to short third man"
14.5,"Watson to Gopal, no run","good length outside off, and Gopal's cut can only find the man at point"
14.4,"Watson to Gowtham, OUT","top edged to Dhoni! Short on off, and Gowtham tries to pull this over midwicket, but can only find the bat's edge. Great day for Watson"
14.3,"Watson to Binny, 1 run","back of a length on off, but sticks with the slower ball again. Mistimes his pull to the man in the deep this time"
14.2,"Watson to Binny, no run","deceived by the slower ball! Good length on the fourth-stump line, but Binny's through his cut shot too early"
14.1,"Watson to Gowtham, 1 run",back of a length on middle stump. Backs away and cuts to backward point to get off strike
13.6,"Tahir to Binny, 2 runs","full on off, and that's been carved towards backward point. Chase for the fielder in the deep, which allows Binny to come back for the second"
13.5,"Tahir to Stokes, OUT","Tahir has the last laugh! Tossed up on middle, and Stokes has no option but to slog sweep. Connected well, but doesn't have the distance. It's the longer part of the boundary on the leg-side, and therefore perishes for 45"
13.4,"Tahir to Stokes, SIX runs","full outside off, and spinning further away. They're trying to push it wider for Stokes, but he's up to the challenge tonight. Lifted inside out over cover"
13.3,"Tahir to Stokes, no run","good length on middle stump, rocks back and punches towards cover"
13.2,"Tahir to Binny, 1 run","full on off stump, and lifted over the non-striker. But man's there at long on"
13.1,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 run","full on off, and spinning away from Stokes. Drilled down the ground to long off"
12.6,"Bravo to Binny, FOUR runs","the extra ball gets punished! Overpitched on leg stump, and Binny does well to clip if fine off his toes. Races away to the fine-leg boundary. Time out as well"
12.5,"Bravo to Stokes, 1 run","overpitched on middle and leg, and Stokes comfortably flicks it off his pads to midwicket. Bravo keeping it tight"
12.4,"Bravo to Binny, 1 run","low full toss on off, but once again takes the pace off. Clipped off Binny's pads to deep midwicket for a walking single. CSK won't mid these"
12.3,"Bravo to Stokes, 1 run","low full toss just outside off. Stokes simply pushes it towards wide long off for a single. Wants two, but sent back by Binny"
12.2,"Bravo to Tripathi, OUT","full on off, and Tripathi goes for a wild leg-side heave. Tries to send it over deep midwicket, but comes off the bat's toe end. Billings, at cow corner, takes a few steps in front and completes the catch"
12.2,"Bravo to Tripathi, 1 wide","goes short and fast, but misses his line. Pitches on leg stump, but down the leg side. Another run added to the extras column"
12.1,"Bravo to Stokes, 1 run",back of a length on off stump. Stokes stays on his crease and punches off the back foot to cover
11.6,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 run","good length on off stump, and slapped past point to deep point. They're finding the men in the deep every time"
11.5,"Tahir to Tripathi, 1 run","full on middle and leg stump, and Tripathi comfortably taps it past the non-striker to Jadeja at long on"
11.4,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and spinning into Stokes. Worked off the back foot to midwicket on this occasion"
11.3,"Tahir to Stokes, 2 runs","full on middle stump, and this time Stokes thumps it past Tahir's left to long on. Two more runs collected"
11.2,"Tahir to Stokes, FOUR runs","Tahir lets it go, and Rayudu misfields as well! Tossed up on middle, and Stokes smacks it straight past Tahir. He chooses not to get his hand behind it, but Rayudu - at long off - can't intercept either"
11.1,"Tahir to Stokes, no run","good length on off, and spinning further away. Carved off the back foot to cover. Almost lost his balance there"
11.1,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 wide","full and wide outside off, trying to entice Stokes to go over the off side. He lets it go"
10.6,"Bravo to Tripathi, 2 runs","slower ball, full on middle stump. All Tripathi can do is drive towards long on for a single"
10.6,"Bravo to Tripathi, 1 wide","full on leg stump, and Tripathi misses the leg-side whip. The ball goes down the leg side for extras. Tripathi was out of his crease for a moment, and Dhoni took aim at the stumps. But Tripathi was in when the wickets were dislodged"
10.5,"Bravo to Stokes, 1 run","slower ball, full outside off. Pushed by Stokes towards cover for just a single"
10.4,"Bravo to Tripathi, 1 run","full and wide outside off, but that's another slower ball from Bravo. Driven firmly, and with the bat's open face, to deep point again"
10.3,"Bravo to Stokes, 1 run","full and straight on middle, Stokes takes a step forward and clips it off his toes to deep midwicket"
10.2,"Bravo to Tripathi, 1 run","another slower ball, full and wide outside off. Tripathi sticks his bat out and taps towards deep point"
10.1,"Bravo to Buttler, OUT","The DJ starts the party first ball! Offcutter, and short outside off. Buttler doesn't pick the pace up and tries to drag his pull. Takes the bat's toe end, goes in the air, and taken easily by first slip in the end. Royals spiraling downhill fast"
9.6,"Tahir to Buttler, 1 run","tries to reverse sweep, but checks his shot. Full on leg stump, forcing Buttler to pull out of the shot. Still manages to play it towards the right-hander's cover area"
9.5,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 run","half-tracker on off, and allows Stokes to flat-bat it past Tahir to long on. A loose delivery, that in all honestly, should've been deposited over cow corner"
9.4,"Tahir to Buttler, 1 run","full and wide outside off, and Buttler bunts this down the ground to long off"
9.3,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 run",flighted full and wide outside off. Stokes tries to drive away from his body and carves it to cover
9.2,"Tahir to Stokes, FOUR runs","gives it some air, and pitches full outside off. But Stokes backs away towards the leg side, and crunches this drive past extra cover!"
9.1,"Tahir to Stokes, 2 runs","full on middle stump, and that's been pushed to wide long on. Stokes wants two, but chooses not to eventually"
8.6,"Watson to Stokes, 1 run","low full toss wide outside off, driven straight to sweeper cover"
8.5,"Watson to Buttler, 1 run",inside edge dribbles out to fine leg. Offcutter coming in at the stumps from back of a length. He looks to cut through point
8.5,"Watson to Buttler, 1 wide",full and past the wide marker. Buttler was backing away to make room and let it go
8.4,"Watson to Stokes, 1 run",short offcutter on leg stump again. Thigh-high. Pulled straight to square leg
8.3,"Watson to Stokes, FOUR runs","poor ball, easy runs. Looks for the bouncer but he seems to be stuck halfway in an offcutter too. In the end it's a harmless ball on the hips and he swivels to drag this past short fine"
8.2,"Watson to Buttler, 1 run","short of a length outside off, slapped on the up to find sweeper cover"
8.1,"Watson to Stokes, 1 run","full outside off, leans in for a drive to long-off"
7.6,"Tahir to Buttler, SIX runs",nice. Classy from Buttler. To the pitch again. It's pushed flat at a leg stump line and he gets under it to launch it straight towards the sight screen
7.5,"Tahir to Buttler, 2 runs","length on leg stump, steps out and shovels this on the up to deep midwicket's left. Stokes calls for a risky second and dives to make his ground"
7.4,"Tahir to Buttler, FOUR runs","get out of the way, Stokes! Buttler steps out to meet this length ball on leg stump and thumps it back towards his partner who does superbly to get out of the way. Long-on won't get to it"
7.3,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 run","length on off stump, tapped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
7.2,"Tahir to Buttler, 1 run",floated up on a length at off stump. Clears the front leg and drags it out to deep midwicket off the inside half
7.1,"Tahir to Buttler, no run",full on off stump. Drilled back to the bowler on the bounce
6.6,"Chahar to Stokes, no run",beaten by an inswinger. This is a full toss swinging into the corridor. He looks to whip it but the ball has changed trajectory and beaten the inside edge
6.5,"Chahar to Buttler, 1 run","legcutter, back of a length outside off. Slapped powerfully towards extra cover where Rayudu is slow getting the barrier down and cops it right on the knee cap. You don't want a swelling there, it's awful he's going to limp off for some treatment oh no. He walks till the boundary line with the physio and changes his mind. Goes into deep midwicket"
6.4,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length outside off, spanked on the up to sweeper cover"
6.3,"Chahar to Buttler, 1 run","full on off stump, flicked to deep midwicket's right"
6.2,"Chahar to Buttler, 2 runs","length ball outside off, shuffles and flicks it between long-on and deep midwicket"
6.2,"Chahar to Buttler, 1 wide",bouncer. Dug in too short. He allows it to pass over his shoulder
6.2,"Chahar to Buttler, 1 wide","knuckle ball. Fired down leg side. Buttler was exposing the stumps in readiness for the ramp, but this was far too wide to make a connection"
6.1,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run","slower ball on a length, just outside off. Shuffles and clips on the up to long-on"
5.6,"Watson to Buttler, no run",beaten. Some natural variation from the surface. Watson's offcutter holds it's line outside off and goes past the bat as Buttler looks to slap this over midwicket
5.5,"Watson to Buttler, no run","length ball wide outside off. Dips in a touch, very late, as he lets this go"
5.4,"Watson to Buttler, no run",short of a length and wide outside off. Wafts at it and is beaten
5.3,"Watson to Stokes, 1 run",short of a length on off stump. Steps out and cramps himself. Drives straight to extra cover
5.2,"Watson to Stokes, no run",overpitched and slanted wide outside off. Leans in and drives off the toe-end to extra cover
5.1,"Watson to Stokes, no run","slower ball, back of a length on leg stump and tapped on the up to mid-on"
4.6,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run",looks like another knuckle ball. At a length and slanted in at middle stump. Tapped wide of mid-on
4.5,"Chahar to Stokes, no run","slower offcutter, dropped short and moving past the back shoulder. Stokes lets it go"
4.4,"Chahar to Buttler, 1 run",short of a length just outside off. Shuffles across and whips it to deep square
4.3,"Chahar to Rahane, OUT","knuckle ball to the top of middle! Rahane stepping out, getting outside the line of the stumps on the leg side, and swiping aimlessly while swivelling as he's beaten by pace by this short of a length ball. An ugly hoick would be describing it accurately, but it's been induced by a superbly disguised ball"
4.2,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run",short and in the corridor. Not enough room on the cut. Rayudu fumbles at backward point and they sneak in a run
4.1,"Chahar to Stokes, no run",length ball slanted across off stump. Looks to bludgeon it through cover on the up but he's gone too hard at it. Splices along the floor into the infield
3.6,"Thakur to Stokes, 1 run","slower on a length outside off, taps it on the up to extra cover who is right back on the circle"
3.5,"Thakur to Stokes, no run","short of a length on leg stump, walks at it and looks to whip it through the leg side. Cops it on the thigh guard ad is forced to quickly return to the crease as Thakur puts in a diving under-arm throw to hit the stumps"
3.4,"Thakur to Rahane, 1 run","short of deep square. Well directed bouncer. Rahane picks it up in front of his helmet, with his weight going forward. Ends up slicing it, one bounce"
3.3,"Thakur to Stokes, 3 runs","good length just outside off, walks into it as it slants across the corridor and clips it through midwicket off the inside half of the bat. Rahane calls confidently for the third"
3.2,"Thakur to Stokes, no run","good length wide outside off, left alone"
3.1,"Thakur to Rahane, 1 run","short ball just outside off, taps it on the up to cover point. Raina there. Has a shy at the non-striker's stumps, hits it too, and allows them a run off the deflection"
2.6,"Chahar to Samson, OUT","picks out deep square! Once again, Samson struggles to get on top of a short ball. He's shadow-practicing rolling the bat over it as he walks off, but was nowhere near in position to do that as this short one skidded in towards his underarm. Got it off the high part of the bat and Karn Sharma snaps up a simple one"
2.5,"Chahar to Samson, 2 runs",chips it wide of midwicket and deep square leg cleans up to his left. It's a bouncer at chest height and he gets under it on the hook
2.4,"Chahar to Rahane, 1 run","length on leg stump, early on the flick and he ends up chipping it past the square leg umpire"
2.3,"Chahar to Rahane, 2 runs","length on middle stump, shuffles and nudges it between the big space between long-on and deep square"
2.2,"Chahar to Rahane, no run",there is a review this time from CSK. Knuckle ball cuts in and hits Rahane on the back flap after appearing to beat the inside edge as he looks to flick. It's pitched outside off and come in not too bad on line. But it won't matter - it has got a bit of the inside edge. The review is lost.
2.1,"Chahar to Rahane, no run",a bit of wobble in the corridor. He gets nicely behind the line and taps on the up to mid-off
1.6,"Thakur to Samson, no run","full on middle and leg, and Samson misses the straight drive. Hits his front leg, and that's a big appeal for lbw! Turned down by the umpire, and CSK choose not to review. May have gone down the leg side ."
1.5,"Thakur to Klaasen, OUT","Thakur outclasses Klaasen! Good length on middle, and that's dead centre. He tries to defend this straight back to Shardul, but played down the wrong line. Crashes straight into middle stump"
1.4,"Thakur to Klaasen, 2 runs","follows the batsman on the leg side. Full outside leg after seeing Klaasen walk across to the leg side. Cramped for space, but manages to squeeze it towards midwicket"
1.3,"Thakur to Klaasen, no run","full on leg stump again, and Klaasen almost punishes this once more. Clipped off his toes, but straight to square leg"
1.2,"Thakur to Klaasen, no run","good length just outside off, and gets big on Klaasen. Defended off the backfoot to the bowler"
1.1,"Thakur to Klaasen, FOUR runs","full on middle, and angling into his toes. Too easy for Klaasen to simply flick it off his legs and past midwicket. Sloppy effort from Karn"
0.6,"Chahar to Rahane, FOUR runs","almost chops on again! Tight line on a good length, and Rahane tries punching towards cover again. The ball zips inwards and takes the inside edge. Through to the fine-leg boundary to end the over"
0.5,"Chahar to Rahane, SIX runs","check punched over long on! Full on off, and Rahane comes dancing down the wicket before smacking it over Chahar's head. Terrific shot"
0.5,"Chahar to Rahane, 1 wide","good length on leg stump, but goes down the leg side with Rahane shuffling across to the off side"
0.4,"Chahar to Rahane, no run","almost chopped on! Good length just outside off, and Rahane tries to punch towards cover. The ball comes just into him, and takes the inside of his bat. Lucky he didn't play that on"
0.3,"Chahar to Klaasen, 1 run",good length on off and angling into him. Turned off his pads to deep midwicket on this occasion
0.2,"Chahar to Klaasen, no run","dropped at first slip! Good length on off and shapes away after pitching. Klaasen tries to defend off the back foot but takes the outside edge of his bat. Straight to Watson, but he can't hold on"
0.1,"Chahar to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, which forces Rahane to tap it with soft hands towards the off side. Calls nice and early for the single"
0.1,"Chahar to Rahane, 1 wide","short and wide outside off. Rahane goes chasing after it, but can't cut it away. Through to the keeper, but the umpire reckons its too wide"
19.6,"Laughlin to Jadeja, 2 runs","yorker outside off, can't get under this for the slog. It dribbles wide of long-on who puts in a good throw on the bounce, but Laughlin can't collect this one-handed to effect the run out. Bravo would have been short"
19.5,"Laughlin to Watson, OUT",taken. Watson gets the front leg into the leg side to set up for the slog. Never a good strategy against Laughlin's away drifters. It's going too far away and he gets a thin edge that carries to Buttler. A sensational innings from Watson ends
19.4,"Laughlin to Bravo, 1 run","yorker outside off, jams it into the covers from deep in the crease"
19.4,"Laughlin to Bravo, 1 wide",slower ball pushed too far wide. It bends away and past the wide marker
19.3,"Laughlin to Bravo, 2 runs","length ball outside off, looks to pummel it inside-out over extra cover. Gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
19.3,"Laughlin to Bravo, 1 wide",bouncer dug in too short. He half-jabs at it. It's too high
19.2,"Laughlin to Bravo, no run",outside edge falls short of the keeper. Bravo going across the line after stepping out as Laughlin floats this one away from off
19.1,"Laughlin to Watson, 1 run",full slower ball outside off. Gets into the off side and tries to paddle it after meeting it on the full. Can only tap it straight to short fine
18.6,"Stokes to Bravo, FOUR runs",shot! Steps out and scythes it on the up over extra cover. Length ball fired in at off stump and he does stunningly to make so much room on this
18.5,"Stokes to Watson, 1 run",falls short of long-on. Watson not as fluent this over. It's a length ball on middle and it gets too big on him as he looks to slog. A feeble chip towards Gowtham who doesn't run in quickly enough
18.4,"Stokes to Watson, 2 runs",length ball angled in at middle stump. Slogs at it and gets it between deep square and deep midwicket off the inside half of the bat
18.3,"Stokes to Watson, no run",beaten. A full pace bouncer and he's too late on the hook
18.2,"Stokes to Bravo, 1 run","length on middle stump, walks down the pitch and chips it towards long-on"
18.1,"Stokes to Bravo, FOUR runs","drags it one-handed to deep square's right. He's done by the slower short ball, but the typical elongated hands as he looks to pull means he has a chance yet. Uses that left hand to place this"
17.6,"Unadkat to Watson, 2 runs",lands in front of third man where Gopal goes brilliantly to get his palm behind it as it lands to his right. An offcutter outside off that Watson tries to lift on the up over extra cover. Ends up slicing it high and Gopal puts in the dive but can't get his hand under that
17.5,"Unadkat to Bravo, 1 run",dropped by Sanju Samson at backward point. Jumping up with two hands but he can't hold on. This one flies off the face of the bat and it's a difficult one after Bravo's energetic swing for the cut
17.4,"Unadkat to Bravo, FOUR runs",lifts it over backward point. Offcutter dug in short of a length. He waits for it to come close and goes late at it and uses his wrists to lift this over
17.3,"Unadkat to Bravo, no run","beaten. Well bowled by Unadkat. Offcutter, back of a length on off stump. He shapes to slog but this skids through from under his shot"
17.2,"Unadkat to Watson, 1 run","century! Stays deep in the crease, allows the offcutter to come on and gently nudges it through cover to get his fourth T20 century. Fully in control tonight, the allrounder"
17.1,"Unadkat to Bravo, 1 run",length and angled in at leg stump. Flicked uppishly towards deep square
16.6,"Laughlin to Bravo, 1 run",good length ball floating away from off stump. Leans in and flicks it on the up towards deep midwicket
16.5,"Laughlin to Bravo, no run",short and wide outside off. Steps out and wafts. Can't make connection
16.4,"Laughlin to Bravo, no run","bouncer at an off stump line. Normal pace this time, he's forced to get his head out of the way"
16.3,"Laughlin to Bravo, FOUR runs","tickled past short fine. Superb stuff. He's expecting a short ball. It's also a slower ball though, so he's forced to adjust after leaping to get behind it. Still has the skill to get his hands in front of the body and run it fine"
16.2,"Laughlin to Watson, 1 run","length on middle stump, driven on the up to long-on"
16.1,"Laughlin to Watson, FOUR runs",past backward point! Laughlin with the trademark floater outside off. It's dropped short though. Watson is pristine tonight. Perfect weight transfer and timing on the back foot
15.6,"Gopal to Watson, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, punched to long-off off the back foot"
15.5,"Gopal to Watson, no run","googly, spinning into the corridor. He makes room to try and cut but this spins to take the under-edge and roll into the point region"
15.4,"Gopal to Watson, 2 runs","short ball on middle, backs away and punches to deep midwicket off the back foot"
15.3,"Gopal to Bravo, 1 run","slider, back of a length outside off. Gets on the back foot and taps to long-on"
15.2,"Gopal to Bravo, no run","good length ball outside off, blocked solidly on the front foot"
15.1,"Gopal to Billings, OUT","picks out deep midwicket. CSK are having something of a slide on the end opposite to Watson's. It's a half-tracker from Gopal. Which is smart of him, because that's how you get wickets in the IPL if you're a spinner now. Sits up nicely on middle stump and he slaps it, flat, to Stokes in the deep"
14.6,"Unadkat to Billings, 1 run",slower ball on a length on off stump. Backs away and has to adjust to tap this straight to mid-off. Wanted to drive that
14.5,"Unadkat to Watson, 1 run",dropped short again. Another offcutter. Outside off and he gets down to steer this to deep square
14.4,"Unadkat to Billings, 1 run","length ball wide outside off, lifts it on the up to extra cover on the bounce"
14.3,"Unadkat to Billings, no run","length outside off, walks into the shot and steers it straight to point"
14.2,"Unadkat to Watson, 1 run",cutter dropped short on middle stump. Drags the pull to deep square on the bounce
14.1,"Unadkat to Watson, FOUR runs",nicely played. Watson expertly finds the third man boundary. It's a cutter angled in at him. Not a lot of room there but he manages to arch backwards and chop it between keeper and short third
13.6,"Gopal to Watson, 1 run","googly, back of a length and in at leg stump. Goes deep in the crease and flicks towards deep square"
13.5,"Gopal to Billings, 1 run","googly, back of a length just outside off. Stays put and chops it to sweeper cover"
13.4,"Gopal to Billings, no run",back of a length ball on middle. Steps out and looks to shovel it through square leg but cops it on the thigh
13.3,"Gopal to Billings, no run","length on off stump, steps out and stabs it to extra cover"
13.2,"Gopal to Dhoni, OUT",he's taken at long-on! K Gowtham assists Gopal again. Just about. Dhoni steps out against the googly and is too close to it despite getting to the pitch of it at a good length in front of off. No room to swing and his attempted slog comes off the inside half and goes straight to Gowtham. He looks to take with a reverse-cup but eventually completes the catch after stretching to his right on the second attempt
13.1,"Gopal to Watson, 1 run","a googly, dropped short and coming in at leg stump. Gets low and drags it out to long leg with a pull"
12.6,"Binny to Dhoni, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and once again played delicately! Stays on the back foot and opens his bat's face to play the cut between backward point and short third man. Deft from Dhoni."
12.5,"Binny to Watson, 1 run","full on leg stump, and Watson's forced to wait for the ball to get to him. It's the slower one, and he flicks it off his toes to deep backward square"
12.4,"Binny to Watson, FOUR runs","half-tracker on off, and that's just way too easy for Watto. Rides the bounce and smacks this pull as square as one can imagine. Neither deep midwicket nor deep backward square can intercept"
12.4,"Binny to Watson, 1 wide","on leg stump, goes to pull this hard, but deceived by the pace. The ball goes down the leg side to the keeper"
12.3,"Binny to Watson, FOUR runs","good length just outside off, but Watson waits on the back foot. Cuts it late, and threads the gap between backward point and short third man"
12.2,"Binny to Watson, FOUR runs","good length on middle stump, and just too easy for Watson who moves on to 70. Going down the leg side, and he just glances this with soft hands down the leg side. Delicately played on this occasion"
12.1,"Binny to Dhoni, 1 run","overpitched on leg stump, and that's been flicked to fine leg to get off the mark"
11.6,"Gopal to Watson, no run","tossed up outside off, and it's the wrong'un. Spinning into Watson's body, but defended back to Gowtham"
11.5,"Gopal to Raina, OUT","excellent diving effort at deep midwicket! Gopal's gonna feel lucky here. It was overpitched on leg stump, and Raina's slog sweep is just mistimed. In the air for a while, before Gowtham runs forward and completes the catch. An all-Karnataka wicket there"
11.5,"Gopal to Raina, 1 wide","Nifty footwork from Raina! Half-tracker on leg  stump and Raina misses the pull. Hits the keeper, and falls back into Raina's pads. He isn't sure where the ball is, so chooses to wriggle the ball out of his body"
11.4,"Gopal to Raina, no run","quick! Half-tracker on off, and zipping straight across Raina. Tries to cut, but misses. 115 kph"
11.3,"Gopal to Raina, FOUR runs","tossed up outside off, and spinning further away from Raina. Enough width to free his arms, and he leans into this uppish drive over cover. No one at deep extra cover either"
11.2,"Gopal to Raina, no run","full on leg stump, gets down on one knee to slog sweep, but misses out. Hits his leg, but impact's outside leg stump"
11.1,"Gopal to Raina, FOUR runs","full on middle stump, and Raina gets down on one knee to lift it over cover. But, it's been sliced, and over point. No one in the deep there"
10.6,"Laughlin to Raina, 1 run","full on middle stump, and Raina's smart to simply play it down the ground for a single. It's already been an expensive over, and all they need to do is see the over out"
10.5,"Laughlin to Watson, 1 run","good length, just outside off. Worked towards the off side, and played off the back foot"
10.4,"Laughlin to Watson, SIX runs","pulled flat over midwicket! What a screamer this was. Short outside off, and he swivels quickly to get in position. Simply goes through with the shot, and that lands beyond the mid-wicket boundary"
10.3,"Laughlin to Raina, 1 run","full on leg, and Raina comfortably glances this fine down the leg side. Man in the deep though"
10.3,"Laughlin to Raina, 1 wide","misses his line completely. Slower ball, but short and outside leg stump, Raina tries to whip this fine behind leg but can't get bat to ball"
10.2,"Laughlin to Raina, FOUR runs","classic Raina! Good length on off, and he simply backs away before crunching this away from his body and past cover. Oof"

9.6,"Unadkat to Raina, FOUR runs","good length on middle stump, but Raina is quick to walk across to the off side, before whipping this over square leg! Unadkat expensive again"
9.5,"Unadkat to Raina, FOUR runs","back of a length on middle, but Raina's prepared for the length. Backs away towards the leg side, and simply cuts it over point's head. Safe shot, and also the fifty partnership"
9.4,"Unadkat to Watson, 1 run","around the wicket to Watson. Good length on off, and angling into him. Defended off the back foot towards the off side with ease"
9.3,"Unadkat to Raina, 1 run","goes back of a length again, and Raina taps it down the ground to long on. No real power, which perhaps, allows them to take the run in the end"
9.2,"Unadkat to Raina, no run","almost caught and bowled! But drops just short of Unadkat. It's back of a length on off, and the ball comes off the bat's top half. Lobs into the air, but falls before Unadkat could recover"

8.6,"Gowtham to Raina, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and Raina comfortably taps it towards square leg for a quick run. Expensive over"

8.2,"Gowtham to Watson, SIX runs","gets fifty with a six! Half-tracker on off, and Watson muscles this over long on. Stokes was getting under it, but the ball was simply too high"
8.1,"Gowtham to Raina, 1 run","back of a length on off stump. Tapped to mid on for a quick run, but it could've been a run out! Gowtham ran towards the ball, and then throws it towards the non-striker's end, but the ball slips out of his hand. Oh dear"
7.6,"Gopal to Raina, 1 run","full on leg once again, but this time Raina connects with the sweep. Hit straight to deep backward square. He'll keep strike"

7.1,"Gopal to Watson, 1 run","full on off, and that's been struck down the ground hard to long on"
6.6,"Gowtham to Watson, 1 run","tossed up, just outside off, and Watson's tempted to hit it straight. Played on the up, but lands just short of long off!"
6.5,"Gowtham to Raina, 1 run","short on middle, and Raina simply clips it off his pads to deep midwicket. They walk across for the run"

5.6,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR runs","four in a row! Good length on off, and Raina simply sticks his bat out. Gets a thick outside edge as the ball flies past the keeper's left. Time out as well"
5.5,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR runs","low full toss outside leg stump, and this is just too easy for Raina. Simply gets his bat to ball, and clips it off his toes fine down the leg side"
5.4,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR runs","flicked fine down the leg side! Back-of-a-length on leg stump, and Raina walks across to the off side, before whipping this fine past short fine leg"

5.2,"Stokes to Raina, no run","overpitched on middle stump, but Raina defends it straight back to Stokes"
5.1,"Stokes to Raina, no run","appeal for lbw, but turned down! Good length on middle stump and Raina tries to defend off the back foot. Takes the inside edge and ricochets onto his pads"
4.6,"Laughlin to Raina, 1 run","short on off, tried to pull but lobbed wide of mid on. Slightly in the air, but no fielder there for any trouble."
4.5,"Laughlin to Watson, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and turned off the backfoot to deep midwicket. They walk across for the single"
4.4,"Laughlin to Raina, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and tapped off his pads to midwicket. Gets off the mark"

4.2,"Laughlin to Watson, 1 run","good length on off stump, and that's been turned off his pads to midwicket. Calls early for the single"
4.1,"Laughlin to Rayudu, 1 run","full on middle stump, and slight outswing first up. Driven down the ground to mid on for a quick single"
3.6,"Stokes to Watson, FOUR runs","full ball, but on leg stump. Too easy for Watson, who simply clips it off his toes fine down the leg side. Eleven off Stokes' first over"
3.5,"Stokes to Rayudu, 1 run","good length just outside off. Rayudu opens his bat's face and carves towards point. Not hit well enough, but still allows them to take the run"
3.4,"Stokes to Rayudu, no run","good length, but wide outside off. Rayudu sticks his bat out - to try and play this fine - but can't connect"
3.3,"Stokes to Watson, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump. Clipped off the backfoot to midwicket for a quick run. Could be dangerous, but Tripathi can't connect with a direct-hit"
3.2,"Stokes to Rayudu, 1 run",back of a length on middle and cramps Rayudu for space. Forced to tap back towards the non-striker for a quick run
3.1,"Stokes to Rayudu, FOUR runs","back of a length on off, and Rayudu pulls this fine! Shuffles across to the off side, and whips this behind square"
2.6,"Unadkat to Watson, SIX runs","pulled over cow corner! Short on middle, and Watto is quick to get in position. Swivels, and then smacks this over midwicket. Flat six to end the over"
2.5,"Unadkat to Watson, no run","full on off, and takes the pace off this time (119 kph). It's the cutter, in fact, and Watson defends with soft hands. Carefully played"
2.4,"Unadkat to Watson, no run","good length on off stump, and Watson misses out on the cut. Mistimed towards the off side"
2.3,"Unadkat to Watson, SIX runs","overpitched outside off, and the angle allows Watson to free his arms. Just takes a step forward and lifts it over cover"
2.2,"Unadkat to Watson, no run",good length on off but too close to his body for the cut. Comes off the bat's top half and towards point
2.1,"Unadkat to Watson, no run","full on off stump, and angling across the batsman. Driven expansively, but stopped by Samson at cover. Good energy on display from the Royals fielders"
1.6,"Gowtham to Watson, 1 run","was that dropped? Excellent effort by Tripathi at point, but the ball may just have dropped short. It was short outside off, and Watson tried to muscle a cut towards the off side"
1.5,"Gowtham to Watson, SIX runs","tossed up outside off, and enough width for the big man. Big wind up of the bat, and thumped over Gowtham's head. Off the bat's toe end, but enough muscle behind that shot"
1.4,"Gowtham to Watson, 2 runs","full on middle, and Watson takes a big stride forward. Gets to the pitch of the ball and slog-sweeps to Stokes at deep midwicket. A good, sliding effort from Stokesy"

0.6,"Binny to Rayudu, FOUR runs","crunched over cover! Overpitched outside off, and just a full followthrough of the bat from Rayudu. Played on the up, and comfortably lifted over the infield"
0.5,"Binny to Watson, 1 run","dropped at first slip! Tripathi the guilty party. Good length on off, and just shaping away. Watson tried to drive to cover but he plays it with hard hands, and the ball takes a thick outside edge. Tripathi was quick to move to his right, but the ball just pops out"
0.4,"Binny to Watson, no run","half-tracker outside off, but angling away once again. Watson's happy to tap it off the backfoot to point"
0.3,"Binny to Watson, no run",good length just outside off. Watson shuffles onto his backfoot and defends
0.2,"Binny to Watson, FOUR runs","back of a length outside off, and angling away from Watson. Enough room for him to free his arms, and it's been caressed past cover off the back foot. The diving effort from cover not good enough"

19.6,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run",steps out and punches this to deep cover.  Third win in four games for Kings XI.  This is also the first time they've won in Mohali. Emphatic win.
19.5,"Ashwin to Shakib, 1 run","has he cleared the ropes, no. Put down by Mujeeb at deep midwicket. This was a dolly."
19.4,"Ashwin to Shakib, SIX runs","another monstrous hit! Right in the slot, this time he fetches this from well outside off and swings this over the ropes at long on."
19.3,"Ashwin to Shakib, SIX runs","punished! Right in the slot, Shakib belts this to clear long on. Crrrrrraaack"

18.2,"Sharma to Pandey, SIX runs","he connects one, finally. In the slot and Pandey drills this to clear long-on. Half-century goes unnoticed"

16.4,"Tye to Hooda, OUT","how high? Very, very high but he's only hoicked this as far as deep midwicket, who was at least 20 yards in. Hooda had to go from ball one, can't blame him there. Another knuckleball has given Tye a wicket."

14.3,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run",steps out and mistimes this flat-batted hit down to long on
14.2,"Tye to Williamson, OUT","holes out to long off. Stepped out and looked to loft over long off but ended up slicing it, which meant there was no timing. Skewed it high in the air, Finch took a comfortable catch. The knuckleball meant Williamson didn't have any pace to work with."

13.3,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run"," just short of Tiwary  coming in from long on. Almost made a difficult catch possible. Outstanding effort, came in quickly and dived full length forward to take it on the half volley"
13.3,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 wide",anticipates the batsman stepping out and bowls this short and wide.
13.2,"Ashwin to Pandey, 2 runs",steps out and nudges this towards Mohit coming in from deep square. A fumble there helped them to complete it easily
13.1,"Ashwin to Williamson, 1 run",steps out and swings this down to long on
12.6,"Sharma to Pandey, FOUR runs",slices this length ball between cover point and short third man. Wonderfully done. Steps out and then opened the bat face slightly to pick the gap.
12.5,"Sharma to Williamson, 1 run","flat-bats this over the bowler's head, excellent work by Agarwal at long-on. Pandey was more than halfway down the pitch as he turned, Rahul was late in coming up to the stumps. Some angry words from Agarwal, Rahul says he didn't hear much."

12.3,"Sharma to Pandey, 2 runs","gets across and wrists this length ball towards deep square, purposeful running"
12.2,"Sharma to Pandey, FOUR runs",swung away leg side. This was a knee-high full toss and he clobbered that to the square leg boundary. Suspect Mohit was looking to bowl a yorker.
12.1,"Sharma to Pandey, 2 runs","crunched to sweeper cover, lazy effort in the deep by Tiwary. Looped in a throw, they came back for the second easily"

11.1,"Mujeeb to Williamson, 1 run","looks to play a half-sweep to a shortish delivery that drifts in, beaten. Hit on the pad"

10.5,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run","bunts this towards cover, they scamper a single"
10.4,"Tye to Williamson, 1 leg bye","gets a little too far across to paddle, can't get much bat on it. Straight to the keeper"
10.3,"Tye to Williamson, no run","slower length ball n off stump, defended from the crease"
10.2,"Tye to Pandey, 1 run"," dropped  by substitute David Miller at long-on!  He stepped out to loft over long-on but didn't get the elevation. Miller ran in quickly, dived low but couldn't get under it properly."

9.1,"Mujeeb to Williamson, no run","comes a long way down the track in trying to work this flatter delivery to the leg side as he swings across the line, is struck on the pad. There was a stifled appeal, but Ashwin went up for a review immediately. Ball tracker says this would have clipped the outside of leg stump.  On-field decision of NOT OUT stays "
8.6,"Ashwin to Williamson, 1 run",punches this down to long of as he jogs the single
8.5,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","hoicked acoss the line, one bounce to deep midwicket"

8.2,"Ashwin to Williamson, 1 run","drops short with the carrom ball, Williamson rocks back and cuts to sweeper cover"
8.1,"Ashwin to Williamson, SIX runs",beauty! Excellent use of the feet as he gets underneath the flight and swings this over long on
7.6,"Mujeeb to Pandey, no run","good length outside off, and spinning sharply into him. Tries to work it towards the leg side but played down the wrong line. Goes straight through to the keeper"

7.4,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run","full on off, and spins sharply inwards. Worked off his legs to deep midwicket"
7.3,"Mujeeb to Williamson, 1 run","quicker ball. Good length on middle, but KW comes down the wicket to work it towards midwicket. No one there, while means Mujeeb has to go chasing behind it"

7.1,"Mujeeb to Williamson, 1 run","good length on off, and spinning into his body. Punched off the back foot to long on for a walking single"
6.6,"Ashwin to Williamson, 1 run","good length, but wide outside off. Cuts it off the back foot to the man in the deep. He'll keep strike"
6.5,"Ashwin to Williamson, FOUR runs","full on middle and leg, and he comes down the wicket almost like a ballet dancer. Simple skip, and then lifted inside out over extra cover. Can watch that all day"
6.4,"Ashwin to Williamson, 2 runs","good length on off, but KW backs away towards the leg side. Carves it square with soft hands, which allows them to come back for the second"
6.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, 2 wide",and the first legbreak doesn't turn the way he wants to. Full outside leg and going down the leg side. Rahul can't hold on to it either
6.3,"Ashwin to Williamson, 1 run","good length on off stump, and no spin on offer for now. He comes down the wicket and bunts it towards midwicket"
6.2,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run",tossed up on leg stump. Pandey backs away and drives inside out to long off. Dealing in ones and twos for now
6.1,"Ashwin to Williamson, 1 run","good length on off, and zips straight through. Punched off the back foot to long on"
5.6,"Barinder Sran to Pandey, no run","good length on off, and angling across Pandey again. Tries to open his bat's face but can't connect. Through to Rahul, who can't hold onto it in his first attempt"

4.5,"Sharma to Pathan, 2 runs","short outside off, and once again jagging away from Yusuf. He flat-bats it over mid on, and it's a chase for the fielder towards the long-on boundary. Eventually comfortably pulled back"
4.4,"Sharma to Pathan, no run","short, but jags away from Yusuf after pitching. He contemplates pulling but pulls out in the end. The ball ends up just inside the tramlines"
4.3,"Sharma to Williamson, 1 leg bye","full on leg stump, and he can't flick it fine. Tries to work it to the leg side but hits his pad instead. Impact outside leg stump, however"
4.2,"Sharma to Pathan, 1 run","too short. Outside off, and Pathan drags his pull to cow corner"
4.1,"Sharma to Pathan, FOUR runs","slapped past cover! Good length outside off, and just enough room for Yusuf to free his arms. Muscles this past the two infielders on the off side on this occasion"

3.5,"Tye to Pathan, 1 run","overpitched on off stump, and that's been drilled to mid off. Quick run collected"
3.4,"Tye to Pathan, FOUR runs","slower ball, but overpitched on leg stump. Too easy for Pathan who uses his long levers to whip this over midwicket. No one in the deep there"

3.2,"Tye to Pathan, 1 run","good length on middle stump, stays on the back foot and tapped to mid on for a single"
3.1,"Tye to Pathan, no run","good length on off, and starts with the slower one. Tries to punch this back but he's through his shot too early. Forced to check his shot, and that probably saves him. The ball drops just short of Tye"
2.6,"Barinder Sran to Williamson, no run","good length on middle and angling away once again. Crunches this drive square, but Yuvraj - yes that man - dives to his right and stops"

1.6,"Sharma to Pathan, FOUR runs","just over Ashwin! Full on off, and he tries to lift it over mid off. Not hit well at all, but the tall Ashwin can't get his fingertips to it either. Reprieve for Yusuf"
1.5,"Sharma to Saha, OUT","clips off stump! Sharma has the final laugh. Good length on off stump, and straight as an arrow. Saha tried the pull this square, but the ball stays low, and the delivery crashes into side of off stump"
1.4,"Sharma to Saha, FOUR runs","slower ball, but a half-tracker on middle. He has all the time in the world to swivel and paddle this fine past short fine leg! Good use of the wrists from Saha to play this finer than usual"
1.3,"Sharma to Williamson, 3 runs","good length on middle stump, and KW easily whips it off his pads to deep midwicket. The man there has to race across the boundary to intercept. Good work from Mujeeb"
1.2,"Sharma to Williamson, FOUR runs","good length just outside off, and KW rides the bounce! Stands tall and punches this past cover. What a glorious shot"
1.1,"Sharma to Saha, 1 run",good length on middle stump. Comfortably flicked off his pads to square leg for a single
0.6,"Barinder Sran to Williamson, no run",good length on off stump. Williamson makes a customary off-side shuffle and fends towards the leg side
0.5,"Barinder Sran to S Dhawan, no run","good length on off, and gets big on Dhawan. He tries to cut but the ball came in sharply. Cramped for space, and the ball hits his left elbow. That hurt! Physio time. The way Dhawan reacted, looked pretty painful. He's retiring hurt."
0.4,"Barinder Sran to Saha, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and that's been pulled square. Not him well enough though"
0.3,"Barinder Sran to Saha, no run","good length on middle, and that's been driven uppishly. Through his shot too early and hits the bat's top half. In the air as well, but just short of cover point. Three men inside the circle on the off side, but falls short of all three of them"
0.2,"Barinder Sran to Saha, no run","good length on leg stump, and shapes into his pads. Tries to flick towards the leg side but misses. Hits his front leg, but the lbw appeal is turned down. They're reviewing anyway Is it too high, that's the only question  and yes! Slightly too high. Would've clipped the stumps, but that's umpire's call"
0.1,"Barinder Sran to Saha, no run",good length on off and angling away from Saha. Sticks his bat out and cuts to point. Diving effort from Agarwal stops the single
0.1,"Barinder Sran to Saha, 1 wide",awry start. Good length outside leg and shaping further away
19.6,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, 1 run","looks to go over long-on, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad. Saha fires a wayward throw at the bowler's end and they get a single.  Gayle is applauded by the opponents as he walks off.  What entertainment."
19.5,"Rashid Khan to Finch, 1 run","pulled away, not in control. Deep square does well to come around."
19.4,"Rashid Khan to Finch, SIX runs",right underneath the flight and bang! Straight into the sightscreen. The power of his bottomhand. Proper smash
19.3,"Rashid Khan to Finch, FOUR runs",muscled! One bounce and this bisects deep midwicket and long on. Proper baseball slog. Cleared the front leg and boom!
19.2,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, 1 run","slaps this length ball to long off. For a second, Gayle didn't want a single but trudged along"
19.1,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run","has he got him? Gayle looks to biff this over midwicket, misses. Struck on the pad"

18.4,"Kaul to Gayle, 1 run","high full toss, Gayle looks to go over cover but is hit high on the bat, they scamper a run. Gayle had given up. A direct hit and he was gone"
18.3,"Kaul to Finch, 1 run",slaps this length delivery down to long on
18.2,"Kaul to Gayle, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, Gayle bunts this behind point to scamper a single.  This is his sixth IPL century, his 21st in T20s overall.  Brings out the cradle celebration, probably for his daughter who is here in India.  First century of the season "
18.1,"Kaul to Finch, 1 run","slower and fuller outside off, Finch belts this to long-off.  He's off the mark and there's an arm raise  even as the crowd gives him a big cheer. Finch sees the funny side of it"
17.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, SIX runs",gets underneath the length and hammers this into the top tier at long-off.  This is the first time Bhuvi has finished a four-over spell before the 19th over. 
17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, no run",helps this trash ball down leg on the bounce to short fine leg. Missed out
17.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Nair, OUT","think I jinxed him, Nair has hoicked this straight to deep midwicket, but this has been a good support hand. Bhuvi bowled this knuckleball at length outside off, Nair fetched it and tried to clear the longest boundary, picked out Dhawan."
17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, 1 run","full and wide again, squeezed to cover"
17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, 1 wide","backs away, so Bhuvi goes full and wide, Gayle can't reach it but this is outside the wide line. Has to rebowl that"
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Nair, 1 run","sliced over the infield, down to Rashid at sweeper cover"
17.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, 1 run",driven wide of extra cover for a quick single
16.6,"Jordan to Nair, no run","looks to walk across and whip this over square leg, played too early. Flicked the back pad on the way to the keeper"
16.5,"Jordan to Nair, no run","excellent wide yorker, Nair looks to carve this behind point but is late on the stroke"
16.4,"Jordan to Nair, FOUR runs","mid-off is inside the ring, so Nair has the license to go over the top and he does full justice to it. Jordan goes length, Nair makes room and goes inside-out. Lovely"
16.3,"Jordan to Gayle, 1 run",driven to long-off
16.2,"Jordan to Gayle, SIX runs","this is Gayle unleashed. Waited, held his shape and belted this short ball over the deep square leg fence. This one not as big as some of the others, but doesn't matter.  This is his 10th six this season. Only Russell has more sixes in an innings this season "
16.1,"Jordan to Nair, 1 run","right into the blockhole, just a touch outside off, Nair walks across and squeezes the drive past mid off"
16.1,"Jordan to Nair, 1 wide","length ball but way outside the wide line, easy call"
15.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Nair, 1 run",opens the bat face slightly to drive this towards cover point
15.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, 1 run","squeezes this length ball towards point, Gayle is on a mission to not just hit boundaries but pinch ones and twos as well"
15.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Nair, 1 run","walks across the stumps to help this over short fine, gets some glove on it as he looks to play this slower legcutter, didn't have pace to work with"
15.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, 1 run",punches this down to long on for an easy single
15.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, 2 runs","length ball on leg stump, dabbed past a laboured Rashid at midwicket. Lazy, lazy effort. Nothing lazy about the running from Gayle"
15.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, 2 runs","length delivery angling away, steered behind point, down to square third man"
14.6,"Kaul to Gayle, 1 run","superb yorker length ball on leg stump, Gayle squeezes this towards deep midwicket"
14.5,"Kaul to Gayle, no run",squeezes this full-length delivery to point
14.4,"Kaul to Nair, 1 run","slower and fuller on the pads, worked past midwicket"
14.3,"Kaul to Nair, FOUR runs","backs away, Kaul drops this just a touch short but the result is the same as Nair flat-bats this over mid-off. The angle brought it in, Nair, it appeared was cramped for room, but he manufactured the stroke by opening his wrists to get this up and over."
14.2,"Kaul to Nair, FOUR runs","clean strike, one bounce to the long off boundary. Made room and lofted through the line. Mid off was up, decided to clear him and did so superbly"
14.1,"Kaul to Nair, 2 runs","length ball back in, Nair mistimes this hoick over midwicket. This raises the half-century stand off just 23 balls"
13.6,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, 2 runs","punched back, Rashid parries this deflection towards midwicket. I haven't seen Gayle hare like this in a long long time, how did he complete the second? Woah!"
13.5,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, SIX runs","this has been muscled over cow corner. He's well and truly back. This is some assault. Rashid drifted this in full from wide of the crease, Gayle got right to the pitch on the sweep as he made clean connection!"
13.4,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, SIX runs","goes full, but it doesn't matter. Lofted through the line, stunning use of the bottom hand, clean striking. Just above the sightscreen this time. Some attack this against the top dog in T20 cricket"
13.3,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, SIX runs","drops short, Gayle responds by using the depth of the crease to clobber this back over his head, smashes into the sightscreen"
13.2,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, SIX runs","he's now in his big-hitting zone. Too full and right into his swinging arc, Gayle hammers this with the turn over long off."
13.1,"Rashid Khan to Nair, 1 run",works this from length towards deep midwicket
12.6,"Jordan to Nair, 1 run","knee-high full toss on middle stump, and it's been flicked off his pads to fine leg. Could've sent that anywhere on the leg side, but could only find the man in the deep"
12.5,"Jordan to Nair, no run","quicker ball! Back of a length on middle and cramps Karun for space. Tries to flick it towards midwicket, but can't connect. Hits his gut region"
12.4,"Jordan to Nair, no run","back of a length outside off, and coming into Karun Nair. Stays on the backfoot and carves it towards point. Man there"
12.3,"Jordan to Gayle, 1 run",good length on off and angling away from Gayle. Slapped off the back foot to the man in the deep
12.2,"Jordan to Nair, 1 run",good length just outside off. Karun Nair opens the bat's face and pushes it towards deep extra cover. Happy to give the strike back to Gayle
12.1,"Jordan to Gayle, 1 run","yorker on leg stump, and Gayle just taps it to midwicket for a single. Second fifty in a row!"
11.6,"Shakib to Gayle, 1 run","full and wide outside off. Gayle's forced to reach at it, and drags the shot to midwicket"
11.5,"Shakib to Gayle, SIX runs","good length on leg, but in Gayle's arc! Takes a big stride forward and thumps it over Manish Pandey at long on."

11.3,"Shakib to Gayle, no run","full on off, and bunted back to Shakib off the back foot"
11.2,"Shakib to Nair, 1 run","full on off stump, and drilled down the ground to long on"
11.1,"Shakib to Nair, SIX runs","chance goes down! Difficult but Manish Pandey's effort goes for a six. Full on off, and he lifts it over mid on. Pandey - at long on - gets under it, and even sticks his hand out. The ball stays in his palm, but his momentum's taking him over the boundary. Still manages to throw the ball in the air, but his inertia forces the ball to land beyond the boundary anyway"
10.6,"Kaul to Nair, 1 run",good length on off and angling into Karun. Flicked off his pads to deep midwicket for a comfortable run
10.5,"Kaul to Gayle, 1 run",half-tracker on off and angling further away. Gayle stands tall and flat-bats it hard to long off. They walk across for the run
10.4,"Kaul to Gayle, no run","back of a length outside off. Gayle tries to slap it square past point, but the bounce stays low! Under-edges it towards the off side"
10.3,"Kaul to Nair, 1 run","good length, just outside off. Punched off the front foot to deep extra cover. Dhawan the man there"
10.2,"Kaul to Agarwal, OUT","soft! Back of a length outside off, and enough width to free his arms. But Mayank tries to play a deft shot, and cuts it straight to point. He'll be disappointed"
10.1,"Kaul to Gayle, 1 run","slower ball, wide outside off. Gayle is forced to reach at it, and bunts it to deep extra cover"
9.6,"Shakib to Gayle, 1 run","and that's the quickest I've seen Gayle run in a while. Good length on leg, and he clips it to square leg for a quick single. Giant steps across the 22 years means he completes it with ease"
9.5,"Shakib to Agarwal, 1 run","tries to repeat it, but can only mistime it down the ground to long on. Full on off, and played down the ground again"
9.4,"Shakib to Agarwal, SIX runs","slogged over long on! Slower ball, gives it just a bit more air, and the full ball is in Agarwal's arc. Gets down on one knee, and smacks this over the non-striker's head"
9.3,"Shakib to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length on leg stump, and aimed at Gayle's legs. Punched off the back foot to cow corner for a walking single"
9.2,"Shakib to Agarwal, 1 run",good length on off stump. Mayank goes onto the back foot and punches it past Shakib's left to long off
9.1,"Shakib to Agarwal, FOUR runs","welcomed with a boundary! Full just outside off, and Mayank takes a big step forward before lifting this inside out over cover. A well-executed shot that's played wide of long off"
8.6,"Hooda to Agarwal, 1 run","full on off, and swept square. Spinning into Agarwal's pads, and comfortably gets down on one knee to play it to the man in the deep. Time out"
8.5,"Hooda to Gayle, 1 run","full on off, and Gayle tries to launch off again. Only this time he mis-hits it to cow corner, trying to slog through the ball's line"
8.4,"Hooda to Agarwal, 1 run","good length on off, and Agarwal muscles this off the back foot to midwicket. Mistimed"
8.3,"Hooda to Agarwal, FOUR runs","tossed up on off, and Agarwal tries an extravagant drive. Takes a thick outside edge, and loops over to short third man. Yusuf attempts a dive to his right, but the ball bounces in front of him and then races away to the boundary"
8.2,"Hooda to Gayle, 1 leg bye","good length on middle stump, and Gayle shuffles across to the off side. Tries to flick it behind square but misses. Hits his thigh pad, and allows them to rotate the strike"
8.1,"Hooda to Gayle, SIX runs","tossed up on off, and too easy for Gayle! One big step forward and then comfortably lifted over the bowler's head. Lands beyond the long-on boundary"
8.1,"Hooda to Gayle, 1 wide",overpitched and wide outside off. Just inside the tramlines as Gayle chooses not to play at it. Smart bowling
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, no run","full outside off, but spins sharply into Agarwal. Blocked off the back foot with the bat's open face. Excellent over from Rashid"
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, OUT","trapped in front of middle and off! Half-tracker outside off and holds its line. Too quick for Rahul, and the ball stays low too, as the batsman misses the leg-side whip. Goes under his bat, and hits his front leg. An easy call for the umpire"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, no run","good length, just outside off. Spins slightly away from Rahul, and he's forced to go deep onto the back foot and defend"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, 1 run","not afraid to flight it, and lucky Gayle mistimes it. Landed full outside off, and he tries to slog towards the leg side, but off the bat's toe end. Goes to cow corner"
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run","good length on off, but spins sharply into Gayle. Cramped for room, and forced to flat-bat it back to Rashid"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run","flighted on off stump, and Rahul takes a step forward to nudge it towards midwicket for a quick run"
6.6,"Hooda to Gayle, no run","full outside off, and angling into Gayle's pads. He takes a big step forward and tries to flick it towards the leg side, but the ball straightens slightly and hits his front leg. Appeal turned down. Impact outside off, perhaps"
6.5,"Hooda to Gayle, no run","full and fast outside off, and Gayle thumps this to cover. Straight to the man there"
6.4,"Hooda to Gayle, no run","good length on middle, and angling into his pads. Tries to paddle it fine behind square, but he's though the shot too early. Hits his front leg, and Hooda appeals too, but it would've gone down leg"
6.3,"Hooda to Rahul, 1 run","half-tracker wide outside off. Rahul walks down the wicket to generate some extra pace, and slaps it to deep extra cover"
6.2,"Hooda to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length outside off, Gayle comes walking down the wicket and flat-bats it to mid on"
6.1,"Hooda to Gayle, no run","around the wicket, and on a good length. Pushed towards cover"
5.6,"Kaul to Rahul, FOUR runs",lofted  beautifully over mid-off. Impeccable balance and timing. Great to watch. How he can't be a regular for India across format continues to baffle me
5.5,"Kaul to Rahul, FOUR runs",this is a crunching cover drive. Pierced the gap to perfection. Not a half-volley by any means and he hit through the line without a trace of worry.
5.4,"Kaul to Gayle, 1 run","mistimes an attempted punch down to mid-off, Gayle is on the ball today, gets across for a single"
5.3,"Kaul to Rahul, 1 run","the knuckleball that he lands at length on off, punched to mid off for a quick single"

5.1,"Kaul to Gayle, 1 run",bunts this short of length delivery to cover
4.6,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, 1 run","looks to go over cover, gets a thick inside edge down to long-on. This time, he was made to really stretch, didn't get to the pitch either."
4.5,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, SIX runs","gets to the pitch of the ball and clobbers this over wide long-on. Got so close, so it didn't matter if the delivery was a legspinner or a googly. Stunning blow, pure muscle."
4.4,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run",punches this shortish wrong'un to cover
4.3,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run","excellent comeback! Gayle didn't pick that googly at all, beaten."
4.2,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, SIX runs",juicy full toss and Gayle wallops this into the stands beyond deep midwicket. Too easy.
4.1,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run"," dropped by Saha!  Right off the toe end, tough chance. Gayle looked to cut but this kept a touch low."
3.6,"Jordan to Rahul, no run",squirts this drive to Rashid at cover point
3.5,"Jordan to Gayle, 1 run",that old-school Natraja shot that Kapil Dev mastered. Right leg in the air as he hops back and works this to deep square leg
3.4,"Jordan to Gayle, FOUR runs","slaps this over cover point. Too short and angling away, Gayle cleared his front leg to wallop this."
3.3,"Jordan to Gayle, SIX runs","he was waiting for that, deposits this pull in front of square. Sails over deep midwicket. Was Jordan testing the bounce of the surface? Gayle got into position very quickly."
3.2,"Jordan to Rahul, 1 run","slower length ball on off stump, Rahul check-drives to mid-off. Shaped to hit through the line but changed his stroke as the ball held up on the surface"
3.1,"Jordan to Rahul, no run",shapes to drive but this ball veers back in to roll back off the inside edge.
2.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, no run",plays inside the line as this length ball nips away to whizz past the outside edge. Top stuff from Bhuvi
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, 1 run",mistimes a big booming drive towards mid off as they scamper a single
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","skiddy length ball on the stumps, Rahul shows the full face of the bat as he defends."
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","angles this full delivery into middle and leg, Rahul works this gently towards midwicket"
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","length ball angling in, there's a gentle little nip back in off the pitch to kiss the inside edge as it hit the pad.  A very thin inside edge!  Decision overturned. As an umpire, it's really, really hard to spot such minute deviation off the bat. Correct decision in the end."
2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, FOUR runs","drifting into the pads, Rahul flicks this past an ageing Yusuf, who fails to get there running back from midwicket. A slightly-more agile fielder would've stopped it on the dive"
1.6,"Jordan to Gayle, no run",gets on top of the bounce and punches this short of length delivery to mid-off
1.5,"Jordan to Gayle, 2 runs","just eludes Kaul at mid-on! This got big on Gayle as he shaped to fetch this pull from outside off, got this on the top part of the bat. Ah, so near, yet so far."

1.3,"Jordan to Gayle, no run","angles a zippy short of length delivery across Gayle, who drops his wrists and lets this go"
1.2,"Jordan to Gayle, 4 leg byes","brushes the thigh pad and beats the diving Saha down leg. A short of length delivery but pitched way down leg. Gayle looked to work it fine, but will take runs however they come."

0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, 1 run","gentle little tuck to square leg, Gayle hares across to get off the mark."
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, 1 run","leading edge, squirts down to square third man. Rahul looked to work this full delivery to the leg side but didn't account for the late away movement."
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","excellent take down leg by Saha. Bhuvi gets the direction wrong. Sprays this length ball down leg, brushed the thigh pad on the way to the keeper"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run",gets a good stride forward and defends this away-swinger to cover
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","uppish, but on the bounce to mid-off. Nice curve again on the knuckleball. Stopped on Rahul and hit the top part of the bat as he looked to drive."
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","curves away from off stump, driven firmly. Good stop at extra cover"
18.5,"Laughlin to Karthik, SIX runs","and that is that. Gets a full ball from Laughlin, just outside off, and he clears his front leg and launches the winning hit high into the Jaipur sky, well beyond the long-on boundary"
18.4,"Laughlin to Rana, 1 run","slower short ball outside off. Makes a bit too much room, ends up having to reach for it, at shoulder height that too, and chops it down towards point"
18.3,"Laughlin to Karthik, 1 run","slower ball, full outside off, whipped wristily down to long-on"
18.2,"Laughlin to Rana, 1 run","slower ball on leg stump. Was he looking to chip that towards long-off? Maybe. Ends up miscuing it, driving it on the bounce to long-on instead"

18.1,"Laughlin to Rana, 2 runs","full on middle stump, makes room to drive to the right of long-off. KKR have picked up a million twos today"

17.5,"Stokes to Rana, no run",goes wide of the crease and angles a bouncer into the stumps. Carries at shoulder height to Buttler after Rana makes room and fails to connect with his uppercut
17.4,"Stokes to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face and dabs gently towards short third man"
17.3,"Stokes to Karthik, FOUR runs","and he sends down a stump-high full-toss outside off stump. A misdirected yorker. Karthik carves it away square, a long way to the left of the only man on the off-side boundary"
17.2,"Stokes to Karthik, 2 runs","back of a length, angling into the body, whipped away to the left of deep backward square leg"
17.1,"Stokes to Rana, 1 run","short, angling into off stump. Rana moves across to play a short-arm jab out to deep square leg"
16.6,"Unadkat to Rana, 1 run","slower ball on middle and off, fairly full. Lets it come and opens his bat face to steer to deep point"
16.5,"Unadkat to Rana, SIX runs","shot. Unadkat looks for the off-stump yorker this time and doesn't miss his length by much. But Rana takes a big step back into his crease to create some swinging room, and simply lifts it over mid-off"
16.4,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length, angled across to off stump, punched to deep point"
16.3,"Unadkat to Karthik, SIX runs","short on middle and leg, and Karthik steps across and pulls it over the backward square leg boundary - picks out the short boundary on that side, and clears it despite only managing a 64m hit. Didn't look to hit it too hard, just helped it and found the gap to the right of deep square leg"
16.2,"Unadkat to Rana, 1 run","in the blockhole close to off stump, looks to make room to drive through the covers, ends up squeezing it down to long-on instead, off the inside half of the bat"

15.1,"Laughlin to Karthik, 2 runs","back of a length on off stump, Karthik tucks it smartly into the vacant midwicket area. Laughlin gives chase, with the fielder on the boundary, and they scamper two more. From this end, the leg-side boundary is quite long, so Karthik played the field cleverly"
14.6,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run","another slower one, on middle stump this time, and Karthik steps across to flick. Short fine leg dives left to make a good stop"

14.3,"Unadkat to Rana, no run","length ball on off stump, a bit of nip back in to tuck up Rana. He dabs it gently to the off side of the pitch and takes off looking for the quick single. Unadkat moves quickly in his follow-through, picks up and throws at the batsman's end and misses. Would have been comfortably out if he had hit, despite the desperate dive. Really didn't judge that at all"
14.2,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run","short again, not so much width this time, pulled to deep midwicket"
14.1,"Unadkat to Karthik, 2 runs","shortish, slanting across to off stump, punched to the right of deep point, and he picks up another two"

12.3,"Gowtham to Uthappa, OUT","has Stokes caught that cleanly? The umpires are going to have a look. In Uthappa's slot for the lofted drive, which he hits hard and flat, but Stokes is on the boundary at long-on. He was stepping backwards as he took the catch over his head, about to tumble past the boundary, so he flicked it in the air, then stepped on the rope, and managed to return to the field of play and complete the catch comfortably enough in the end. Perhaps unwise of Uthappa to take on the deep fielder in this situation, but he's played an excellent hand for KKR"
12.2,"Gowtham to Rana, 1 run","angled into the pads again, and this time he sweeps it out to deep backward square leg"
12.1,"Gowtham to Rana, FOUR runs","flat length ball angling into the pads, and Rana tucks it away neatly, nice and fine and the man at deep backward square leg is too far from the ball to even be in the frame"
11.6,"Laughlin to Rana, 1 run","yorker on middle and off, shuffles across to clip to deep square leg"
11.5,"Laughlin to Uthappa, 1 run","low full-toss outside off, a bit of outswing on that, flicked deliberately in the air, without too much weight on the stroke, so it drops well short of deep midwicket"
11.4,"Laughlin to Uthappa, no run","slower ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
11.3,"Laughlin to Rana, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, punched towards extra-cover, and then takes off for the quick single. Rahane moved quickly to the ball, but he took a touch too long to turn and aim at the bowler's end, and Rana would have made it home even if he had hit the stumps"
11.2,"Laughlin to Rana, no run","slower length ball on off stump, presses forward and defends studiously"
11.1,"Laughlin to Rana, FOUR runs","low full-toss close to off stump, and that's beautifully timed by Rana. Just opens his face slightly and sends it racing away to the left of the man sprinting from deep point"
10.6,"Gowtham to Uthappa, no run","appeal for stumping here. Fired in quick outside off, and Uthappa misses the sweep having stretched out quite far. He lifted his foot momentarily, but grounded it well in time"
10.5,"Gowtham to Uthappa, no run","ooh, good ball. Flat length ball and Uthappa jabs at it in front of his body, nearly pops back a return catch. Doesn't carry, though"
10.4,"Gowtham to Rana, 1 run","fullish on middle stump, gets forward to clip it away through square leg"
10.3,"Gowtham to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, whipped to long-on"
10.2,"Gowtham to Uthappa, no run","goes on the back foot to punch it, but it keeps low and he jabs it back to the bowler instead"
10.1,"Gowtham to Rana, 1 run","Another misfield. Down the track and he bowls it quick and angling into the batsman. Drives it back towards him, and he lets it slip through his fingers and roll towards long-off"
9.6,"Stokes to Rana, 1 run","short, a bit of width, but there's a man at deep point to stop Rana's cut"
9.5,"Stokes to Uthappa, 1 run","full on leg stump, clipped to long-on"
9.5,"Stokes to Uthappa, 1 wide","oh my god. Is that the widest leg-side wide in the history of the universe? Thankfully for the keeper, it was a slower ball gone wrong, and it gave him plenty of time to move to his left and stop it running away for more runs"
9.4,"Stokes to Rana, 1 run","in the blockhole on off and middle, clipped down to long-on"
9.3,"Stokes to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball on the stumps, clipped away through midwicket"
9.2,"Stokes to Uthappa, FOUR runs","oh no, poor fielding on the rope from Unadkat. Length ball attacking the top of off stump and Uthappa slaps it in the air, on the bounce, towards deep point. Unadkat falls to his right to try and stop it, and doesn't cover for the ball spinning away from him - should have known because Uthappa sliced it"
9.1,"Stokes to Rana, 1 run","back of a length, angling into off stump, waits on it and stabs firmly towards backward point, who makes a diving stop but lets the ball roll away to allow the single"
8.6,"Gopal to Uthappa, SIX runs","tossed up on middle stump, and it's right in Uthappa's arc as he stretches out and slog-sweeps it waaay over cow corner"
8.5,"Gopal to Rana, 1 run","back of a length, wrong'un, turning towards off stump. Goes on the back foot to work it through forward square leg"
8.4,"Gopal to Narine, OUT","run-out ends the partnership! Another skiddy slider. Narine misses the reverse-sweep, gets hit on the pad, and he ambles out of his crease looking for a leg-bye as the ball rolls towards short third man and Buttler goes up in appeal for lbw. He realises too late that the single isn't on, and by the time he turns around the throw from Jaydev Unadkat is nearly in Buttler's gloves"
8.3,"Gopal to Narine, no run","down the track and Shreyas bowls it slightly shorter, a slider going across him towards off stump. Pushed gently to mid-off"
8.2,"Gopal to Uthappa, 1 run","flatter length ball close to off stump, presses forward, opens his bat face, and dabs to short third man"
8.1,"Gopal to Narine, 1 leg bye","slow legbreak on leg stump. Looks to stretch out and flick, misses it, and it rolls off his pad into the square leg region"
7.6,"Stokes to Uthappa, no run",beaten as he looks to steer this behind point. Bounce nearly did him in.
7.5,"Stokes to Uthappa, no run","late on the stroke, looked to angle this behind point. Length was too full. Beaten"
7.4,"Stokes to Narine, 1 run","full outside off, dug out to beat a diving Rahane at cover"
7.3,"Stokes to Narine, FOUR runs","looks to back away and slap this over cover, but gets a thick outside edge past the keeper, no chance for third man. More frustration for the Royals"
7.2,"Stokes to Uthappa, 1 run",squeezes this flick towards deep midwicket
7.1,"Stokes to Uthappa, no run",beaten for pace. 146kph. This length ball angles back in to hit him on the back thigh as he tries to work this to the leg side.
6.6,"Gopal to Narine, 2 runs","floats this wide, in the swinging arc, Narine lofts this over cover. Stokes with a sliding stop at wide long-off"
6.5,"Gopal to Narine, no run","spins away from length on middle, defended back"
6.4,"Gopal to Uthappa, 1 run",worked with the spin towards deep midwicket. This was a googly
6.3,"Gopal to Uthappa, SIX runs","half-tracker that Uthappa pulls way over the deep midwicket fence. Too easy, pie that was asking to be hit"
6.2,"Gopal to Uthappa, no run",goes back into the crease and defends this length ball
6.1,"Gopal to Uthappa, no run","touch short, this spins away sharply from outside off though, bunted to the off side"
5.6,"Laughlin to Narine, SIX runs",follows an outstanding yorker with a half-tracker. Narine uses the depth of the crease to muscle this pull over deep midwicket.
5.5,"Laughlin to Narine, no run","backs away to go over cover but the bowler does well to bowl this full and straight towards his toe, squeezed to the leg side"
5.4,"Laughlin to Uthappa, 1 run","floats this full outside off, defended wide of mid-off as they scamper a quick single"
5.3,"Laughlin to Narine, 1 run",gets on top of the bounce and tucks this towards square leg
5.2,"Laughlin to Uthappa, 1 run",punches this length ball down to long on
5.1,"Laughlin to Uthappa, FOUR runs","short and angling down, Uthappa helps this down to beat short fine leg. Too easy. Not an ideal start from Laughlin"
4.6,"Unadkat to Uthappa, 1 run","sumptuous straight drive, but this is an outstanding stop by Laughlin at mid-off. Ran quickly towards his right and then put out a full-length dive to cut that off"
4.5,"Unadkat to Uthappa, FOUR runs",deliberately done! Very clever from Uthappa. Opens the bat face at the last moment to use the pace and angle to tickle this past the keeper to the third man boundary.
4.4,"Unadkat to Uthappa, FOUR runs",belted back over the bowler's head. Length ball and Uthappa slapped this away with disdain. That raced to the fence even before Unadkat could turn back on his followthrough
4.3,"Unadkat to Uthappa, no run",looks to run this down but is beaten by the away-going length ball
4.2,"Unadkat to Uthappa, FOUR runs","imperiously pulled, one bounce to the midwicket boundary. Slower delivery, the off-cutter but too short. Uthappa had enough time in the world to line himself for that before giving it a proper whack"
4.1,"Unadkat to Uthappa, no run","oh, and guess what? It's not a cutter! Length ball angling away, defended back."
3.6,"Kulkarni to Narine, no run",superb yorker-length delivery that beats Narine for pace as he looks to squeeze this behind point
3.5,"Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR runs","slower length ball on middle and leg, this time Narine cleverly waited for the ball to arrive before unfurling a flat-batted pull to the midwicket fence. Dhawal assumed he'd look to cut again and bowled it closer to the stumps. Didn't matter."
3.4,"Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR runs","cracked! There's cover and cover point but each one only saw the other's face. No one moved. Length ball, Narine cleared his front leg and walloped that through the line"
3.3,"Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR runs","slower delivery but the length is too short, Narine backs away and slaps this one bounce to the point boundary. Held his shape nicely"
3.2,"Kulkarni to Narine, no run","cracked away but can't pierce the off side ring, hit straight to cover point"
3.1,"Kulkarni to Narine, no run","looks to carve this behind point, but is beaten. Too full again from Dhawal"
2.6,"Gowtham to Narine, 1 run",steps out and works this indrifter down to deep midwicket
2.5,"Gowtham to Narine, no run",makes a bit of room and punches this length ball straight to cover point.
2.4,"Gowtham to Narine, no run","hint of width again, punches this straight to the edge of the ring at cover"
2.3,"Gowtham to Uthappa, 1 run","not quite timed well enough, mistimes this attempted pull on the bounce to Stokes at long on"
2.2,"Gowtham to Uthappa, no run","drops short again, this time he punches this straight to cover"
2.1,"Gowtham to Uthappa, FOUR runs","drops short and Uthappa dispatches that. Rocked back, opened up the off side and cut this through wide mid-off. Solid power"
1.6,"Kulkarni to Uthappa, 1 run",works this length ball towards midwicket. Planted his front leg across a long way as he played that
1.5,"Kulkarni to Narine, 1 run","slower length ball on middle, punched to mid-off for an easy single"
1.4,"Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR runs","thick outside edge as he attempts to slash over point, but this one flies over Buttler's outstretched hands behind the stumps. Streaky boundary"
1.3,"Kulkarni to Narine, no run","looks to slap this over point, toe-ends it to cover instead"
1.2,"Kulkarni to Narine, 2 runs","just chips this over extra cover. Narine wasn't to the pitch of the ball but looked to hit through the line. The ball stopped on him just a touch. Narine turned blindly for the third, but saw Uthappa put his hand out in the nick of time."
1.1,"Kulkarni to Narine, no run","starts off with a full delivery outside off, Narine looks to squeeze this behind point but is beaten"
0.6,"Gowtham to Uthappa, no run",goes back into the crease and steers this shortish delivery to point. Top first over from KG
0.5,"Gowtham to Uthappa, no run",punches this straight to mid-off
0.4,"Gowtham to Uthappa, no run","slides back in to hit him on the thigh pad, Uthappa was looking to whip this off his hip"
0.3,"Gowtham to Lynn, OUT",tries to cut but this spins back in sharply from length to cramp him for room and sees the off and leg  stump flattened. The skid has done the trick.
0.2,"Gowtham to Lynn, no run","flatter length ball on middle, defended back"
0.1,"Gowtham to Narine, 1 run","drifts in from wide of the crease, Narine lunges forward to defend, get a thick inside edge past midwicket"
19.6,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, no run","slower ball, full and wide outside off, and Buttler swings and misses, looking for the long-off boundary. Looked tight, but the umpire decides not to signal wide. Good last over from Mavi, stuck to his plan despite bowling all those wides, and found his rhythm in the end"
19.5,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 1 run, OUT","slants it away from Buttler's off stump again - not a yorker this time but quite full again. Flat-batted down to long-off and they chance the second just to keep Buttler on strike. Mavi fails to collect the throw cleanly, but he still collects it in time to catch Kulkarni short of his crease"
19.4,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 2 runs",gets the wide yorker right this time. Buttler reaches out and slaps it to deep point. Just about manages to turn around and hurry back for a second
19.4,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 1 wide",oh no. Another wide full one - a slower one too - and it ends up waaaaay wide of off stump
19.3,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, no run","bangs it in short now, and gets the angle right on this occasion. Within reach of Buttler to play a shot, but perhaps not the pull he was looking for. Plays and misses"
19.3,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 1 wide","and again. A misdirected wide yorker from round the wicket, ends up bowling it too wide. Karthik had been gesturing to him to bowl a wide yorker, with his right arm extended outwards"
19.3,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 1 wide","looks for the wide yorker, and from that round-the-wicket angle, there's a big danger of slanting it too wide. That's what he ends up doing. Buttler doesn't even try to go after it"
19.2,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 2 runs","shortish, slanting away into a fifth-stump line, pulls it along the ground to the left of deep midwicket, and they hurry through for two"
19.1,"Shivam Mavi to Kulkarni, 1 run","full outside off, Kulkarni had made himself room and threw his hands at the ball, ended up slicing it chest-high to Lynn at backward point, and he drops it. Allows Buttler to come on strike too"
18.6,"Tom Curran to Buttler, FOUR runs","low full-toss outside off, and that brings Buttler's incredible bottom wrist into play. A table-tennis-style whip enables him to pick up a flat one-bounce four to the left of long-on"
18.5,"Tom Curran to Buttler, 2 runs","wide slower one, fairly full. I think Buttler was looking to stab that through point, but ended up playing too early and ended up flat-batting it to long-off instead"
18.4,"Tom Curran to Kulkarni, 1 run","low full-toss angling into middle and leg, cramps him for room and all he can do is stay leg-side of the ball and jab to the left of cover"
18.4,"Tom Curran to Buttler, (no ball) 1 run","full on middle and off, jabbed down to long-off, and guess what, Curran's overstepped. But Kulkarni will be on strike for the free hit."
18.3,"Tom Curran to Kulkarni, 1 run","back of a length outside off, this is a better ball to play that late dab against, and Kulkarni gets off the mark with a single to third man"
18.2,"Tom Curran to Gopal, OUT","bowled him! Curran follows the slower one with a fast length ball, angling into off stump. Shreyas' feet are stuck, going neither forward nor back, and he plays with half a bat, opening the face to try and dab it fine. He misses, and Curran knocks out his off stump"
18.1,"Tom Curran to Gowtham, OUT","slower ball, full outside off, and Gowtham departs. Looks to hit it over cover, maybe, ends up slicing a simple catch to backward point"
17.6,"Narine to Buttler, FOUR runs","drops it short now and Buttler punishes him, makes a bit of room to flat-bat this extremely hard, into the gap to the left of long-off"
17.5,"Narine to Gowtham, 3 runs","big offbreak now, looks to hoick into the leg side and gets an inside edge down into the fine leg region"
17.4,"Narine to Gowtham, no run","dangled up slow outside off, turns away from Gowtham again. Slogs across the line and fails to connect"
17.3,"Narine to Gowtham, SIX runs","some release for Royals, finally. Down the track, not quite to the pitch of Narine's carrom ball. Goes through with the straight loft nonetheless, and slices it a little, but that helps get it wider of long-off, Gill, who dives left at the rope, gets his hands to it, but can't hold on or flick it back into the field of play"
17.2,"Narine to Buttler, 1 run","shortish on off stump, chopped away through point"
17.1,"Narine to Buttler, no run","fired in full at the pads. Probably knew he wanted to try and make room. Tries to flick, can't connect, the ball hits his pad instead"
16.6,"Chawla to Buttler, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
16.5,"Chawla to Gowtham, 1 run","mishit. Wanted to drive this flighted off-stump ball through the covers, was a touch early on it and ended up dragging it out to deep midwicket"
16.4,"Chawla to Gowtham, 2 runs","tossed up fuller now, outside off, driven to long-off"
16.3,"Chawla to Gowtham, no run","not short enough to cut, chops it straight to backward point"
16.2,"Chawla to Buttler, 1 run","back of a length, punched to sweeper cover"
16.1,"Chawla to Stokes, OUT","Another dismissal against wristspin for Stokes. Excellent bowling from Chawla, saw Stokes coming early and tossed it wider and slower. He ended up too much under the ball and not enough behind it, and it was the googly too, spinning away from him and causing him to skew his attempted slog over mid-on to the man at cover, who moved backwards and to his left to get under the skier"
15.6,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run","flatter and fuller on middle stump, pushed down to long-off"
15.5,"Kuldeep to Stokes, SIX runs","bang, Stokes is away. Tossed up on off stump, right in his arc, and even though he's hitting against the turn, and the ball has a certain distance to turn before it hits his bat, he still swings cleanly and clears long-on"
15.4,"Kuldeep to Buttler, 1 run","googly, but it's also a long-hop, but it doesn't get the punishment it probably deserves because there's a man back at deep forward square leg to keep it down to one"
15.3,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, punched to long-off"
15.2,"Kuldeep to Buttler, 1 run","back of a length, slightly quicker. Another wrong'un hurrying on towards middle stump, punched to long-off"
15.1,"Kuldeep to Buttler, no run","wrong'un, pitching outside leg. Buttler picks it and reverse-sweeps, but straight to backward point"
14.6,"Narine to Stokes, 2 runs","shortish on off stump, flat-batted to the left of long-on and they sprint another couple"
14.5,"Narine to Buttler, 1 run","full now, on middle and off, jabbed to long-off"
14.4,"Narine to Buttler, 2 runs","offbreak turning towards middle stump, clipped gently to the left of deep midwicket. He has to come in a fair distance off the rope, and they use that time to sprint two"
14.3,"Narine to Stokes, 1 run","down the track again, this time gets closer to the ball to drive to long-on"
14.2,"Narine to Stokes, no run",looks to step out but Narine holds his length back slightly while hurrying him with his pace. Can only defend it back towards the bowler
14.1,"Narine to Stokes, no run","flat offbreak turning towards off stump, jabbed to midwicket"
13.6,"Kuldeep to Tripathi, OUT","taken! Andre Russell, at short extra-cover, jumps and is at full stretch to grab this overhead chance two-handed, after Tripathi skips inside the line to try and loft this flighted wrong'un, pitching on leg stump, over the fielder"
13.5,"Kuldeep to Tripathi, no run","flatter and fuller on middle and leg, pushed into the vacant midwicket region but Kuldeep sprints across to save the single"
13.4,"Kuldeep to Tripathi, FOUR runs","short again, on off stump, and that's brilliantly done, super quick feet to jump right back and then swivel through the hips to pull into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
13.3,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run","back of a length skidder, going with the angle towards off stump, punched down to long-on"
13.2,"Kuldeep to Tripathi, 1 run","short ball, and Tripathi's eyes must have lit up for a second, because it looked eminently pullable, but it kept low. Kept his eyes on it and shovelled it down to long-on instead"
13.1,"Kuldeep to Stokes, 1 run","tossed up on middle stump, driven quietly down to long-off for one"
12.6,"Rana to Stokes, 1 run",works this off a thick inside edge to Curran at deep midwicket
12.5,"Rana to Short, OUT",he's done him with a slider again. There's some drift back in. Short goes back to pull but is beaten by this 90kph delivery that goes straight on to beat his attempted whip and crash into the stumps.
12.4,"Rana to Short, no run","slides back in and skids on, Short shapes to cut but ends up hitting it off the inside edge back to the bowler"
12.3,"Rana to Tripathi, 1 run",whips this down to deep midwicket as they jog the single
12.2,"Rana to Short, 1 run",forces this length ball from the crease to deep cover again
12.1,"Rana to Tripathi, 1 run",driven towards Chawla at sweeper cover
11.6,"Shivam Mavi to Short, 2 runs","slaps this short of length delivery, Kuldeep at wide mid-off does well to pull off a sliding stop."
11.5,"Shivam Mavi to Short, FOUR runs","pure timing, pure pace. There's width on this short delivery, Short stays back inside the crease and then steers this behind point."
11.4,"Shivam Mavi to Short, SIX runs"," deep into the stands at deep square!  Backed away to slash but saw the bowler dish in a short ball on middle and leg, Short picked the length, swiveled back and hammered this. The bat speed was tremendous!"
11.3,"Shivam Mavi to Tripathi, 1 run",glorious drive on the up but straight to sweeper cover
11.2,"Shivam Mavi to Short, 1 run","works this behind square, towards Shubman Gill at dreep square leg"
11.1,"Shivam Mavi to Short, no run",slaps this away-going length ball back to the bowler
10.6,"Narine to Tripathi, FOUR runs",tripe! Punished as Tripathi swivels back and slaps this to bisect long on and deep midwicket. Half-trackers too eas
10.5,"Narine to Short, 1 run",works this full delivery on the pads to Curran at deep midwicket
10.4,"Narine to Short, no run",gets a good stride in as he defends to short cover
10.3,"Narine to Short, no run","defended back to the bowler, played this after it spun away."
10.2,"Narine to Short, FOUR runs",too short and he's walloped this one bounce to the deep square leg boundary. Picked the length early. Key to the timing was he didn't look to smack this. All timing.
10.1,"Narine to Tripathi, 1 run",driven down to wide long off
9.6,"Tom Curran to Short, FOUR runs","this is a lovely whip. Too short on middle and leg, uses his wrists to play this behind square and beat deep square leg. The best shot Short has played this season!"
9.5,"Tom Curran to Short, 2 runs","pulled away but not entirely in control, Kuldeep comes around to cut that off at deep backward square leg."
9.4,"Tom Curran to Tripathi, 1 run","squared up by the length, but Tripathi readjusts as he angles this down to third man"
9.3,"Tom Curran to Short, 1 run","whips this full delivery to deep midwicket. Another mix-up, Tripathi had to dive full stretch to get back after Short said no quite late for the second. Correct call in the end, there was no second run there."
9.2,"Tom Curran to Short, no run",defends this full delivery from the crease to midwicket
9.1,"Tom Curran to Tripathi, 1 run","slants in a full delivery on the stumps from wide of the crease, eased down to long on"
8.6,"Shivam Mavi to Short, no run",once again late on the forward defence. Gets a thick inside edge as he pushes outside the line of this delivery.
8.5,"Shivam Mavi to Short, no run",Short was having a stroll like he'd do along the Yarra river back home. Saved because there's no direct hit at the striker's end from short midwicket. Just defended the ball and was casually wandering around the crease.
8.4,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, OUT","he's played the short-arm jab straight to Kuldeep at deep midwicket. Samson was cramped for room, hustled for pace as this angled back in to hit him high on the bat. Impressive effort delivery, the young man is elated. The dangerous Samson is gone."
8.3,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, FOUR runs","ah, lovely. Square third man was no more than 10 yards away from the ball but couldn't get around. Just a hint of width, Samson opens the bat face to steer this behind point. Lovely timing."
8.2,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, no run","skiddy back of length ball on off from wide of the crease, Samson punches back. Good one-handed stop by Mavi on his followthrough"
8.1,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, no run",late on the stroke. Looked to use the pace and steer this behind point but is beaten.
7.6,"Kuldeep to Short, no run",gets a good stride and smothers this.
7.5,"Kuldeep to Samson, 1 run","too full on the stumps, worked to long on"
7.4,"Kuldeep to Samson, no run",has he got him? Foxed him with this googly. Samson played for the one that spins back in and was struck on the back pad. May have pitched outside leg.
7.3,"Kuldeep to Short, 1 run","the wrong'un this time, the length just a touch short, punched to long on"
7.2,"Kuldeep to Short, no run","shapes to cut but this skids through to cramp him for room, chopped into the off side."
7.1,"Kuldeep to Samson, 1 run",worked with the spin wide of midwicket
6.6,"Rana to Samson, 1 run","flatter and fuller on the stumps, eased to long on"
6.5,"Rana to Rahane, OUT","some DK brilliance there to convert that into a wicket. Magnificent back-handed flick onto the stumps off his right hand. Smart bowling from Rana too. Saw Rahane step out, so he shortened his length and fired this in, Rahane looks to turn this to the leg side but ends up getting little bat on it. Karthik moves swiftly to his left, picks the ball up and flicks it back. I suspect Rahane took it easy and was done in by DK's speed. Stunning work."
6.4,"Rana to Short, 1 run",goes back and across as he punches this down to long on
6.3,"Rana to Short, no run","shapes to play a full-blooded drive but is drawn well forward, still can't get to the pitch of the ball. Gets a thick inside edge onto the ground. Was very close to the boot even as Karthik took the catch and asked for the umpires to check upstairs. The soft signal was not-out. Replays confirm the ball clearly hit the pad-boot and bounced before Karthik grabbed that. Straightforward decision for the TV umpire."
6.2,"Rana to Short, FOUR runs","drifts in a shortish delivery into middle and leg, and Short tickles this past short fine leg. Easy pickings."
6.1,"Rana to Rahane, 1 run","too full on off, eased down to long on"
5.6,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run","googly, shortish and turning in towards off stump, waits on it and dabs to short third man for one"
5.5,"Chawla to Short, 1 run","floated up slow and overpitched outside off, driven down the ground nicely, but long-off is in place to keep it down to one"
5.4,"Chawla to Short, no run","back of a length on off stump, stabbed to cover"
5.3,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run","a bit straighter now, the line, and he clips it down to long-on"
5.2,"Chawla to Rahane, FOUR runs","tossed up wide of off, overpitched, and Rahane doesn't need to manufacture anything to put this away to the boundary. Just a nice stride forward and leans his weight into a drive to beat extra-cover to his right"
5.1,"Chawla to Short, 1 run","tossed up, across the left-hander and drops onto off stump. Clipped to deep midwicket"
4.6,"Shivam Mavi to Short, 1 run","back of a length, skiddy pace undoes Short's attempt to flick it off his legs. Hits him on the thigh pad and drops down by his feet, and Rahane calls early and is out of the blocks in a flash to steal a leg bye. Or did he get an inside edge on it?"
4.5,"Shivam Mavi to Short, FOUR runs","in the slot, and Short finally hits one out of the middle. Slower ball, nice and full, just outside off. Just extends his arms through it to clear mid-off"
4.4,"Shivam Mavi to Rahane, 1 run","short now, and it skids on with pretty decent bounce to cramp Rahane who was looking to cut. Chops it down late into the backward point region"
4.3,"Shivam Mavi to Rahane, SIX runs","Rahane keeps playing his shots. He's probably read (and been angered by) our article questioning his place in the side. Down the track, and a shortish length on off stump ends up as a length he can lift over the bowler's head, to mid-off's right"
4.2,"Shivam Mavi to Short, 1 run","back of a length again, on middle stump, whip-pulled to deep square leg"
4.1,"Shivam Mavi to Short, no run","back of a length close to off stump, angling across the left-hander, whipped to mid-on with a turn of his wrists"
3.6,"Narine to Short, 1 run","flat and quick length ball on middle and off, and he goes on the back foot to clip towards mid-on"
3.5,"Narine to Rahane, 1 run",a bit of flight now and he skips out to clip this to long-on
3.4,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR runs","four in a row. Almost a replay of the previous ball. Drags it down short on off stump, and he skips away to make room and cut it away into that gap between backward point and cover point"
3.3,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR runs","this one's just a bad ball. Short, outside off, and he slaps it away between backward point and cover point"
3.2,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR runs","bam, two fours in a row. Jumps out of his crease early, slightly premeditated, to reach the pitch of this flat one outside off, and frees his arms to beat mid-off to his right"
3.1,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR runs","slowish length ball on off stump and Rahane gets down low and sweeps hard and fine, beats short fine leg to his left"
2.6,"Chawla to Short, no run","another googly, outside off, another attempted cut, another play and miss. Watching this, a lot of teams are going to throw their wristspinners at Short."
2.5,"Chawla to Short, no run","back of a length legbreak, turns into his pads, clipped to square leg"
2.4,"Chawla to Short, no run","another googly. Back of a length outside off, goes back to cut and the ball beats his outside edge"
2.3,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run","down the track and Chawla dangles it up wider and slower. Has to wait for it to land, brings his bottom hand into play to drag it down to long-on"
2.2,"Chawla to Rahane, no run","tossed up outside off, Rahane goes for the reverse-sweep and misses"
2.1,"Chawla to Short, 1 run",so many wrong'uns already. This is a length ball turning towards Short's off stump. Goes on the back foot to push gently into the midwicket region - the bowler has to chase with the fielder back on the boundary
1.6,"Kuldeep to Short, 1 leg bye","slower now, another wrong'un. Turning down the leg side, but he doesn't pick it and the ball turns past his inside edge and hits pad as he looks to flick. Rolls away to short fine leg again"
1.5,"Kuldeep to Short, no run","back of a length, slides on straight just outside off. Goes back and punches to extra-cover"
1.4,"Kuldeep to Rahane, 1 run","down the track to a flighted ball outside off, drives hard to mid-off, just far enough to his right to pick up one"
1.3,"Kuldeep to Short, 1 run",another inside-edge onto pad. This time he comes forward for a gentle push into the covers and fails to read the wrong'un again. Rolls away into the short fine leg region
1.2,"Kuldeep to Short, no run","nicely bowled, wrong'un. Pitching on a good length outside off. Short goes hard at it, looking for the big drive down the ground, gets a thick inside edge onto pad"
1.1,"Kuldeep to Rahane, 1 run","flighted ball on off stump, swept along the ground to deep square leg"
0.6,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run","another shortish googly, spins in towards middle and leg. Deep square leg is back on the fence to keep Rahane's whippy pull down to one"
0.5,"Chawla to Rahane, no run","third googly in a row. Starts very wide of off stump and Rahane looks to cut, but the ball spins in, cramps him, and skids through low to sneak under his bat"
0.4,"Chawla to Short, 1 run","another googly, shorter this time. Short has plenty of time to wait on the back foot and punch to long-off"
0.3,"Chawla to Short, no run","lovely. Back of a length, googly, starts by angling across and turns further away from the left-hander. No feet as he looks to punch into the off side, beaten on the outside edge"
0.2,"Chawla to Short, no run","very full on off stump, almost a yorker, jabbed to extra-cover"
0.1,"Chawla to Rahane, 1 run",starts with a full-toss on off stump. Whipped down to long-on to bring Short on strike
19.6,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","good length on leg stump, and Kohli can't flick it towards the leg side. Hits his thigh pad, and he whimpers in pain. Mumbai Indians win by 46 runs."
19.5,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","excellent ball from Bumrah. Extra short on middle stump, and Kohli flat-bats it over the non-striker's head. Through to long on, but says no to the run"
19.4,"Bumrah to Kohli, SIX runs","moves on to 92! Full on off, and Kohli's down on one knee, and smacks this over the non-striker's head. What a shot"
19.3,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","good length on off, and Kohli tries to slap this over the bowler's head. Played down the wrong line, and the delivery's through to Tare"
19.2,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and Kohli's back-foot punch takes a thick outside edge! Flies over backward point for a boundary. Can he get to hundred?"

18.6,"Mustafizur to Kohli, 1 run","good length on leg stump, clipped off his pads to deep backward square. Keeps strike"
18.5,"Mustafizur to Siraj, 1 run","overpitched on off stump, and tapped down the ground to long off"
18.4,"Mustafizur to Siraj, SIX runs","Super Siraj! Short on middle, and he gets his front leg out of the way before swinging through the ball's line. Tonks it over cow corner for half-a-dozen"
18.3,"Mustafizur to Kohli, 1 run","yorker on middle stump, and Virat does well to dig it towards cover. Only a single"
18.2,"Mustafizur to Siraj, 1 run","good length on middle, and Siraj slogs towards the leg side. Mistimed to cow corner"
18.2,"Mustafizur to Kohli, (no ball) 1 run","good length on leg, and that cramps him for room. Flicked off his pads to deep backward square but looks like he's overstepped. Free hit"
18.1,"Mustafizur to Kohli, SIX runs","full on leg stump, and in Kohli's slot. Big wind up, and then swings with the bat's full followthrough. Smacked into the long-on boundary"
17.6,"Bumrah to Yadav, OUT","back of a length outside off, and Umesh tries to heave it over the off side. Slices it eventually, and the ball's in the air once again. Cover takes his time to get under it, and captain cool completes the catch. His hundredth wicket for Mumbai Indians"
17.5,"Bumrah to Kohli, 1 run","short outside off, and that's been defended off the back foot towards cover"
17.4,"Bumrah to Yadav, 1 run","good length on middle stump, tapped off the back foot to mid on"
17.3,"Bumrah to Woakes, OUT","overpitched full outside off, and Woakes sticks his bat out. It takes the toe end of the bat, and then lobs into the air. Straight to short third man and Bumrah finally gets a wicket"
17.2,"Bumrah to Woakes, no run","slower ball, back of a length outside off. Woakes hasn't picked this up at all, and the ball goes under his attempted leg-side slog"
17.1,"Bumrah to Kohli, 1 run","good length outside off, and Kohli muscles this down the ground past Bumrah's left. He's disappointed with that shot"
16.6,"McClenaghan to Kohli, 1 run","low full toss, but wide outside off. Caresses this drive to Krunal at deep extra cover"
16.5,"McClenaghan to Kohli, 2 runs","very short on leg stump, and enough time for Kohli to get in position. Goes deep onto the back foot and thumps this down the ground to wide long on"
16.4,"McClenaghan to Kohli, 2 runs","back of a length on middle, and going across Woakes' body. He flat-bats it to cover for a quick single"
16.3,"McClenaghan to Woakes, 1 run","full on off, and Woakes gives it a wild leg-side heave. Mistimed to deep backward square this time"
16.2,"McClenaghan to Kohli, 1 run","offcutter on leg stump, and Kohli can't flick this away. Hits his pad, and trickles away to the off side. They sneak through for a run"
16.1,"McClenaghan to Kohli, SIX runs","short arm jab over midwicket! Back of a length on leg, and Kohli comes dancing down the wicket. Gets in position early, and then swings through to the leg side"
15.6,"Mustafizur to Woakes, no run","back of a length on middle, but Woakes misses the pull! The ball goes over his bat, and through to Tare"
15.5,"Mustafizur to Woakes, SIX runs","golf swing! Full on middle, and Woakes goes through with the bat's full swing. Comes off the bat's sweet spot, and it soars over the long-on boundary"
15.4,"Mustafizur to Kohli, 1 run",back of a length on leg stump. Kohli stays on the back foot and whips it over midwicket to the man in the deep
15.3,"Mustafizur to Kohli, FOUR runs","classic Kohli! Good length on middle, and Kohli flat-bats it over Fizz's head with ease. Proper swing of the bat, and the shot is too well hit for Pollard to intercept"
15.2,"Mustafizur to Woakes, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and Woakes does well to open his bat's face. Runs it down to third man once again. That's all Woakes is playing tonight"
15.1,"Mustafizur to Kohli, 1 run","full on off stump, and Kohli whips this off his pads to long on"
14.6,"Pandya to Woakes, no run","good length, just outside off. Woakes tries to run it fine past short third man, but can't thread the gap"
14.5,"Pandya to Kohli, 1 run","waist-high full toss on middle stump with Kohli coming down the wicket. The ball slipped from his hand, I suspect, but the no-ball's not given. Kohli's not happy one bit. Just one of those days for the RCB captain"
14.4,"Pandya to Woakes, 1 run",full on off stump. Woakes stays on the back foot and pushes to cover
14.3,"Pandya to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length outside off. Quite short, in fact, and Kohli comfortably punches down the ground to long on. Back to back fifties for Kohli"
14.2,"Pandya to Woakes, 1 run",back of a length outside off. Woakes opens his bat's face and runs it down to third man. Sliding effort from Fizz in the deep saves some runs
14.1,"Pandya to Woakes, no run","short first ball! Tries to pull, but played under the ball. Through to Tare"
13.6,"Markande to Woakes, 1 run","good length on middle stump, worked off his legs to deep midwicket. Another excellent evening for Markande"
13.5,"Markande to Khan, OUT","purple cap for Markande! Full outside off, and spinning further away. Sarfraz came dancing down the wicket and attempts a big slog, but he's nowhere near the ball, and Tare does the rest."
13.4,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run","full outside leg stump again, smothered with the spin and pushed down the ground to long on"
13.3,"Markande to Kohli, 2 runs","overpitched, but outside leg stump. Clipped off his pads to cow corner, and Kohli wants the second. Sarfraz needs to hurry, and the throw from Pollard is good. Markande collects and whips the bails off, but Sarfraz just got back in time. Phew"
13.2,"Markande to Kohli, no run","good length on middle stump, but spins away from the batsman. Punched off the back foot to cover"
13.1,"Markande to Kohli, SIX runs","lands the padding on the full! Excellent shot from Kohli this time. Flighted outside off, and he hits an exquisite inside-out drive over cover. Textbook stuff"
12.6,"Bumrah to Khan, FOUR runs","slower ball, full outside off. Just sticks his bat out and meets it on the volley. Slapped past backward point for a useful boundary. Another time out"
12.5,"Bumrah to Khan, no run","full outside off, and Sarfraz tries to paddle this over fine leg. Except, he plays it down the middle stump's line, while the ball was bowled outside off"
12.4,"Bumrah to Kohli, 1 run","short outside off, and he pulls this along the ground. Falls just short of midwicket and the throw hits Kishan's eyes on the bounce! This looks bad. He's on the ground, whimpering in pain. Hardik Pandya's hands on his head, he was the man who threw the ball. Kishan's still on the floor, and the team management look worried. His right eye looks very swollen. The physio is still working on him and I think he's being taken off. A big lump near his eye as he walks out of the ground. Who will keep now?"
12.3,"Bumrah to Khan, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and all Sarfraz can do is chop it down to backward point. Scampers across for the single"
12.2,"Bumrah to Kohli, 1 run",good length outside off again. Opens his bat's face and taps it to backward point for a single
12.1,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","on the money first ball. Good length on off, and angling into the batsman. Fended off the back foot"

11.5,"Krunal to Khan, no run","beauty first ball to Sarfraz! What shape. Full on off, and turning across Sarfraz's bat as he tries to work it towards the leg side. Through to Kishan"
11.4,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run",waist-high full toss on leg stump. Misses the leg-side whip behind square. Mistimed to square leg
11.3,"Krunal to Sundar, OUT","full outside off, and forces Sundar to reach at it. Tries to smack it over the bowler's head, but off the bat's toe end. In the air for ages, and easily taken by long off"
11.2,"Krunal to Sundar, no run","extra bounce! Good length on off, and takes off after pitching. Sundar tries to cut, but he's nowhere near that shot"
11.1,"Krunal to Sundar, 2 runs","good length on middle stump. Washington stays on the back foot, and works it to deep midwicket for a couple"
10.6,"Markande to Sundar, 1 bye","full outside off, and spins sharply into the left-hander. Tries to cut but too close to his body. The ball goes under his bat, and Kishan can't hold onto it either"
10.5,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run","full on middle stump, and Kohl tries to whip this over midwicket. Takes the leading edge and goes to cover instead. Lucky"
10.4,"Markande to Sundar, 1 run","full on off, and pushed away from his body. Played to point"
10.3,"Markande to Sundar, FOUR runs","full on off, and Washington uses his wrists to lift this over cover. Played inside out, and picked the googly well"

10.1,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run","tossed up on leg stump, and spinning across Kohli. Driven down the ground, off the front foot, to long off. Singles won't cut it now"

9.5,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","full on leg stump, and Kohli drives to long on for a walking single"
9.4,"Krunal to Anderson, OUT","holes out to cow corner first ball! Tossed up on off, and Anderson is already to hit the big shot. Slogs this across the line, but off the bat's toe end. Straight down the fielder's throat. Krunal Pandya is on cloud nine"
9.4,"Krunal to Mandeep, 1 wide, OUT","this time Kishan stumps! Krunal goes wide outside off again, and Mandeep's stranded once more. Kishan collects it well this time, and easily removes Mandeep's stumps. Rohit looks impressed with Kishan's glovework. The batsman came down the ground way too early"
9.3,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","good length on middle stump, no real pace on this delivery, forcing Kohli to create his own. Muscled towards cow corner"
9.2,"Krunal to Mandeep, 1 run","tossed up on leg stump, cramping Mandeep for space. Squeezed down the ground to long off for only a single"
9.1,"Krunal to Mandeep, 2 runs","flat on leg stump, and Mandeep's quick to come down the ground. Muscles this straight-drive past Kohli to long on, but Suryakumar's diving effort in the deep stops the boundary"
8.6,"Markande to Mandeep, 1 run","quicker ball, full on middle and leg. It's the googly too, so cramps Mandeep for room. Does well to flick it to midwicket"
8.5,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length outside off, stays on the back foot and flat-bats it down to long off"
8.4,"Markande to Mandeep, 1 run","good length on middle stump, worked towards the leg side"
8.4,"Markande to Mandeep, 1 wide","Markande's foxed him, but Kishan can't hold on! Overpitched very wide outside off, having seen Mandeep come down the wicket, misses the shot, but the ball pops out of Kishan's hands. Lucky"
8.3,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run","half-tracker on middle stump, but spinning into Kohli. Whipped off his pads to short fine leg"
8.2,"Markande to Kohli, no run","good length on off, and going straight through this time. Punched off the back foot to Markande"
8.1,"Markande to Kohli, no run","full on middle stump, and Kohli tries to drive straight. Takes the bat's outside edge, and goes towards point instead"
7.6,"Krunal to Mandeep, 2 runs","good length on middle stump, and the ball takes some extra bounce after pitching. Gets big on Mandeep, but still manages to work this towards square leg"
7.5,"Krunal to Mandeep, no run","full on leg stump, and that's been swept! Only to Fizz at short fine leg, though"
7.4,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, flicked off his pads to midwicket. Mistimed, but they'll still collect the single"
7.3,"Krunal to Mandeep, 1 run","low full toss on middle, because Mandeep comes charging down the wicket. Whipped off his pads to cow corner"
7.2,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","good length outside off, and grips away from Kohli after pitching. Opens the bat's face and guides it to short third man"
7.1,"Krunal to Mandeep, 1 run","direct hit! Quicker ball, flat on off, and that's been pushed to mid off for a quick run. The throw is flat, and Mandeep, totally outstretched, is on the crease. Does he have any part of the bat over the line? This is too tough to call. Not out."
6.6,"Markande to Mandeep, 1 leg bye","full on leg stump, and Mandeep comes charging down the wicket. Tries to flick it towards the leg side, but takes his pads instead. Mandeep will scamper across for the run nonetheless"
6.5,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run","full outside off, and sharply spins away from him. Driven away from his body to long off once again"
6.4,"Markande to Mandeep, 1 run","not afraid to flight it at all. Tossed up on off, but comfortably driven to long off for a walking single"
6.3,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run","full on off, and turning away from Kohli. Pushed to long off for a walking single"

6.1,"Markande to Kohli, no run","full outside off, and spinning away from him. Defended towards cover"
5.6,"Mustafizur to Kohli, 1 run","full outside leg, and clipped off his pads to deep midwicket. Comfortably played to the man in the deep. Also the time out"
5.5,"Mustafizur to Mandeep, 1 run","full outside leg, and enough time for Mandeep to smother this over square leg. Whipped to the man at deep backward square"
5.4,"Mustafizur to Mandeep, no run","just past the bat's outside edge! Full on off, and angling across Mandeep. Tried to open the bat's face and run it fine, but the ball zipped past his blade and through to Kishan. Could've easily taken the outside edge"
5.3,"Mustafizur to Mandeep, FOUR runs","full on off, and that's beautifully driven past cover! Takes a big stride forward and taps this half-volley with the bat's full followthrough. Excellent shot to the extra-cover boundary"

5.1,"Mustafizur to Kohli, FOUR runs","just past the keeper's right! Yorker just outside off, and Kohli got his bat down to defend. Takes the outside edge, but goes past Kishan's dive. A valiant effort, but Kohli will collect the boundary"

4.5,"McClenaghan to Mandeep, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and Mandeep whips it off his pads to deep midwicket. Gets off the mark first ball"
4.4,"McClenaghan to AB, OUT","holes out to deep midwicket! That's two for the over. Short on middle, and AB pulls it hard. Hit well, but doesn't have the distance nor the elevation. Easy catch for Hardik, who takes a few steps forward, and completes the catch. Somebody stop McClenaghan!"
4.3,"McClenaghan to Kohli, 1 run","rolls his fingers over this one. Good length on leg stump, and angling across Kohli. Tapped towards cover with soft hands"
4.2,"McClenaghan to AB, 1 run","full on middle stump, and driven towards the on side. Beats the diving midwicket fielder, but intercepted by mid on"
4.1,"McClenaghan to de Kock, OUT","Crashes into off stump! McClenaghan removes de Kock for the third time in five games! Good length outside off, but always angling into de Kock. He came charging down the wicket to slap it past cover, but the ball goes under his bat and straight into the top of off stump. McClenaghan's pumped!"
3.6,"Mustafizur to de Kock, 1 run","overpitched on off stump, and he manages to defend it into the ground. The ball bounces off the pitch, and over Fizz's head, to mid off"
3.5,"Mustafizur to de Kock, SIX runs","full on leg, and in de Kock's range once again. Full swing of the bat, and it's come off the blade's sweet spot. Soars over long on!"

3.3,"Mustafizur to Kohli, no run","slower ball, on off stump. Kohli's forced to check his attempted drive, and taps it with soft hands to point instead. Wants the single, but eventually chooses not to. Smart choice"
3.2,"Mustafizur to de Kock, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and rolls his fingers over this delivery. Cut square off the back foot to the man in the deep for a walking single"
3.1,"Mustafizur to de Kock, FOUR runs","full on off, and it's in de Kock's arc! It's a slower ball too, and he simply adjusts for the pace and then lifts it over midwicket. Falls just short of the cow-corner boundary"
2.6,"McClenaghan to Kohli, FOUR runs","full outside off, and Kohli leans into the drive in a flash. Full followthrough of the bat, and creams it to the extra cover boundary. Can watch that shot all day long"
2.5,"McClenaghan to de Kock, 1 run","full and wide outside off again, and this time de Kock slaps it behind square to deep point. They walk across for the single"
2.4,"McClenaghan to de Kock, no run","legcutter, wide outside off. Takes the pace off the delivery and QDK can't connect with the leg-side slap towards midwicket. Through to Kishan on the bounce"
2.3,"McClenaghan to Kohli, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and clipped towards the leg side. Man there at deep midwicket"
2.2,"McClenaghan to Kohli, no run","appeal for caught behind, but not given! What did that touch, the Mumbai players wonder, but they choose not to review.

1.6,"Krunal to Kohli, no run","full on off stump, and Kohli drives down the ground to mid on. Stopped by the fielder there and that's thirteen off the over"
1.5,"Krunal to Kohli, FOUR runs","good length, but wide outside of. Allows Kohli to stand tall and caress this drive past cover. No one in the deep"
1.4,"Krunal to Kohli, no run","good length outside leg, but spins into Kohli's body thereafter. He tries to shoulder his arms, but the ball hits his body instead"

1.1,"Krunal to de Kock, FOUR runs","tossed up on off stump, and QDK sweeps this over square leg. Top edges it, but does enough to take it over the infield. Fine leg's inside the circle, so it's a relatively safe shot"
0.6,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR runs","pays the price with the extra ball! Full on off stump, and Kohli shuffles towards the off side. Gets behind the line of the ball, and plays a glorious straight drive past the non-striker to end the over"
0.5,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","good length, just outside off. Kohli takes a step forward and fends it back to Bumrah"
0.4,"Bumrah to de Kock, 1 leg bye","slower ball, good length on leg stump. Cramps de Kock for space, who misses the whip towards the leg side. Hits his thigh pad"

0.3,"Bumrah to de Kock, no run","full on leg stump, and de Kock misses the leg-side swipe. Hits his front pad, and big appeal from Bumrah, but the ball would've gone down leg stump"

0.1,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","back of a length outside off, gets big on Kohli, as he chops it down to third man"
19.6,"Anderson to Pandya, FOUR runs","drilled down the ground, long-off was no more than five metres away from the ball but he had no chance. What a flourish, what a finish."
19.6,"Anderson to McClenaghan, 2 wide","sees the batsman making room, bowls this full and wide. Umpire calls this wide, but Hardik has the presence of mind to scamper through."
19.5,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, OUT","he's hit this straight to Woakes at long on this time. Rohit won't get the hundred but what an innings he's played. For a while, it looked like he'd hit this well but Rohit knew there wasn't much power."
19.4,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","flat bats this full toss back over the bowler's head, long on comes around but Woakes can't get there. The season's highest individual score"
19.3,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","this has been smacked over deep extra cover. Is that a no-ball? Thought I saw the umpire's right hand go out as he bowled the delivery. Missed his length completely, looking for a wide yorker, and Rohit picked that away. Okay, so this isn't a no-ball."
19.2,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","lofted over the bowler's head, one bounce into the ropes. Clean strike down the ground"

18.5,"Woakes to Pandya, 1 run",drills this drive to sweeper cover
18.4,"Woakes to Pandya, SIX runs","slaps this length ball, just clears long-off. This is back of length outside off, Pandya held his shape and waited for the ball before swinging through cleanly."
18.3,"Woakes to Pandya, SIX runs","belted into the stands! This is a poor ball, tripe ball. This is too short., freebie for Pandya as he mucles this behind square"
18.2,"Woakes to Pandya, no run","beauty first up. Snakes back in from length to kiss the outside edge?  Hardik reviews immediately.  Woakes the only one to appeal for this one.  There's a small little disturbance, can't really call it a spike.  Nothing conclusive, so the decision has been overturned. Kohli has a word with umpire Nitin Menon, more like letting out his frustration."
18.1,"Woakes to Pollard, OUT","has hit this straight to long-on. Dragged this from outside, bat face turned in his hand which meant there was no power and AB took this nicely running around the ropes. Clever from Woakes as well, didn't give Pollard much pace to work with as he rolled his fingers over the ball."
18.1,"Woakes to Pollard, 1 wide","rubbish ball. Full but way outside off, trying to bowl at that wide line to not allow Pollard a swing through the arc"
17.6,"Siraj to Pollard, 1 run",squeezes out this yorker towards square leg.
17.5,"Siraj to Pollard, no run","excellent yorker, towards the base of middle, dug out."
17.4,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full but veering in from wide of the crease, Rohit is off balance as he looks to ramp this towards short fine. There's an appeal, but Rohit got some bat on it."
17.3,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","this is sitting up nicely for Rohit to belt this out of the ground at wide long-on. Third tier. Massive, massive hit. He just hasn't learnt. Keeps bowling length and keeps getting punished."
17.2,"Siraj to Pollard, 1 run","full and straight on off stump, drilled to long on"
17.1,"Siraj to Pollard, 2 runs","skiddy length ball on middle and leg, whipped towards deep midwicket"
16.6,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","low full toss on the pads, flicked towards deep midwicket where Chahal and Woakes come up with a tag-team effort"
16.5,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","steps out and slaps this length ball to Chahal at the edge of the ring at extra cover, he got some hand on the dive to take pace off. Siraj mops it up in the deep"
16.5,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","slower ball at length but way outside off. Lost control on release, left alone. Wide"
16.4,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, no run",reaches out to squeeze this full delivery to backward point. Saw Rohit backing away and bowled this wide. Nice from Umesh
16.3,"Yadav to Pollard, 1 run",thick outside edge to third man as he looks to slice this towards point
16.2,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","right into the blockhole, squeezed back past Umesh"
16.1,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","has that been picked up at the Marine Lines station? Full toss on his hips from wide of the crease, Rohit simply lends direction to this and deposits this deep into the stands at fine leg."
15.6,"Anderson to Pollard, no run",gets right forward and defends this full ball on off stump
15.5,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",chips this down towards long-off
15.4,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","buffet ball. Short, wide outside off and Rohit belted this through point. No chance for square third man. Pretty similar to the first delivery. Very poor from Corey Anderson"
15.3,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run, OUT","steps out and swings this length ball back towards long-on. Anderson put his left hand out but couldn't stop. The throw from Woakes was flat, Anderson collected the ball cleanly and removed the bails. Remains to be seen if the dive saved Krunal. No. He's short by a long way."
15.2,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, no run","right into the blockhole, dug out to the off side, nearly a collision with the bowler at the non-striker's end. Krunal receives some treatment and water. Small break in play."
15.1,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",width and he's hammered this to the point boundary like a - insert your favourite word -  tracer bullet 
14.6,"Yadav to Krunal, FOUR runs","pulled behind square to beat Washington at fine leg. Too much pace to work with, easy pickings."
14.5,"Yadav to Krunal, no run",dug in short but this is just outside leg. Not called though. That's one bouncer for the over.
14.4,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",drills this drive to sweeper cover
14.3,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, no run",flicks this low full toss to midwicket. Looks at the bat immediately
14.2,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","short, wide and he's slashed this to the third man boundary. 32-ball half-century  for the skipper. He's back and how"
14.1,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs",hasn't started well. This has been pulled into the deep square leg boundary with some style and nonchalance. Rohit picked the length early and allowed his timing to do the rest.
13.6,"Chahal to Krunal, no run","just lands short of a diving Kohli at cover. Nicely tossed up wide outside off, Krunal looked to reach out and go over cover but there was no timing on this one."
13.5,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","shortish delivery angling in towards leg stump, whipped towards deep midwicket"
13.4,"Chahal to Krunal, 1 run","goes across again and fetches this slog sweep, on the bounce to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Chahal to Krunal, SIX runs","he's not only picked the googly but also gotten himself right towards the delivery and hoicked it across the line to clear long-on. Chahal specifically drifted this across, Krunal ended up dragging it but he got plenty of wood on that"
13.2,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","touch short, spinning away from outside off, Rohit slaps this to sweeper cover"
13.1,"Chahal to Krunal, 1 run",toe-ends a lofted hit to long-on
12.6,"Siraj to Krunal, 1 run","short, slow and very wide outside off. Forces Krunal to reach at it, but he's through his shot too early. Drags the shot towards mid on, but with no power"
12.5,"Siraj to Krunal, no run","soft appeal for lbw, but turned down. Good length on leg stump, and Krunal can't connect with the leg-side swipe. Takes the top of his pad and the ball trickles away towards cover"
12.5,"Siraj to Krunal, 1 wide","too short! Pitches on middle, and soars over Pandya's head. He didn't even bother playing a shot. Kohli, however, is not pleased, but replays suggest that the umpire got it spot on"
12.4,"Siraj to Krunal, no run","half-tracker on middle stump, but bowls very straight. Krunal rocks back and check-drives back to Siraj. Aggression from the bowler, who takes a aim at Krunal's stumps  but doesn't throw it in the end"
12.3,"Siraj to Krunal, 2 runs","on middle stump, and Krunal muscles this towards the leg side. Mistimes a slog over midwicket to the man in the deep. Not hit well at all"
12.2,"Siraj to Krunal, no run","almost chopped on! Good length on off, and Krunal's cut shot is too close to his body. Takes the toe end of the bat, and goes to the keeper on the bounce"
12.1,"Siraj to Krunal, no run",starts off with the ball that zips through the surface. Good length on off and Krunal's forced to defend off the back foot
11.6,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, no run","miscommunication, but safe! Good length on middle, and Rohit opens his bat's face to run it down to third man. No run on offer, but krunal's halfway down the wicket anyway. Does well to turn and run back"
11.5,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","short on leg stump, and this is cattle fodder for Rohit. Rides the bounce and pulls over the square-leg umpire with ease. No chance for fine leg either"
11.4,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","full on off and driven away from his body. Takes a thick outside edge, and flies over point to third man. Slight misfield from Sarfraz there, but manages to recover quickly enough. Virat ain't pleased though"
11.3,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on off stump, and going across Rohit. Punched off the back foot to cover point"
11.2,"Anderson to Lewis, OUT","top edged, and taken! De Kock gets under it and completes a swirling catch. Tried to flat-bat this over mid on, with the ball angling into Lewis' body, but he's through his shot too early, and comes off the toe end. It was in the air for a long time, and QDK had to run backwards for a while before the ball came back to Earth"
11.1,"Anderson to Lewis, no run","good length on middle stump, attempted pull off the back foot only goes to mid off"
10.6,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on leg stump, and Rohit tries to defend inside out. Pushed past the bowler's left to mid off"
10.5,"Chahal to Lewis, 1 run","good length outside off, and Lewis pokes at it off the back foot. Played to short third man"
10.4,"Chahal to Lewis, SIX runs","second tier! Full on middle, and slog-swept over deep midwicket this time. Once again quick to get down on one knee, and then Lewis' bat speed does the rest"
10.3,"Chahal to Lewis, SIX runs","releases the pressure! Two dot balls, but Lewis ain't wasting the third. Tossed up on off, and Lewis comes down the wicket to lift it over long off. Not even the best of shots, with the bat turning while hitting the shot, but enough power to clear the boundary"
10.2,"Chahal to Lewis, no run","short and wide outside off, and forces Lewis to reach at it. The ball stays low and he misses the cut once again. He's surprised that it's not a wide, but the ball was inside the tram-lines"
10.1,"Chahal to Lewis, no run","full outside off, and zipping straight across Lewis' body. Tries to punch towards cover, but misses competely"
9.6,"Anderson to Lewis, 1 run","good length just outside off and another slower ball to end the over. Opens his bat's face and taps it to point, but Lewis once again wants a risky run. Rohit needs to put in a dive at the batsman's end to be assured of his safety. The ball eventually hits his elbow"
9.5,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full and wide outside off, Rohit sticks his bat out and jams this shot to backward point. He wants a risky single, and Lewis would've been gone if Mandeep had connected with the direct hit!"
9.4,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, no run","slower ball, on a good length. Punched down the ground - past the bowler - to mid on"
9.3,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","lifted over cover this time! This one's much stylish. Slightly fuller on off, and Rohit drives this through the ball's line. Hit over the man at cover, and just beyond mid off too. Races away to the boundary in no time"
9.2,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",slapped past cover! Half-tracker on off and angling across Rohit. He comes dancing down the wicket and hits this through the ball's line. Goes through cover and mid off
9.1,"Anderson to Rohit Sharma, no run","on off stump, and defended off the front foot. Tapped to cover"
8.6,"Chahal to Lewis, no run","good length outside off, and sliding straight through. Tries to cut, but the ball creeps under his bat. Sharply taken by the keeper"
8.5,"Chahal to Lewis, no run",
8.4,"Chahal to Lewis, SIX runs","down on one knee, and sent over midwicket! Tossed up on middle, and Lewis was quick to gauge the ball's length. Slog-sweeps it over the leg side and what a way to get to your first IPL fifty"
8.3,"Chahal to Lewis, no run","wild! Short way outside off, but spins sharply inwards thereafter to eventually finish inside the tram-lines. Lewis left it alone, thinking it'll be a wide, but the umpire disagreed"
8.2,"Chahal to Lewis, 2 runs","good length outside off, and despite the ball staying low, Lewis manages to cut off the back foot to deep point. The throw from the deep is awry, but there was someone backing up"
8.1,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",tossed up full on middle and leg. Rohit comes down the wicket and drives past the non-striker. Almost a caught-and-bowled chance for Chahal first up
7.6,"Sundar to Lewis, FOUR runs","half-tracker, and Lewis swivels to pulls this square! Rocked back onto his backfoot, and slapped this off his pads. Deep midwicket's sliding effort goes in vain. Another expensive Washington over"
7.5,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","turn and bounce! Good length on off and once again spinning into Rohit's body. Cramped for room as he tries to punch to long off, but the extra bounce makes it come off the bat's top half. Played in the air, but eventually safe"
7.4,"Sundar to Lewis, 1 run","full on off, and angling into the left-hander. Driven down the ground off the front foot to long on for a walking single"
7.3,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length on off, and spinning inwards again. Tapped off the back foot to the man at third man. They scamper across for the run"
7.2,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","great use of his feet! Good length on middle, and Rohit comes dancing down the wicket to whip it over midwicket. Into the stands at cow corner"
7.1,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length on off, and turns sharply into Rohit. Extra bounce too, and the batsman defends towards the leg side"
6.6,"Siraj to Lewis, no run","overpitched on off, and Lewis crunches this drive to Kohli at cover. Well stopped by the fielder there and has an aim at the stumps. Good comeback from Siraj. Only three of the over"
6.5,"Siraj to Lewis, no run","short on off, and enough room for Lewis to cut. But he tries to play this with hands that were too hard, and can only bottom-edge it towards the keeper"
6.4,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length outside off, and Rohit punches off the back foot. Hit with the bat's open face, and comfortably played to third man"
6.3,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length on off, but much quicker (142 kph) this time. Rohit shuffles across to the off side and defends with soft hands"
6.2,"Siraj to Lewis, 1 run","short on middle, and angling across Lewis. Tries to muscle this cut behind square, but mistimes it instead. Through to the man in the deep"
6.1,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","goes back of a length, and pitches on off stump. Rohit stands tall and opens his bat's face, and comfortably runs it down fine to third man. Carefully sees the ball onto his bat"
5.6,"Woakes to Lewis, no run","sees the batsman trying to move across and bowls this wide, left alone in anticipation of this being called wide, but this isn't."
5.5,"Woakes to Lewis, no run",can't split the gap at cover. Timed superbly but straight to cover.
5.4,"Woakes to Lewis, no run",stands tall and bunts this short of length delivery to backward point
5.3,"Woakes to Lewis, no run","slower and fuller outside off, hint of drift in, this is dabbed straight to short third man"
5.2,"Woakes to Lewis, no run","beaten off a full toss. Went to blast this through cover, played too early"
5.1,"Woakes to Lewis, FOUR runs","beats short third man. Poor from Siraj. This is full outside off, Lewis uses the pace to run it down. So, so clever."
4.6,"Siraj to Lewis, 1 run","toe-ends a lofted hit to mid-on, they scamper a run even as AB's throw misses the stumps at the bowler's end"
4.5,"Siraj to Lewis, FOUR runs","slower ball outside off, but this nicely comes on as Lewis splits the gap between backward point and short third man. Siraj's bleeding runs already."
4.5,"Siraj to Lewis, 5 wide","slower length ball outside off, left alone but guess what? De Kock has let this through his legs. Four byes. Very poor.  Kohli fumes"
4.4,"Siraj to Lewis, no run","excellent yorker, right towards the base of leg stump, Lewis jammed his bat down quickly to keep that out. A single may have been on, but Rohit lost his balance at the bowler's end"
4.3,"Siraj to Lewis, no run",belted but on the bounce to Kohli at extra cover
4.2,"Siraj to Lewis, no run","floats this full and slants this across, defended from the crease towards cover point"
4.1,"Siraj to Lewis, SIX runs","what a welcome! This is too short and down leg, this is like a scoop of ice cream for Lewis. Swivels back and helps him along the way to clear deep backward square leg."
3.6,"Sundar to Lewis, 1 run"," just in!  Saved by a centimeter or so, I'd say. This was a direct hit at the bowler's end from short third man. Lewis jabbed at this and was late to react to Rohit's call. Somehow made it in the end."
3.5,"Sundar to Lewis, FOUR runs","poor from Washington. Drifts this down leg, Lewis paddles this fine to beat the man at 45. Easy pickings"
3.5,"Sundar to Lewis, 5 wide","fired down leg, Lewis shapes to sweep but misses. de Kock may have been blinded by the drift. Useful runs"
3.4,"Sundar to Lewis, FOUR runs",too much width and he's slashed this to beat point. Used the depth of the crease superbly
3.3,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",gentle little dab towards extra cover for a quick single
3.2,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, no run","skids through from length on off, defended back"
3.1,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","pushed through quicker at length outside off, Rohit punches this between cover and point. Sublime timing"
2.6,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",opens the bat face late to steer this down to third man
2.5,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, no run",stands tall and bunts this length delivery towards cover
2.4,"Yadav to Lewis, 1 run","overpitches, this has bee belted to wide long-off. Siraj was sent to the ropes prior to this delivery precisely for this"
2.3,"Yadav to Lewis, no run","drills this drive, but can't beat mid-off."
2.2,"Yadav to Lewis, FOUR runs","too short down leg, Lewis swivels back and helps this along to beat short fine leg. Easy pickings"
2.1,"Yadav to Lewis, no run",drives this low full toss to mid-off.
1.6,"Woakes to Lewis, 1 run","pushes outside the line, gets a thick inside edge towards fine leg"
1.5,"Woakes to Lewis, SIX runs","pulled and this is into the second tier at deep square leg. Picked the length early, swivelled back and smacked that away."
1.4,"Woakes to Lewis, no run",stays right behind the line of this length ball as he defends
1.3,"Woakes to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","too full, this is driven down but straight to AB at mid-off"
1.2,"Woakes to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","driven imperiously through extra cover. This is a touch ahead of length and Rohit leans forward to ease that between cover and mid-off. Pure timing, pure gold."
1.1,"Woakes to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on off, Rohit drives straight to mid-on"
0.6,"Yadav to Lewis, no run","short of length ball slanting away, Lewis gets on top of the bounce and blocks"
0.5,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","steps out and punches this on the up, but Siraj throws himself to his right to put out a superb stop at mid-off. Saved three runs "
0.4,"Yadav to Lewis, 1 run","shapes back in late, driven to mid-on as they scamper a quick single"
0.3,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye"," hat-trick averted!  This drifted into the pads, Rohit late on the flick, hits the pad and deflects to the off side."
0.2,"Yadav to Ishan, OUT","what is happening here? This is sensational from Umesh. Fast, furious and straight. Right through Kishan's drive. Clean bowled, dream ball. Rohit is scampering to get his pads on and rush out. This is full outside off, the ball curves back in and then beats a loose drive to crash itno the off stump. Stunning from Umesh"
0.1,"Yadav to Yadav, OUT"," goes through his defence!  What a ball first up. This moves holds its line from length on off and beats Surya's loose drive. Golden duck, dream start."
14.2,"Kuldeep to Boult, OUT","chips it back at the bowler. And that's the game for KKR. A googly, lobbed up nicely on middle stump. Boult wants to flick through midwicket but he's done by the turn and finds the bowler"
14.1,"Kuldeep to Nadeem, 1 run",full ball floated wide outside off. Lifts it inside-out to sweeper cover
13.6,"Narine to Boult, no run","length ball outside off, shuffles across and blocks on the front foot. A gorgeous forward block from Boult, as always."
13.5,"Narine to Shami, OUT","taken at midwicket. Length ball at off stump, turning away from him. Steps out as it climbs on him. Looks to go over the leg side but ends up slicing it high into the air"
13.4,"Narine to Nadeem, 1 run","length on middle stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Narine to Shami, 1 run","short of a length outside off, steps out and jabs it through point"
13.2,"Narine to Nadeem, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, nudged past cover off the back foot"
13.1,"Narine to Nadeem, no run",good length on middle stump. Spins into the pads as he looks to flick
12.6,"Kuldeep to Shami, FOUR runs","sails over first slip. A googly, full outside off. Once again, he's looking to go midwicket. It's a top edge"
12.5,"Kuldeep to Shami, no run","googly. Short of a length outside off. Sets up for the slog, adjusts for the cut. Doesn't get bat on it in the end"
12.4,"Kuldeep to Nadeem, 1 run","short googly outside off, under-edge on the cut through cover"
12.3,"Kuldeep to Nadeem, no run","length on off, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
12.2,"Kuldeep to Shami, 1 run","high in the air before it plonks some five yards inside the circle. Too far from long-on. The bowler should have gone for that, really. It's a googly, and he gets a top edge as he looks to clobber it over midwicket"
12.1,"Kuldeep to Nadeem, 1 run","full toss on leg stump, laboured drive to long-on"
11.6,"Narine to Nadeem, 1 run","full floater outside off, guided straight to deep point"
11.5,"Narine to Shankar, OUT","loud appeal for lbw. It's given. Shankar will review this. He's caught on the back foot trying to flick. He's shuffled too. Middle and leg stump visible. This will be plumb if he hasn't got bat on it. Pitching outside off, spinning back in and hitting off stump."
11.4,"Narine to Shami, 1 run",length ball on middle stump. Dabbed through square leg off the back foot
11.3,"Narine to Morris, OUT","bowled him. Narine with a nice loopy offbreak on length, not a harmful delivery. The kind you block with a smile in a Test match. Morris has a mission though, and a steep target. Makes room and tries to go over extra cover. Misses it completely. That's his 100th IPL wicket"
11.2,"Narine to Shankar, 1 run",short of a length and turning away outside off. Nudges to deep midwicket off the back foot
11.1,"Narine to Morris, 1 run","length on middle stump, stays still and taps it to deep midwicket"
10.6,"Kuldeep to Morris, 1 run","tossed up outside off, leans in and drives to long-on"
10.5,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, OUT","short ball, downfall. Another batsman finds the fielder off a half-tracker. It's the pace that's doing it. So slow from Kuldeep, halfway down the pitch. It's a googly but at that length it doesn't matter. Maxwell just has to generate too much power on this occasion. Mis-times and finds deep midwicket"
10.4,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs","huge! Gigantic. What power from Mawell. Length ball pushed through flat at leg stump and he slogs it what must, surely, be at least a 100 metres over the midwicket region"
10.3,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs",Mavi lobs it over the boundary! Oh so close. Kuldeep tosses this right up and Maxwell has to think twice before pulling out the slog. Doesn't get a lot of bat on it. Mavi is behind it at long-on but looks like he's panicked right at the end
10.2,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run","length ball outside off, spins in sharply and beats him as he looks to play the reverse sweep"
10.1,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 2 runs","googly, pushed flat and across off stump. Maxwell gets behind it and thumps it hard to long-on's right. Mavi does superbly to get down and behind that"
9.6,"Tom Curran to Shankar, no run","good length outside off, defends towards point off the front foot"
9.5,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run","legcutter, length and just outside off. Slices on the up towards sweeper cover"
9.4,"Tom Curran to Shankar, 1 run",short of a length and in at leg stump. Gets deep in the crease and nudges it towards fine leg
9.3,"Tom Curran to Tewatia, OUT","straight toe extra cover. The Tewatia experiment ends quickly. It's a length ball outside off and he can get neither power, or elevation as he tries to clear the fielder there. Russell, the man, slightly wrongfooted - moving to his left - but holds on above his right shoulder"
9.2,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run","another slower ball. Short and wide outside off, cut straight to sweeper cover"
9.1,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, SIX runs","that's a woeful ball. Dropped short, a slower ball, on leg stump. Maxwell swivels and sends this flying over the fine leg region with a hoick"
8.6,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run","length ball outside off, looks to drive with no feet. Thick outside edge between backward point and short third"
8.5,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 2 runs",googly outside off. Shuffles right across to get behind it and pull wide of long-on
8.4,"Kuldeep to Tewatia, 1 run",googly. Length and spinnning in from off stump. Tewatia watchful as he taps it through midwicket
8.3,"Kuldeep to Pant, OUT",finds deep midwicket! It's a short ball. Very short. Turning away from off. Pant gets behind and wallops this flat to find Chawla out there. He is not happy getting out like that. Could have hit it wide of the fielder without too much effort. A good innings ends
8.2,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run","googly, short and wide outside off. Cut straight to sweeper cover"
8.1,"Kuldeep to Maxwell, FOUR runs",slow length ball pushed across off stump. Swivels to get in position for the reverse sweep and just manages to get bat on it to get it past short third
7.6,"Tom Curran to Pant, no run",slower short ball. Makes up his mind early to leave this and it loops over him as he adjusts to get out of the way after ducking
7.5,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run","length on off stump, stays in the crease and nudges to long-on"
7.4,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, no run",good length and in at off stump. Tapped to extra cover from the crease
7.3,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, SIX runs",top edge flies fine. It's a short ball angled down leg. He's cramped on the pull but fine leg is in and he makes no effort to try and control this
7.2,"Tom Curran to Pant, 1 run","short of a length outside off, chops it to point's left"
7.1,"Tom Curran to Pant, FOUR runs",overpitched with a lot of room outside off. Pant lives for this. Stays tall and drills it past extra cover
6.6,"Chawla to Pant, 1 leg bye","length ball outside leg, a googly. Looks to sweep but gets it towards short fine off the thigh guard"
6.5,"Chawla to Maxwell, 1 run","short ball outside off, looks to slice it past short third man but Lynn gets down quickly to his right, making extra sure he doesn't land on his problematic shoulder"
6.4,"Chawla to Pant, 1 run","slider, back of a length on middle stump. Drags it to deep square's left with a pull off the inside half"
6.3,"Chawla to Pant, no run",googly at a good length outside off. Leaves it alone and half-apologises to himself
6.2,"Chawla to Pant, FOUR runs",well played. It's a quicker one from Chawla and he's a little late getting back on this. Chops it very very late to get it past backward point
6.1,"Chawla to Pant, SIX runs",full ball floated up with a lot of room outside off. Reaches out and slices it over extra cover to find the boundary
5.6,"Narine to Pant, 1 run",length ball spinning away from off and he does well not to let it go past him. He's beaten in flight as he steps out but manages to tuck it into the midwicket region
5.5,"Narine to Pant, no run","length ball floated up at off stump, defended down the pitch"
5.4,"Narine to Pant, FOUR runs","length ball on middle stump, gets down and sweeps between short fine and square leg"
5.3,"Narine to Pant, FOUR runs","oh good shot. Mid-on is in, strangely. Pant meets this length ball on the pitch outside off and drills it wide of him"
5.2,"Narine to Maxwell, 1 run",short of a length outside off. Gets deep in the crease and wants to punch through midwicket. Gets it to short fine off the inside edge
5.1,"Narine to Pant, 1 run","full on middle stump, gets down and drags a sweep to deep midwicket's left"
4.6,"Shivam Mavi to Maxwell, no run","slower bouncer foxes Maxwell. He wants to leave it, just outside off. But he realises it's a slower one and thinks momentarily about trying to jab it over the keeper. It's too late and he's unhappy:  ""oh nooooooo"""
4.5,"Shivam Mavi to Maxwell, FOUR runs",short and wide outside off. Small step back aaaaaand chop. Through point
4.4,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, 1 run",slower ball. Floated full on leg stump and clipped to deep square leg
4.3,"Shivam Mavi to Maxwell, 1 leg bye",short of a length and in at off stump. Looks to flick but he misses too. Deflected into the off side off the thigh guard
4.2,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, 1 leg bye","length on leg stump, looks to flick but it pings off the thigh guard through the open square leg region"
4.1,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, no run","length ball slanted wide outside off, slashes and misses"
3.6,"Russell to Maxwell, FOUR runs","just clears cover. Maxwell backing away at this short ball, has got this cut off the toe-end. It loops over the infield. Lucky"
3.5,"Russell to Maxwell, no run","good length outside off, tapped straight to mid-off on the up"
3.4,"Russell to Pant, 1 run","length on off stump, taps it in front of cover point and steals a quick single"
3.3,"Russell to Pant, FOUR runs","full outside off, front foot pointed into the leg side and head falling away as he tries to cream this over cover. Get it off the outside half and finds the boundary anyway"
3.3,"Russell to Pant, 1 wide",bouncer lifting sharply just outside leg stump. Late on the hook. Karthik (and me) think there's a sound there. Umpire has his arms spread to signal wide
3.2,"Russell to Pant, FOUR runs","nicely done. Full ball on off stump, drilled straight past the non-striker and there's no stopping that"
3.1,"Russell to Pant, no run",bizzare shot. Length ball on off. He looks to reverse-ramp this. Awfuly position for the shot and he cops it on the back thigh
2.6,"Shivam Mavi to Gambhir, OUT","chops it on! Mavi has Gambhir, Delhi has panic! 144kph hour, short and just outside off, in the corridor. Gambhir leaps off the ground to try and cut, but it's too close and too quick. He's cramped and he's out."
2.5,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, 1 run",bouncer at his front shoulder. Falls away into the leg side awkwardly and gets cramped on the hook. Takes one hand off as well as this rolls into the square leg area
2.4,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, FOUR runs",drops it too short and is punished. Attempted offcutter but there's a lot of time to adjust. Reaches out and steers it wide of short fine
2.3,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, 2 runs","top edge on the pull. He's hurried on that shot. Short one at the hips. Luckily for him, he gets it well in front of square"
2.3,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, 1 wide",bouncer. Too short. Well down leg side. He looks to whip this away but it's too wide
2.2,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, no run","good length just outside off, tapped towards mid-off on the up"
2.1,"Shivam Mavi to Gambhir, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, allows it to come on and whips to fine leg"
1.6,"Russell to Pant, no run","full on middle stump, stays still in the crease and drills this straight to mid-on"
1.6,"Russell to Pant, 1 wide",attempted bouncer. Too far down leg side again. Pant ducks it
1.6,"Russell to Pant, 1 wide",full ball fired down leg side. Lets it go
1.5,"Russell to Iyer, OUT","Rana leaps to his left and holds on. Iyer stuck in a strange position for the late cut. It's a short ball just outside off. It looks like he changes his mind on the late cut very late and wants to just defend it. In the end, hangs the bat out and it's a sharp catch"
1.4,"Russell to Iyer, FOUR runs",short and wide outside off. Sits up perfectly with a lot of width and he slaps it through cover point
1.3,"Russell to Gambhir, 1 run",falls short of fine leg. Hit that better than he expected. Short ball on the hips and he whips it uppishly towards Mavi
1.2,"Russell to Gambhir, FOUR runs","overpitched ball just outside off. Front leg out of the way and carved through cover. No fuss, too simple."
1.1,"Russell to Gambhir, no run","length ball on middle stump, stands tall in the crease and punches straight to mid-off"
0.6,"Chawla to Iyer, no run","googly, spinning in towards middle stump from a good length. Stays in the crease and taps it into the leg side"
0.6,"Chawla to Roy, 1 wide, OUT",leg-side stumping! Roy loses his balance completely. It's a slider down leg side that keeps going away from him as he walks down the pitch for some reason. Has to reach out a long way for the flick and he won't get there. Karthik's toughest task there is gathering the ball. He does that properly and then the stumping is relatively easy
0.5,"Chawla to Roy, no run","slider, short of a length outside off. Looks to cut and under-edges into the pitch"
0.4,"Chawla to Gambhir, 1 run","googly, floated full on middle stump. Gets the front leg out of the way and drives to Russell's left at mid-off"
0.3,"Chawla to Roy, 1 run","slider, full and in at leg stump. Leans in and flicks to deep midiwicket"
0.2,"Chawla to Roy, no run","full ball outside off, plants the front leg out and yorks himself. Looks to flick and gets it into his toe"
0.1,"Chawla to Gambhir, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked straight to deep midwicket"
19.6,"Tewatia to Tom Curran, OUT","and another wicket. What a last over this has been Curran steps down the track and chips this in the air, straight into the hands of long-on"
19.5,"Tewatia to Chawla, OUT","Chawla comes down the track for a big hit. A non-turner again, pretty wide of Chawla, and he was probably expecting it to turn into him, but as he doesn't, he skews it in the air off the outside of the bat and the keeper settles under it"
19.4,"Tewatia to Chawla, no run","really slows it up and gets it to skid across without turn, Chawla swings and misses"
19.3,"Tewatia to Chawla, no run",gets down for a big sweep to a completely wrong length and line. Not full by any means and slanted a long way across
19.2,"Tewatia to Gill, OUT","tame! Very soft dismissal. A bit of room outside off and he flays this with a flat bat, but picks out point. Gill having a tough start to his IPL career"
19.1,"Tewatia to Tom Curran, 1 run","short of a length, spinning in, punched away through the covers"
18.6,"Morris to Gill, 4 leg byes","full toss, he stays really back in the crease and just makes use of the angle to help it along to fine leg"
18.5,"Morris to Tom Curran, 1 run","full and angling in towards off, jabbed too straight down the ground as it crashes into the stumps at the non-striker's end"
18.4,"Morris to Gill, 1 run","full, drifts into the pads, clipped through backward square leg"
18.3,"Morris to Rana, OUT","slower ball, miscues as he tries to loft it over the off side and sends it soaring into the sky. Gambhir settles under it at cover. End of a top innings"
18.2,"Morris to Rana, no run",goes deep in his crease and tries to jab it through point but gets the bottom edge and rolls down the pitch
18.1,"Morris to Rana, FOUR runs","that's amazing: power, wristwork and bat speed. Had everything. Full and wide from Morris and he carts it through backward point as it breezes past the sweeper running to his right at the boundary"
18.1,"Morris to Rana, 1 wide","full, drifts it a long way across, and called a wide"
17.6,"Boult to Rana, 1 run","full, angled into him and dips on him, flicked through square leg"
17.5,"Boult to Rana, FOUR runs","that's a stunning shot. Beautifully done, backs away to a middle-stump yorker and jams the bat down before opening the face to glide it smartly through third man"
17.4,"Boult to Gill, 1 run","fullish around off, drilled extremely hard one-bounce to long-off"
17.3,"Boult to Gill, FOUR runs","oh, shot. Terrific strike from Gill first ball as he pulls it with lots of bottom hand power through midwicket"
17.2,"Boult to Russell, OUT","bowled him! Very good delivery from Boult, almost the perfect delivery to Russell. Fires it in around leg stump and rolls his fingers over it to slow it up. It then dips really late with Russell swinging for the fences, and takes out leg stump"
17.1,"Boult to Rana, 1 run","extremely full, straightish around off, and he gets a leading edge as he closes his face. Fifty for Rana"
16.6,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs","clears long-off off the toe-end! Bouncer just outside off, backs away and looks to go over the leg side. He's cramped and gets it right off the bottom but it clears the fielder easily"
16.5,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs","pumped deep into the stands. Shami feeds the swing outside off with a slower ball on a good length. Russell pummels it 102 metres, far behind deep midwicket"
16.4,"Shami to Rana, 1 run","full ball outside off, gets low and lofts a drive uppishly towards sweeper cover"
16.3,"Shami to Rana, no run","slower ball, back of a length on off stump. Backs away and pushes straight to extra cover"
16.2,"Shami to Russell, 1 run","yorker on off stump, backs away and jams it to long-off"
16.1,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs","carves it over sweeper cover! There's no pace on that. It's a knuckle ball floating away. But he makes room, gets under it on one knee and lifts it cleanly over the fielder there"
15.6,"Morris to Russell, 1 run","goes too hard at this fullish length ball and loses shape as he swings, skewed off the toe-end into the off side"
15.5,"Morris to Russell, no run",makes some room to a back of a length delivery and deftly opens the face to drop it to short third man
15.4,"Morris to Rana, 1 run","yorker outside off, backs away and ekes out an inside edge into the leg side"
15.3,"Morris to Rana, FOUR runs","slower short ball, Rana does superbly to hold his shape. Front foot out of the way and a gentle glide over backward point. Picks the gap nicely"
15.2,"Morris to Rana, no run","short of a length, backs away and tries to ramp it over and the ball shoots over the bat"
15.1,"Morris to Rana, SIX runs","short ball, angled across him, and Rana flays a pull over midwicket. Another massive hit"
14.6,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs","oh, that's huge! That's a massive strike. So much power in those arms as he backs away to a short one and lofts it over deep midwicket with the angle. Miles into the stands"
14.5,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs","full on off-stump, gives himself a little room, and he lifts it straight over long-off with a straight bat"
14.4,"Shami to Russell, 2 runs","dropped. Roy gets around it but does not time his dive well. Russell gets a top-edge on this slow short delivery and with no room, he skewed it off the toe-end"
14.3,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs","shot! A short one that climbs into him hurriedly, and Russell jumps and flays it over the third man region with a well-timed ramp"
14.2,"Shami to Rana, 1 run","slower ball again, finds the inside edge of Rana's bat as he tries to drill it through the off side"
14.1,"Shami to Russell, 1 run","back of a length, nips away outside off, dropped into cover for one"
13.6,"Morris to Rana, no run",tapped to point and he is sent back
13.5,"Morris to Rana, SIX runs","that's another poor delivery. Morris is nicely feeding to the batsmen's strengths here. Lots of room outside off, and all he swings across without moving his feet but still manages good meat to clear long-on by a distance"
13.4,"Morris to Karthik, OUT","and attempts a third hit through the same region, but Gambhir had Boult from square leg after those two boundaries, and Karthik knocks it straight into the hands of the fielder there"
13.3,"Morris to Karthik, FOUR runs","one ball after being dispatched for four, Morris offers the same delivery again, and Karthik responds with the same shot. Through midwicket"
13.2,"Morris to Karthik, FOUR runs","fullish length, flicked off the pads, just a pick-up shot over midwicket"
13.1,"Morris to Rana, 1 run","slower length ball around middle and leg, drops it into the off side for a quick one"
12.6,"Shami to Rana, 1 run",hangs back to a length ball and opens the face to third man
12.5,"Shami to Karthik, 1 run","has that swung away? Karthik throws his hands hard at a length ball, it's a swipe across the line. It's a kuckle ball and lobs in the air off the outside edge"
12.4,"Shami to Rana, 1 run","back of a length around off, waits and opens the face to third man"
12.3,"Shami to Karthik, 1 run","good length around off, lets it come on before opening the face to run it down to third man"
12.2,"Shami to Karthik, 2 runs",plays across another skiddy fullish length ball and gets a leading edge through the covers. Boult fires in a quick throw running in from the sweeper boundary
12.1,"Shami to Karthik, no run",given! Shami hits the pad of Karthik and it seemed pretty plumb. But Karthik has no hesitation in going for the review. Could he have got an inside edge? This may be too high. Shami gets this to skid in off a length and Karthik has indeed got an inside edge on the flick. And it seems as though the ball may have gone over as well
11.6,"Shankar to Rana, no run","moves across and tries to clip a leg-stump fuller one, gets hit on the pad as it rolls to the keeper. Appeal for leg before withheld"
11.5,"Shankar to Karthik, 1 run","length ball around off, punched into the covers for one"
11.4,"Shankar to Karthik, SIX runs","shortish, angled in and tucked up for room, and Karthik gets the top-edge on the pull as he steps down, and sends it soaring over deep backward square leg"
11.3,"Shankar to Rana, 1 run",on the pads this time as Rana flicks to backward square leg and slips in his hurry to get back for the second. Has to settle for one
11.2,"Shankar to Rana, FOUR runs","short of a length, no pace, and again stops on him a little as he swivels and pulls to deep square leg"
11.1,"Shankar to Rana, no run","starts off neatly with a fuller one on the stumps, clipped into the leg side"
10.6,"Shami to Karthik, no run","short of a length, stops on him a little as he closes the face early and gets an inside edge into the pad"
10.6,"Shami to Karthik, 1 wide","slower short ball, gets up too much, and called a wide"
10.5,"Shami to Lynn, OUT","good catch from Jason Roy at long-on. Again no room for Lynn as Shami angles in a knuckle ball to his middle and leg stumps. Lynn miscues it, gets no power behind it, and Roy dives in front to snaffle a smart catch"
10.4,"Shami to Lynn, no run","back of a length, angled into him, backs away and swings across the line to get beaten"
10.3,"Shami to Lynn, 2 runs","short of a length, backs away and absolutely shovels it, reaches Boult in seconds and he does well to stop it at deep point"
10.2,"Shami to Rana, 1 run","short and angled across, a bit of extra bounce as he slaps it off the upper portion of the bat to deep backward point"
10.1,"Shami to Lynn, 1 run","short of good length, angled into the body, turned away into the leg side"
9.6,"Nadeem to Rana, no run","Nadeem belts out an appeal for a leg before as Rana gets down to sweep and is hit on the pad. Not out is the on-field call, and it seems as though the impact may be outside off, but Nadeem convinces Gambhir to go for the review. Oops, seems like it may be well outside off. Also got to rule out the under-edge on the sweep. That seems alright, and the impact is miles outside off. Horrific review"
9.5,"Nadeem to Lynn, 1 run","short of a length, straightening around middle, Lynn backs away and slaps it to sweeper cover"
9.4,"Nadeem to Rana, 1 run",advances down the ground and drills this to long-on
9.3,"Nadeem to Rana, FOUR runs",floats this up around the fourth-stump channel and Rana sweeps with the turn to backward square leg
9.2,"Nadeem to Rana, SIX runs","Nadeem fires this one a length, and Rana advances down the ground and launches this over long-on"
9.1,"Nadeem to Rana, 2 runs","short, and though it spins into him, there's enough room to open up for a hard slap to the right of sweeper cover"
8.6,"Tewatia to Rana, 1 run","good length on leg stump, big stride and he tickles it to short fine"
8.5,"Tewatia to Rana, no run",length ball outside off. Gets down and looks for the reverse-whip. But he's through it early and cops it on the body
8.4,"Tewatia to Rana, SIX runs","this is high and it's far enough. Length ball on middle and he gets down for the slog sweep. Appears to have got too far under it, but he has hit it cleanly"
8.3,"Tewatia to Rana, no run","length on off stump, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
8.2,"Tewatia to Rana, no run",thick outside edge against the googly. Looks to drive this length ball through cover and is reaching out a long way with his hands in the end
8.1,"Tewatia to Rana, no run","short of a length just outside off, opens the face and runs it straight to short third man"
7.6,"Nadeem to Rana, 1 run",short of a length and spinning in at off stump. Gets deep in the crease and pushes through midwicket
7.5,"Nadeem to Lynn, 1 run",arm ball hurries him as he backs into the leg side. Just manages to chop this to sweeper cover
7.4,"Nadeem to Lynn, no run","short of a length on off stump, backs away and taps to extra cover on the up"
7.3,"Nadeem to Uthappa, OUT",top edge is taken this time. Looks like Uthappa was late on the slog sweep this time. Nadeem gets some grip from a good length and marginal turn away from off stump. He completes a simple catch too
7.2,"Nadeem to Lynn, 1 run","short ball outside off, backs away and cuts to sweeper cover"
7.1,"Nadeem to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length outside off, low skidder. Gets on the back foot and drags this to long-on's right"
6.6,"Tewatia to Lynn, no run","googly on a middle stump line, pushed anxiously back down the pitch"
6.5,"Tewatia to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length, bowled with the front of the hand. Gets on the back foot and punches to long-on"
6.4,"Tewatia to Lynn, 1 run","length on middle, flicked to deep midwicket"
6.3,"Tewatia to Uthappa, 1 run",top edge lands between short third and short fine. Lucky. It's a very slow short ball and he's through the pull too early. Keeper doesn't know where it is as this lifts over his head and the fielders can't reach it
6.2,"Tewatia to Uthappa, SIX runs","he isn't taking kindly to the demotion! In the mood today, Uthappa. No nudging around - puts a big front foot stride out and meets it as it lands on the pitch to send the slog sweep into orbit"
6.1,"Tewatia to Lynn, 1 run","tossed up at middle stump, allows it to come on and nudges it to deep midwicket from the crease"
5.6,"Nadeem to Uthappa, no run","good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
5.5,"Nadeem to Uthappa, FOUR runs",deft. Nadeem in panic mode. Looks for the arm ball but drops it very short and very wide. Uthappa lets it come on and caresses it past cover point
5.4,"Nadeem to Uthappa, SIX runs",hammers it straight over the bowler's head off the back foot. Incredible shot. Not a lot of pace from the spinner but he gets it to clear the fence easily as he gets behind the line in front of off stump
5.3,"Nadeem to Uthappa, 2 runs","short of a length on leg stump, gets behind the line and taps it to deep midwicket's right. Works hard to come back for the second"
5.2,"Nadeem to Uthappa, SIX runs",oh yes. Right off the middle. Nadeem goes flat and on a length at leg stump. It skids through unlike the previous ball and Uthappa hits cleanly through the line to send this far over deep midwicket
5.1,"Nadeem to Uthappa, no run","beats the outside edge with a nicely landed length ball, drifting in at off stump and spinning sharply away"
4.6,"Boult to Lynn, FOUR runs","mis-hit. Again.. It's a full toss on middle and he goes across the line and lifts this in long-on's direction but Morris, running in, can't get there or get his body behind to stop it"
4.5,"Boult to Lynn, FOUR runs",inside half but hit well enough to find the long-off boundary. Length ball coming in at off stump. He backs away and hammers it past the bowler
4.4,"Boult to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, drops it into the off side with soft hands and steals a run"
4.3,"Boult to Uthappa, FOUR runs","shot. Classic Uthappa. Length ball on middle stump, half a stride across off stump and a clean punch straight over the bowler on the up"
4.2,"Boult to Uthappa, no run",beaten as he looks to run this past slip. Length ball in the corridor
4.1,"Boult to Uthappa, no run","good length on leg stump, tapped straight to short midwicket"
3.6,"Nadeem to Lynn, no run",grip off the pitch and a leading edge as Lynn tries to flick through midwicket. Loopy length ball on off stump and he closes the face too early
3.5,"Nadeem to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, tapped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
3.4,"Nadeem to Lynn, 1 run",slider at leg stump. Skidding in from a length and gets the inside half of the bat and dribbles past non-striker. He was looking to punch through the off side
3.3,"Nadeem to Lynn, FOUR runs",dropped marginally short on a leg stump line. He backs away and slaps it through cover
3.2,"Nadeem to Lynn, no run",length and skidding in at middle stump. Backs away and pushes to mid-off
3.1,"Nadeem to Uthappa, 1 run",length ball pushed in at middle stump from around the wicket. Plants the front leg across and taps it through the open midwicket region
2.6,"Boult to Lynn, FOUR runs",slap. Lynn gets room outside off and he duly sends it flying over point. Right off the middle this time. Short from Boult but not climbing up enough to cause trouble
2.5,"Boult to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length in the corridor, watchfully poked on the up and he gets it out to third man off the thick outside edge"
2.4,"Boult to Uthappa, no run",good length and past the outside edge. Uthappa late on the forward push as this slants away
2.3,"Boult to Narine, OUT","Pant lobs it up, slip completes the catch. Is it the second bouncer? The umpires are checking .it's just under the shoulder. We all know the theory. Short ball to Narine. Boult goes with that, cramps him on the hook and gets it to tickle the top edge. Pant leaps up, one-handed, but he can't hold on. Slip has a few yards to cover behind and completes a simple catch"
2.2,"Boult to Narine, no run",nicely done. Bouncer at an off stump line. Narine backs away again to try and slice over slip. Well beaten
2.1,"Boult to Narine, no run","yorker speared in at middle stump. Narine backs away and tries to squeeze it behind point, but he can only jam it into the leg side"
1.6,"Morris to Lynn, no run","short of a length just outside off, mistimed punch on the up, straight to mid-off"
1.5,"Morris to Lynn, no run",beaten again. Length ball jags away from off stump. Lynn gets too far leg side of it and is swishing aimlessly in the end
1.4,"Morris to Lynn, SIX runs","off the mark with a six, but it's not well-timed. Length ball at leg stump and that's what he needs to bring in the slog. Drags it over the midwicket boundary"
1.3,"Morris to Lynn, no run","short of a length again, cramped at chest height this time. Swats and makes connection this time, but it's straight to midwicket off the inside half of the bat"
1.2,"Morris to Lynn, no run","beaten on the inside edge. Morris bangs it in again, gets it to nip back off the seam. It's waist height as Lynn backs away to try and swat this behind square."
1.1,"Morris to Narine, 1 run",short of a length in the corridor. More lift off the surface than he anticipates as he tries to stab it through the off side. Gets a thick inside edge to dribble through square leg
0.6,"Boult to Lynn, no run","full toss outside off, drilled straight to cover. That's a maiden, against Lynn. The first one of the season."
0.5,"Boult to Lynn, no run","beats the off stump! Lynn exposes the stumps and it looks like he's anticipating the ball to swing into him from an off stump line. Wants to drill it through cover, but this ball goes straight through with the angle"
0.4,"Boult to Lynn, no run","short of a length just outside off, wafts at it on the up but misses"
0.3,"Boult to Lynn, no run","good length on off stump, punched on the up to cover"
0.2,"Boult to Lynn, no run",short ball climbing up and into the corridor. Leaps off the ground and runs it straight to short third man
0.1,"Boult to Lynn, no run",full inswinger coming towards leg stump. Lynn shuffles around a little before managing to get the bat down to block it
19.6,"Sharma to Dhoni, SIX runs","oh, he's finished it off with a six! A six! If only this had come a ball earlier. Things could have been so different. Ah, the hurt of it all if you're Dhoni. An extremely full delivery on middle, Dhoni sends it soaring into the sky and straight over for a monstrous six"
19.5,"Sharma to Dhoni, no run","is that four, is that four? No. Deep point cuts it off. Dhoni steps down the track and squeezes this out through the covers. Deep point gets around to his right. Dhoni does not take the single"
19.4,"Sharma to Dhoni, no run","excellent! Wide yorker, bang on the line. An inch here or there and it was a wide. But it's right inside. Top stuff from Mohit. Dhoni brings the bat down and just hits the ground"
19.3,"Sharma to Dhoni, FOUR runs","beautiful shot! They needed four fours in four balls, and that's the first of 'em. Superb placement as he squeezes out a wide fuller one between point and backward point"
19.3,"Sharma to Dhoni, 1 wide","tries an encore and it's drifted away too much. Tension building. Mohit needs to hold his own here. Dhoni has loads of experience in these situations. Injured back or not, you don't want to be bowling to him in these situations"
19.2,"Sharma to Dhoni, no run","great delivery. A wide yorker, making Dhoni reach. With that sore back, it's asking him to do the impossible. Beaten"
19.1,"Sharma to Bravo, 1 run","good yorker, angled into Bravo's pads as he clips to deep midwicket"
18.6,"Tye to Dhoni, SIX runs",six more! MS Dhoni is doing the unthinkable here! And he's down on one knee after that shot. A full toss that angles into him and that angle makes up for the lack of power because of the injury. Swung away over square leg
18.5,"Tye to Dhoni, 2 runs","in the air, and a moment of excitement as the ball lobs in the air. Not very well-timed and it lands short of long-off"
18.4,"Tye to Dhoni, FOUR runs","overcompensates with a short ball and with the line too which is well outside off, and Dhoni ramps it over short third man! Oh the drama!"
18.3,"Tye to Dhoni, SIX runs",that's a bad ball. You don't bowl a wide length ball like that to a batsman on fifty-odd in the penultimate over. A free swing of the arms as he smokes it way over long-on
18.2,"Tye to Jadeja, OUT","and there ends Jadeja's underwhelming stay. Full and angled across, and that drift does him in as he skews it in the air off the outside of the bat with Ashwin is waiting under it at extra cover"
18.1,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 run","full around off, drilled very hard down to long-on"
17.6,"Sharma to Jadeja, SIX runs",six! Another huge hit. Jadeja gets into the act. And it was about time he did so! A length ball that Jadeja gets on top of from the crease and hammers over long-on
17.5,"Sharma to Dhoni, 1 run","short, wide, makes Dhoni reach out and he can't because of the injury, chops it into the surface. And that's fifty for Dhoni"
17.4,"Sharma to Dhoni, SIX runs","humongous hit from Dhoni! A juicy half-volley, right in the slot for Dhoni to get underneath it and bludgeon it miles in the air and over cow corner"
17.3,"Sharma to Jadeja, 1 run",Jadeja drills a fuller one very hard back at the bowler and Mohit bumps into Dhoni as he moves to his right to try and stop it
17.2,"Sharma to Dhoni, 1 run",steps down the track to meet a low full toss and hammers it to long-off. Just one. Back giving lots of trouble
17.1,"Sharma to Dhoni, FOUR runs",in the air and missed chance. Mayank Dagar dives forward but the ball dips horribly on him and ends up sneaking from underneath to the boundary. A full toss that Dhoni shovelled to the deep midwicket region
16.6,"Tye to Jadeja, FOUR runs",Jadeja still can't get hold of his shots but he'll get four for this. A slow short of a length delivery that he backs away to and manages to chip over the in-field at the cover and point region
16.5,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 run","full outside off, driven to long-off"
16.4,"Tye to Dhoni, FOUR runs",shoveled! Tremendous back-hand power as Dhoni slams this slower back of a length delivery through long-off. Wouldn't have mattered if you had all your fielders there
16.4,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 wide","full, drifts away too far outside off. Not bothered with by Dhoni"
16.3,"Tye to Jadeja, 1 run","shortish, and Jadeja gently pulls it through square leg"
16.2,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 run",lots of bottom hand power as he flays a full one outside off past Jadeja who is forced to arch his back. Dhoni limps the single
16.1,"Tye to Dhoni, no run","full and wide, Dhoni brings the bat down to drive and makes no contact. Not much feet"
15.6,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, 2 runs","full toss, booming drive through the covers by Jadeja. Sweeper moves across to his left and they take him on for the second. Sran slips on the follow through and get behind the stumps to gather the throw as Dhoni comes rushing back"
15.5,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, no run",this is brilliant death bowling. A wide yorker and all Jadeja can do is dig it out to point
15.4,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, 2 runs","short ball, Jadeja doesn't get hold of it again as he mistimes a pull to backward square leg"
15.4,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, 1 wide",was that a wide? Touch and go. Very full and out of Jadeja's reach. Seemed like it was probably just within the line but the umpire thinks otherwise
15.3,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, 2 runs","short, cuts into Jadeja and gives him no pace, pulled away backward of square leg and this time they charge back for the second. Rahul takes the bails off after gathering the throw but Jadeja's well inside"
15.3,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, 1 wide","slower ball, dips late and sneaks down the leg side"
15.2,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, no run","full, wide, in the blockhole, Jadeja jams the bat down and makes no contact"
15.1,"Barinder Sran to Dhoni, 1 run","shortish, some width, slapped away to the sweeper at the cover boundary"
14.6,"Ashwin to Dhoni, 1 run",slides into Dhoni's pads and it trickles into the leg side off the pads
14.5,"Ashwin to Jadeja, 1 run","flat back of a length delivery, almost a seam-up as he fires it in at pace, turned away to backward square leg"
14.4,"Ashwin to Dhoni, 1 run","short and some width, Dhoni slaps it through the covers off the backfoot"
14.3,"Ashwin to Dhoni, SIX runs",there's the biggie. Much-needed six from Dhoni. He's struggling with a sore back and it's slowed him down. But the power's still there as he slogs this over deep square leg
14.2,"Ashwin to Dhoni, no run","shortish, some width, Dhoni chops a cut to cover"
14.1,"Ashwin to Dhoni, no run",a length ball that slides in and hits Dhoni in front of leg as he misses the flick
13.6,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, no run",another yes and no. Dhoni sends Jadeja back but he manages to get back in comfortably after tapping a slower one to midwicket
13.5,"Barinder Sran to Jadeja, no run","short of a length, opens the face to point"
13.4,"Barinder Sran to Rayudu, OUT",Ashwin with a direct hit. And look at him take off. And look at the Kings XI dugout. A lightning quick piece of fielding from Ashwin. Rayudu drills it to extra cover and Ashwin just swoops down in a flash and nails a direct hit at the striker's end after Dhoni sends Rayudu back
13.3,"Barinder Sran to Rayudu, no run","back-of-the-hand slower delivery, Rayudu backs away and leaves it hoping for a wide. But well inside"
13.2,"Barinder Sran to Rayudu, SIX runs",a timely six from Rayudu breaks the shackles. Shuffles across to a shortish delivery and heaves a pull over backward square leg
13.1,"Barinder Sran to Rayudu, no run",Rayudu skips down the track but Sran shortens the length and Rayudu slightly chips it in the air. Well short of the bowler
12.6,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 run",comes down the track and drills to long-off
12.5,"Ashwin to Dhoni, 1 run","short and spinning away, cut away to sweeper cover"
12.4,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 run",
12.3,"Ashwin to Dhoni, 1 leg bye",tries to flick and the ball slides in to lob off the pad into the off side. Missing leg
12.2,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 run",meets the pitch with a good stride forward and drills it away to the left of sweeper cover
12.1,"Ashwin to Dhoni, 1 run","minimal turn around off, backs away and carves a cut through backward point"
11.6,"Mujeeb to Rayudu, 2 runs","short of a length, gets down on one knee and pulls to deep midwicket"
11.5,"Mujeeb to Dhoni, 1 run","low full toss, driven out to sweeper cover"
11.4,"Mujeeb to Dhoni, no run",tries to force a cut with little room and misses
11.3,"Mujeeb to Dhoni, 2 runs","short of a length, flattens the trajectory and drifts it in, and Dhoni whips it away to deep fine leg. And Dhoni breezes back for the second"
11.2,"Mujeeb to Rayudu, 1 run",this one spins in from a length and Rayudu punches to long-off
11.1,"Mujeeb to Dhoni, 1 run","legbreak, short of a length, stays back and makes room to punch through cover"
10.6,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 run","full, driven through cover for one"
10.5,"Tye to Rayudu, 1 run","slower full one, driven to long-off"
10.4,"Tye to Rayudu, FOUR runs","short and wide, slapped away to deep point"
10.3,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 run",gets on top of a short one and taps it to backward point
10.2,"Tye to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, opens the face to point"
10.1,"Tye to Dhoni, 1 run","full on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
9.6,"Mujeeb to Dhoni, 1 run",shuffles across early and then awkwardly flicks it away to square leg for one
9.5,"Mujeeb to Rayudu, 1 run","flat, back of a length, pulled away to deep backward square leg"
9.4,"Mujeeb to Dhoni, 1 run","quicker one on the pads, worked away to square leg"
9.3,"Mujeeb to Dhoni, no run",shifts back and hurriedly punches it into the off side as it bounces extra
9.2,"Mujeeb to Dhoni, no run","length ball on off, Dhoni punches from the crease"
9.1,"Mujeeb to Rayudu, 1 run","flat length ball, punched down to long-on"
8.6,"Ashwin to Dhoni, FOUR runs","oh, that's a stunning shot! Came out of nowhere. You didn't actually realise it was a four until you saw how well he had placed that. A length ball that turns away and he simply waits and waits before punching it through backward point"
8.5,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 run",
8.5,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 wide",drifts it in down the leg side again
8.4,"Ashwin to Rayudu, no run",finds the outside edge with turn ad bounce from middle and leg as the ball trickles away into the off side
8.4,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 wide",sprayed down the leg side
8.3,"Ashwin to Rayudu, FOUR runs","floats it up too much and offers up a full toss, a rare legbreak that Ashwin isn't in control of, and it's whipped away to deep square leg"
8.2,"Ashwin to Dhoni, 1 run","turning away outside off, cut away to sweeper cover"
8.1,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 run","floats up a legbreak on middle and leg, clipped through midwicket"
7.6,"Yuvraj to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length, punched down to long-on"
7.5,"Yuvraj to Dhoni, 1 run",stays back to a length ball and uses the angle to flick to deep square leg
7.5,"Yuvraj to Dhoni, 1 wide",slides down the leg side and sneaks past Dhoni's attempt to clip it
7.4,"Yuvraj to Dhoni, FOUR runs","short, offers up width, that's not where you bowl at a new batsman, Dhoni cuts hard and cuts late through backward point"
7.3,"Yuvraj to Rayudu, 1 run",
7.2,"Yuvraj to Dhoni, 1 run","boy did he slam that! A savage Dhoni strike, all timing, but the placement's not so great as long-on gets around it comfortably despite how quickly that left the bat"
7.1,"Yuvraj to Rayudu, 1 run","floated up outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
6.6,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length, Rayudu gets behind the line and flicks to midwicket"
6.5,"Ashwin to Dhoni, 1 run","another legbreak, make that three in a row, Dhoni reaches out and drives to long-off"
6.4,"Ashwin to Billings, OUT","will Ashwin review that? Appeals for the leg before but the signal is four off the bat. Yes, he goes for it. Another legbreak from Ashwin. Floats it up just enough to entice Billings to get down and sweep. There is absolutely no bat involved, which seemed pretty obvious to start off. UltraEdge confirms it, and three reds on Hawkeye as ball crashes into off-stump. Good review. Ashwin was super-confident of that and you could see why. That seemed pretty plumb from the outset"
6.3,"Ashwin to Billings, no run",there's the legbreak. Sussed out by Billings who cuts to cover
6.2,"Ashwin to Billings, 2 runs",comes down the track and works this length ball with the turn to midwicket
6.1,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length, minimal turn, punched to long-off"
5.6,"Mujeeb to Rayudu, 1 run",turned away with the spin to backward square leg
5.5,"Mujeeb to Rayudu, no run","shortish, gets a little big on him as he shifts back to pull and gets hit high on the front pad. Easily missing leg"
5.4,"Mujeeb to Rayudu, no run","fullish length outside off, driven into cover"
5.3,"Mujeeb to Billings, 1 run",shifts back and punches this past mid-on diving to his left
5.2,"Mujeeb to Billings, FOUR runs",just helped along. A googly that pitches around leg and spins away further down that line and all Billings has to do is put bat to ball to work it away through fine leg
5.1,"Mujeeb to Rayudu, 1 run","there's that deceptive trajectory right away, Rayudu reaches out and gets an outside edge to third man"
4.6,"Tye to Billings, 2 runs",full on the pads flicked off them to the left of deep square leg
4.5,"Tye to Billings, no run",rides the bounce of a shortish one and opens the face to point
4.4,"Tye to Billings, no run","length on off, 130.5ks, flicked to midwicket"
4.3,"Tye to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length, runs down to third man with an open face"
4.2,"Tye to Rayudu, FOUR runs","leg-side length ball, flicked off the hips to deep fine leg"
4.1,"Tye to Vijay, OUT","Sran with another catch and he's too chuffed again as he hurls the ball in the air. Vijay steps down the track, completely foxed by the slower one from Tye, and chips it in the air. Sran snaffles it at extra cover"
3.6,"Sharma to Vijay, 1 run",flicked to square leg
3.5,"Sharma to Rayudu, 1 run","slower back of a length delivery, opens the face to point"
3.4,"Sharma to Rayudu, FOUR runs",down the ground and through the vacant long-on region as Rayudu smokes it with the inward angle
3.3,"Sharma to Vijay, 1 run","back of a length at 129.9ks, chips a punch in the air but lands short of mid-off"
3.2,"Sharma to Rayudu, 1 run","length ball on off, punched to mid-off for a quick one"
3.1,"Sharma to Rayudu, no run","full on middle and off, drilled down to mid-on"
2.6,"Barinder Sran to Vijay, SIX runs",that's too short. Ruins what was a good over as Vijay deposits it well over midwicket with a ferocious pull
2.5,"Barinder Sran to Vijay, 2 runs","a length ball with some room, opens the face real late to stab it to third man"
2.4,"Barinder Sran to Rayudu, 1 run","full, angled in, flicked to midwicket"
2.3,"Barinder Sran to Rayudu, FOUR runs","that's sublime timing! A length ball that pitches on middle and is slanted across, Rayudu drives past Ashwin diving to his right at mid-off"
2.2,"Barinder Sran to Vijay, 1 run","slower length ball at leg-stump, 100.6ks - could it get any slower? - as Vijay knocks it to point"
2.1,"Barinder Sran to Vijay, no run",tries to flick a leg-side fuller one and wears it on the pad
1.6,"Sharma to Watson, OUT",there's the early wicket that Kings XI were looking for as Watson's caught at short fine leg. A back-of-the-hand slower ball from Mohit and Watson tries to whip it through the leg side. Gets the timing all wrong and skews it in the air off the leading edge
1.5,"Sharma to Watson, no run","back of a length on off, punched with an open face to Agarwal at backward point"
1.4,"Sharma to Watson, no run",opens the face very late to punch a length ball to backward point
1.3,"Sharma to Watson, FOUR runs",deft! Hangs back in the crease and opens the face of his bat to a short of a length delivery and beats short third man diving to his left
1.2,"Sharma to Watson, FOUR runs","full, shapes away to find the outside of his bat as he throws his hands at it and clears the in-field over point"
1.1,"Sharma to Watson, no run","fullish on off, punched to cover"
0.6,"Barinder Sran to Watson, 1 run","too straight again, nudged down to short fine leg for a run. Nine off the opening over."
0.5,"Barinder Sran to Vijay, 1 run","too straight, on the hips and worked to square leg for a run"
0.4,"Barinder Sran to Watson, 1 run","good stop from Mujeeb. Short and wide outside off, carved away over backward point. Third man gets across to his right, and does a good job to stop the ball."
0.3,"Barinder Sran to Vijay, 1 leg bye","a full delivery, on middle and leg, off the pad to square leg. An optimistic appeal."
0.2,"Barinder Sran to Vijay, no run","a good length delivery outside off, some inward shape. Carved away to extra cover."
0.2,"Barinder Sran to Vijay, 1 wide","starts the inswinger too straight again. Strays down leg, wide!"
0.1,"Barinder Sran to Watson, 1 run","back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point. A good call from Vijay"
0.1,"Barinder Sran to Watson, 3 wide","a sloppy start. Full and swinging down leg, a wide. Rahul dives to his left, but can only half-stop it. So three free runs for CSK."
19.6,"Bravo to Tye, 2 runs","low full toss, punched to the left of deep midwicket, and they push back for the second"
19.5,"Bravo to Tye, no run",shifts down the leg side and it's another slower one as Tye swings without a clue about what he's doing. Beaten
19.4,"Bravo to Nair, OUT",goes for a big heave over the leg side and he's picked out Jadeja at deep midwicket who takes it reverse-cupped. Slower ball from Bravo does the trick as he messes up the timing by rolling his fingers over this delivery
19.3,"Bravo to Tye, 1 run","wide yorker, pushed across from around the stumps, squeezed out to cover"
19.2,"Bravo to Tye, no run",advances looking for a slog and ends up swinging early due to the lack of pace
19.1,"Bravo to Nair, 1 run","full ball from around the wicket, knocked to deep midwicket"
18.6,"Thakur to Nair, 3 runs","length ball outside off, flayed through the gap at extra cover. Long-off runs to his left and slides across. Gets a hand and seems to have done alright as they go upstairs to check"
18.5,"Thakur to Ashwin, OUT",no room on the pull as Ashwin shifts right back and gets a top-edge that Dhoni runs to his left to catch
18.4,"Thakur to Ashwin, SIX runs","length ball on the pads, Ashwin carts it off the pads over deep fine leg as the ball sails over Vijay leaping up. Could he have caught it if he was further back at the boundary?"
18.3,"Thakur to Nair, 1 run","short of a length, sitting up nicely, pulled one-bounce to deep midwicket"
18.2,"Thakur to Ashwin, 1 run","length ball outside off, Ashwin jabs it to mid-off who loses the ball as he tries to stop it"
18.1,"Thakur to Ashwin, 2 runs",makes room and slams to the right of sweeper cover
17.6,"Bravo to Ashwin, 1 run","slower full ball, punched down to long-on"
17.5,"Bravo to Nair, 1 run","full, flicked powerfully off the pads to deep midwicket"
17.4,"Bravo to Nair, 2 runs","good length, drilled wide of midwicket"
17.3,"Bravo to Nair, FOUR runs","another poor delivery. A length ball, angled into the pads, and Nair flicks to fine leg"
17.2,"Bravo to Nair, SIX runs","has that been dropped?. Jadeja has hurt his hand quite badly, seems like. And it's his bowling hand. Karun whacked this full toss over deep midwicket and Jadeja leaps and the ball flicks his thumb before continuing on its path over the boundary"
17.1,"Bravo to Ashwin, 1 run","slower length ball, drops to point with an open face"
16.6,"Tahir to Ashwin, 1 run",flicks a length ball to deep midwicket. Just five off the 17th
16.5,"Tahir to Ashwin, no run","full and accurate on middle, defended back. Dots at the slog worth gold"
16.4,"Tahir to Ashwin, no run","fullish length on middle and leg, pushed back"
16.3,"Tahir to Nair, 1 run",floats up a fuller one outside off and he drives down to long-off
16.2,"Tahir to Nair, 2 runs","back of a length, backs away and punches through the cover"
16.1,"Tahir to Ashwin, 1 run","flat fuller one, clipped to deep midwicket"
15.6,"Thakur to Nair, 2 runs","short outside off, not entirely on top of it as he pulls to cow corner"
15.5,"Thakur to Nair, no run",hangs the bat out to a wide back of a length delivery and gets beaten
15.4,"Thakur to Ashwin, 1 run",angles in a length ball and Ashwin drills it off the inside of the bat to deep backward square leg
15.3,"Thakur to Yuvraj, OUT","is that an edge? Oh, yeah! Tucked up for room and some extra bounce too that does him in. Yuvraj is trying to slap this over but gets a feather to the keeper. Gone for 20 but he Kings XI will be pleased he didn't scratch around"
15.2,"Thakur to Yuvraj, 2 runs","short, wide, slapped past point diving to his left"
15.1,"Thakur to Nair, 1 run","short of a length, jumps and opens the face to third man"
14.6,"Tahir to Nair, 1 run","leg-stump fuller one, flicked to short fine leg"
14.5,"Tahir to Nair, FOUR runs","full on middle and leg, flicked away off the pads and beats deep midwicket to his left"
14.4,"Tahir to Nair, no run","pitched up around off, blocked into the off side"
14.3,"Tahir to Nair, no run","googly, spins in from a back of a length, and Nair punches to cover"
14.2,"Tahir to Finch, OUT","Tahir strikes again, and it's another golden duck for Finch! Or is it? Finch reviews. But this was a poor shot from Finch. Pays the price for playing against the turn. A length ball and Finch clumsily steps forward and looks to close the face. The ball spins past it to hit the pad. A waste of a review, really, as the screen shows three reds"
14.1,"Tahir to Agarwal, OUT","Agarwal miscues one to long-on. Tahir floats up a length ball and Agarwal's bat turned in his hands as he tried to loft it. Doesn't get the distance desired as a result, and Jadeja completes a simple catch"
13.6,"Bravo to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","yorker from Bravo, and it goes away for four. Didn't really deserve a boundary. Bravo belts out an appeal for the lbw, but it's withheld. The ball, in the meanwhile, trickles away past a diving Harbhajan at short third man"
13.5,"Bravo to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","short, sitting up outside off, and Yuvraj gets on his toes inside the crease and pulls to the right of deep midwicket"
13.4,"Bravo to Yuvraj, 2 runs","slower full toss, teasing the line with the height here, Yuvraj flicks it to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Bravo to Agarwal, 1 run","full, wide, flayed over point by Agarwal as Vijay runs to his left from sweeper cover to field it"
13.2,"Bravo to Yuvraj, 1 run","shortish outside off, backs away and slaps it out to sweeper cover"
13.1,"Bravo to Agarwal, 1 run","full toss that slips out of the hand, whipped away between deep midwicket and long-on"
12.6,"Tahir to Yuvraj, no run",slants across a length ball outside off and Yuvraj punches down the pitch
12.5,"Tahir to Yuvraj, no run","shortish, a googly that spins away, Yuvraj knocks it to point"
12.4,"Tahir to Yuvraj, SIX runs","that's an easy one, just the kind of delivery you want as a batsman when you're out of form. A clean swing of the arms to dispatch a full, flighted one over long-on"
12.3,"Tahir to Yuvraj, no run","fullish on middle, driven straight back"
12.2,"Tahir to Yuvraj, no run","floats up a length ball around off, solidly blocked off the front foot"
12.1,"Tahir to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball, spinning away, leans early into a punch to long-off"
11.6,"Watson to Yuvraj, no run","back of a length on middle, flicked into the on side"
11.5,"Watson to Agarwal, 1 run","shortish, a little width, hangs back and runs it down to third man"
11.4,"Watson to Yuvraj, 1 run","short of a length, angled across, jumps up and flicks to midwicket"
11.3,"Watson to Gayle, OUT","a rather underwhelming end to a superb innings. He was kept quiet for the last couple of overs or so, and now he's offered a simple catch to short fine leg. Watson tucks him up for room and bangs it in, Gayle gets an edge as he tries to pull it away"
11.2,"Watson to Agarwal, 1 run","shortish, some width, slapped to the sweeper at the cover boundary"
11.1,"Watson to Agarwal, SIX runs","Watson offers up a dolly, a really full one at 129.2 clicks on middle and off, Agarwal clears the front leg and sends it soaring straight over"
10.6,"Bravo to Agarwal, 1 run",walks forward to a slower length ball and taps it through midwicket
10.5,"Bravo to Agarwal, no run",
10.4,"Bravo to Gayle, 1 run","full, outside off, carved out to backward point"
10.3,"Bravo to Agarwal, 1 run",misfield at mid-off as Agarwal watchfully blocks towards the fielder and sends back Gayle looking for one. The fielder lets it slip through the legs and they take the one anyway
10.2,"Bravo to Gayle, 1 run","low full toss, slanted across, pushed down to long-off"
10.1,"Bravo to Agarwal, 1 run","full, wide, reaches out and stabs it to sweeper cover"
9.6,"Harbhajan to Gayle, no run","length ball that spins away, Gayle watchfully blocks in the direction of point"
9.5,"Harbhajan to Agarwal, 1 run","leg-side fuller one, swept on the bounce to deep backward square leg"
9.4,"Harbhajan to Agarwal, FOUR runs",brilliant from Agarwal. Uses the width to open the face really late and squeezes it out through backward point
9.3,"Harbhajan to Agarwal, SIX runs",Agarwal invites himself to the party with a straight six. Just how many have travelled that way tonight? A skip down the track and a neatly-timed punch over long-on
9.2,"Harbhajan to Gayle, 1 run","leg-stump length ball, tucked to square leg"
9.1,"Harbhajan to Agarwal, 1 run","floated up on middle and leg, chipped down to long-on"
8.6,"Watson to Agarwal, 1 run","back of a length on off, opens the face for a single behind point"
8.5,"Watson to Gayle, 1 run",quietly pushes out a fullish one to cover
8.4,"Watson to Agarwal, 1 run",off the middle this time as he pulls it out to deep midwicket. 100 up in the ninth over. Shades of the Mumbai-DD game yesterday
8.3,"Watson to Agarwal, no run","short, too close to Agarwal as he miscues a pull off the lower part of the bat"
8.2,"Watson to Agarwal, 2 runs","length ball, gets away from him late as he chips it in the air. Lands safely around the sweeper cover region"
8.1,"Watson to Gayle, 1 run","length, angled across, Gayle opens the face to point"
7.6,"Harbhajan to Rahul, OUT","after all the bad balls they have punished, Kings XI end up losing a wicket to a full toss. Wicket or boundary, it's almost as if CSK can't manage a delivery that doesn't make you flinch. Rahul punches it uppishly as he throws his weight behind the shot and finds DJ Bravo who leaps at cover to hold on to a sharp catch"
7.5,"Harbhajan to Gayle, 1 run","full on the stumps, quietly pushed down to long-on"
7.4,"Harbhajan to Rahul, 1 run","slides it into the pads, and Rahul uses the angle and spin to tuck behind square"
7.3,"Harbhajan to Rahul, no run","flattens the trajectory and fires a length ball around off, pushed back"
7.2,"Harbhajan to Gayle, 1 run","non-turning length ball, pretty wide outside off, Gayle punches it through point"
7.1,"Harbhajan to Rahul, 1 run","length, spinning into middle, punched down to long-on"
6.6,"Tahir to Gayle, SIX runs","straight down the ground again. Tahir slides this into Gayle's leg stump, and he gets the front leg out and pummels it for six more"
6.5,"Tahir to Gayle, no run","stays in the crease and opens the face, gets beaten"
6.4,"Tahir to Gayle, FOUR runs","brute force! And a fifty for Gayle, off 22 balls. That's as emphatic a franchise debut as there can be. A flighted fuller one on the stumps, and Gayle hammers it straight over"
6.3,"Tahir to Rahul, 1 run","pitched up on middle and leg, driven down to long-on"
6.2,"Tahir to Rahul, 2 runs","short, wide, rocks back and cuts through point. Pulled back in front of the boundary"
6.1,"Tahir to Rahul, FOUR runs","Tahir continues the trend of horrible deliveries, a full toss on leg stump, and Rahul flicks it to deep midwicket"
5.6,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","there, much better! More of that. A yorker to end the over, and Gayle digs it out to cover"
5.5,"Chahar to Gayle, SIX runs","length ball, as harmless as they come, well outside off, carted over long-off"
5.5,"Chahar to Gayle, 1 wide","some more short stuff, this one's too high for the batsman to be able to punish it, and that means he gets to face another delivery"
5.4,"Chahar to Gayle, FOUR runs","another shortish one, and ample of room. Jeez, when will they start bowling closer at the stumps. Gayle barely has to get the front foot away to slap it through long-off"
5.3,"Chahar to Gayle, FOUR runs","slower short ball, Gayle swivels and helps it along to square leg. He jogs the first as two fielders converge, and that's fine because neither man can get to it"
5.2,"Chahar to Gayle, SIX runs","a length ball that nicely sits up for him outside off, around the fifth or sixth-stump line, and Gayle mows it over long-on with a clean swing of the arms"
5.1,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","full on middle and leg, flicked to midwicket"
4.6,"Thakur to Gayle, FOUR runs","that's some more tripe. Another shortish delivery, they aren't learning anything from their mistakes, Gayle doesn't entirely time it but the big swing is enough to carry it just past the mid-on fielder running back and sliding in front of the boundary"
4.5,"Thakur to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, punched through the covers"
4.4,"Thakur to Rahul, FOUR runs","CSK are putting on an exhibition of everything you shouldn't bowl in a T20 game. After a full one on the pads, he drops short to Rahul, at a gentle pace, as he shifts back and swivels into a powerful pull through midwicket"
4.3,"Thakur to Gayle, 1 run",sprays one into the pads of Gayle who flicks to midwicket
4.2,"Thakur to Gayle, no run","full and wide, big swing and a miss as he is stapled to the crease"
4.1,"Thakur to Gayle, FOUR runs","edged and through the gap between keeper and wide slip. That's an unusually wide slip, probably even wider of where second slip would have been. That means Gayle can take liberties at throwing his hands at deliveries that are well outside his reach"
3.6,"Harbhajan to Rahul, FOUR runs",now he finds the gap past that fielder. This is terrific batting. Steps down the track and gets right to the pitch before lacing a drive through the left of the extra cover fielder. Top shot
3.5,"Harbhajan to Rahul, no run",steps out to one that drifts into him and goes slightly inside-out to extra cover
3.4,"Harbhajan to Rahul, FOUR runs","this is some tripe! No control from Harbhajan, he's spraying it all around. This one's a full toss around off and Rahul punches it through the covers with ease"
3.3,"Harbhajan to Gayle, 1 run","leg-side line again, he needs to settle into something here, Gayle waits and tucks it behind square for one"
3.2,"Harbhajan to Gayle, SIX runs",now he overcompensates with the line and floats up a fuller one that spins away to give Gayle all the room he wants to shovel it over long-off
3.1,"Harbhajan to Gayle, FOUR runs","shortish, slower through the air and zero turn outside off, Gayle rocks back and flays a cut to the left of point"
2.6,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","switches over to an off-stump line for this back of a length delivery, Rahul chops a punch towards extra cover"
2.5,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","short and banged into his leg stump, and all that leaves Rahul to do is to help it along to deep backward square leg"
2.4,"Chahar to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length on off, and a rare quick single from Gayle as he drops it to the left of point and takes off"
2.3,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","full, angled across, a wide yorker, but this time it curves in slightly and pretty late too to have Gayle hitting the ground as he brings the bat down"
2.2,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","extremely full outside off, shapes away and sneaks underneath as Gayle jams the bat down"
2.1,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","ah, has he got away with that? Seemed to drift a long way from the left-hander, nowhere near Gayle's reach, but for some reason, the umpire thought that was fine"
1.6,"Harbhajan to Rahul, no run",steps down the track but it's a shorter length and that forces Rahul to resort to a mild push back to the bowler
1.5,"Harbhajan to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length, turns away from middle and off, Gayle waits on the backfoot before turning it away to midwicket"
1.4,"Harbhajan to Gayle, no run","length ball outside off, lets it turn before gently tapping it to point"
1.3,"Harbhajan to Gayle, no run",comes down the track and pats it away against the turn towards mid-on
1.2,"Harbhajan to Gayle, no run","fullish length, looped up around off, defended back"
1.1,"Harbhajan to Gayle, FOUR runs","a nice flighted delivery outside off, and Gayle responds with a languid drive through the covers. Good stride forward and neatly splits the field"
0.6,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","ah, shot! The aesthetic value of that is just unbelievable. Rahul simply leans into a punch through the covers, in the process covering for the late movement and using the pace to his advantage as he throws his weight behind it"
0.5,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","ah, jeez, Rahul's been hit on the box attempting a pull. Gets really cramped up for room and the ball bounces off after hitting him there to graze the midriff. Painful"
0.4,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","full and shaping away late outside off, Rahul swings and the ball sneaks past the inside edge"
0.3,"Chahar to Rahul, 2 runs","fullish, angled in at middle and leg and straightening, Rahul drills off the inside of the bat to backward square leg"
0.2,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","now that swing works to Rahul's favour as it gives him the room he needs to open up his arms, an imperious punch over the extra cover region"
0.1,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","some shape right away. A length ball, angled in and straightening on off, defended"
19.6,"Laughlin to Mandeep, no run",swing and a miss. Beaten by this slower delivery that drifted away.  Rajasthan have defended a score for a second time this season. 
19.5,"Laughlin to Mandeep, 2 runs","makes room and drives inside out to deep extra cover, Mandeep scampers back. Can Mandeep get to his half-century? He's played beautifully."
19.4,"Laughlin to Mandeep, FOUR runs","stunning straight drive. Too full, he backed away and hammered this. Straight as an arrow. Long-on and long-off came around but had no chance."
19.3,"Laughlin to Mandeep, FOUR runs",thick outside edge that beats short third man. Looks to slice this behind point but the ball dips and takes the edge.
19.2,"Laughlin to Mandeep, FOUR runs",walks across the stumps and simply helps this slower bouncer over short fine leg. Easily done
19.1,"Laughlin to Mandeep, 2 runs","drilled down the ground, Gowtham comes around to stop that at long-off."
18.6,"Stokes to Woakes, no run",plays and misses a full toss outside off.
18.5,"Stokes to Sundar, OUT",paddles this full toss onto the middle stump. Went far too across and deflected it back. Wanted to go over the keeper's head. He's played a lovely innings though.
18.4,"Stokes to Sundar, 2 runs","full and straight on middle, he backs away and drills this between long-on and long-off"
18.3,"Stokes to Sundar, no run","angles this short of length delivery across, Washington looks to back away and slash but is beaten"
18.2,"Stokes to Sundar, SIX runs","lofted cleanly over extra cover. Slower and fuller outside off, he backed away and belted this without a trace of worry."
18.1,"Stokes to Sundar, FOUR runs","carved away over backward point. Lovely from Washington, making a case as a batsman too. Amidst his new ball ability, it's conveniently forgotten that he plays in the top order for his state side Tamil Nadu"
17.6,"Laughlin to Sundar, 1 run","slower bouncer, pulled over square leg, lands short of the man coming in from the deep."
17.5,"Laughlin to Sundar, 2 runs",backs away and belts this full delivery to Stokes at wide long-off. A misfield gives them an opportunity to take the second
17.4,"Laughlin to Sundar, SIX runs","tipped over the long-on boundary by Gowtham. This was a short-arm jab and the ball flew off the blade. Had he been right at the ropes, this could've been an easier catch"
17.3,"Laughlin to Mandeep, 1 run","right into the blockhole, squeezed to point. Superb from Laughlin"
17.2,"Laughlin to Mandeep, 2 runs","goes over cover, gets this into the gap. Wide long-off and deep cover converge to cut that off"
17.1,"Laughlin to Sundar, 1 run","slower and fuller outside off, squeezed to deep cover"
16.6,"Unadkat to Mandeep, no run","walks across to flick, ends up yorking himself."
16.5,"Unadkat to Mandeep, 2 runs","this one's lofted over cover, down to the boundary rider. Gowtham had 10 yards or so to move to his left, back comfortably for the second"
16.4,"Unadkat to Mandeep, FOUR runs","reaches out to carve this yorker-length delivery outside off to beat square third man. Handy runs these for RCB, all it's doing is reducing the margin of defeat though"
16.3,"Unadkat to Mandeep, FOUR runs",backs away and slices this cut to pick the gap behind point. Lovely timing.
16.2,"Unadkat to Sundar, 1 run",plays a short-arm jab towards deep midwicket
16.1,"Unadkat to Sundar, SIX runs","this is too short and angling in, Washington stays inside the crease and slaps this over long-on. That should give him some batting confidence"
15.6,"Stokes to Sundar, 3 runs","mistimed hoick from way outside off towards deep midwicket. Short lost control of the ball as he turned to throw, and ended up kicking it towards long-on. Then, he had to run around to pick the ball and throw."
15.5,"Stokes to Sundar, no run","through with the swing again, failed to account for the slower delivery"
15.4,"Stokes to Sundar, no run","another swing, another miss. This time Stokes angled it full from around the stumps, Washington looked to hit this over long-on"
15.3,"Stokes to Sundar, no run","swing and a miss. Slower length ball outside off, beaten."
15.2,"Stokes to Mandeep, 1 leg bye","swung through way too early, this ball angled back in to deflect off the pad and roll towards short third man"
15.1,"Stokes to Sundar, 1 run","makes room and punches this to wide mid-off, good stop."
15.1,"Stokes to Sundar, 1 wide",slants this way outside off. Saw the batsman making room but bowled it really wide
14.6,"Laughlin to Sundar, 1 run","looks to work this against the line, gets a thick inside edge onto the boot, ball deflects to the off side for a single"
14.5,"Laughlin to Sundar, no run","slower length ball that hits a patch and just takes off, Washington knocked on the glove as he defends"
14.5,"Laughlin to Sundar, 1 wide","gets the line wrong, way down leg. Good take by Buttler"
14.4,"Laughlin to Mandeep, 1 run",pulled on the bounce to Samson at deep square leg
14.3,"Laughlin to Mandeep, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off, Mandeep carves this behind point. Nice hands, nice reach, sublime timing"
14.2,"Laughlin to Sundar, 1 run",chips this drive down to sweeper cover to get off the mark
14.1,"Laughlin to Negi, OUT","strikes, Buttler has finally taken a catch. This is slower and fuller outside off, Negi looks to work this to the leg side, but gets a thick edge as it cuts away late and this is well taken by Buttler diving to his left."
13.6,"Gowtham to Mandeep, no run",shapes to pull but the ball skids back in to hit the flap of the pad as Mandeep is through with the stroke early. That was bowled at 103kph
13.5,"Gowtham to Negi, 1 run",goes back deep into the crease and whips this down to deep midwicket
13.4,"Gowtham to Mandeep, 1 run","pushed through quicker at length outside off, dabbed towards point"
13.3,"Gowtham to Negi, 1 run","skids back in from around the stumps, pulls towards deep square"
13.2,"Gowtham to Mandeep, 1 run","too short, he rocks back and slashes to deep point"
13.1,"Gowtham to Mandeep, SIX runs","he's clobbered this way over long-on. Is there life in the game? Too much flight, got underneath it and gave it some muscle"
12.6,"Gopal to Mandeep, 1 run","mistimes the pull that he looks to fetch from way outside off, lands between deep midwicket and wide long-on"
12.5,"Gopal to Mandeep, no run",beaten by sharp turn. Looks to lunge forward and jab. Lovely from Shreyas
12.4,"Gopal to Negi, 1 run","squeezes this flick to square leg, off the mark"
12.3,"Gopal to AB, OUT","first he takes out Kohli and now has AB. Absolute half-tracker down leg, AB rocks back and pulls this straight to deep square leg. Unadkat takes an excellent low catch."
12.2,"Gopal to AB, no run",this one keeps low to beat the underedge as he looked to punch
12.1,"Gopal to AB, no run","slow turn from length on off stump, AB defends. Took his bottom hand off the grip"
11.6,"Unadkat to AB, 1 run","steps out and lofts this over the infield, down to long-on. Far from off the middle. AB's struggling for timing just a touch tonight again"
11.5,"Unadkat to AB, FOUR runs","slices this into the gap between backward point and short third man. Not much pace on this, AB went hard at it, just about managed to find the gap."
11.4,"Unadkat to Mandeep, 1 run","skiddy length ball on middle and off, he wrists this down towards deep midwicket"
11.3,"Unadkat to AB, 1 run",makes room and punches this down to long-off. Can't get the kind of room he would've liked. That's three good deliveries so far from Unadkat
11.2,"Unadkat to Mandeep, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, eased down to third man"
11.1,"Unadkat to AB, 1 run",makes room and punches this length delivery to deep cover

10.5,"Gopal to Mandeep, 1 run",punches this length delivery into the deep extra cover region
10.4,"Gopal to AB, 1 run","fired full on the pads, worked down to long on"
10.3,"Gopal to Mandeep, 1 run",eased with the spin to long-off
10.2,"Gopal to Kohli, OUT",pulled to Short who times his jump to perfection to take this leaping catch at deep midwicket. Is this the catch that turns it? Local boy Shreyas has silenced the Bengaluru crowd as he does a lap.
10.1,"Gopal to AB, 1 run","shapes to sweep but Shreyas bowls this full and way outside off, eased to long-off"
9.6,"Laughlin to AB, 1 run",walks across the stumps and wrists this full delivery down to long on
9.5,"Laughlin to AB, SIX runs","he's sliced this over deep extra cover, seemed a mishit but boy, this has carried all the way."
9.4,"Laughlin to AB, no run","squeezes out this yorker to cover, superb bowling this. Excellent execution"
9.3,"Laughlin to Kohli, 1 run",walks across and whips this on the bounce to deep midwicket
9.2,"Laughlin to Kohli, no run",steps out but gets yorked nearly as this tails in a long way. AB was more than halfway down the pitch when he was sent back but Buttler doesn't pick up the ball cleanly. Run-out chance missed.
9.1,"Laughlin to AB, 1 run",walks across the stumps and whips this cutter towards deep midwicket
8.6,"Gopal to Kohli, SIX runs",short and put away. Kohli rocks back and muscles this pull over deep midwicket. That's adding insult to injury.
8.5,"Gopal to AB, 1 bye"," stumping chance missed!  Oh, dear. Is that the turning point? AB is foxed by a googly that spins back in to beat the inside edge as he stepped out to go over the top. What's worse is the slip fielder's throw at the stumps resulted in an overthrow."
8.4,"Gopal to AB, no run","turns this back to the bowler, cramped for room."
8.3,"Gopal to AB, 2 runs","walks across the stumps and sweeps this firmly into the gap at deep square. Short does well to get to the ball and cut that off, saved two runs"
8.2,"Gopal to AB, no run","spins back in, defended to the leg side. Sharp turn"
8.1,"Gopal to Kohli, 1 run",works this down to long-on to bring up his 26-ball 50.  This is his fastest in IPL history 
7.6,"Short to de Kock, OUT","he's pulled this straight to Unadkat at deep backward square leg. This kept a touch low but was asking to be hit, De Kock did just that but didn't hit this off the middle. As easy as catches come. So a half-tracker has fetched a wicket. Incredibly, a wicket has fallen and Chinnaswamy roars because AB de Villiers is striding out to the middle."
7.5,"Short to Kohli, 1 run","spins back in from leg stump, worked to deep square leg"
7.4,"Short to de Kock, 1 run",eased with the spin to sweeper cover
7.3,"Short to Kohli, 1 run",pulled from outside off towards deep midwicket
7.2,"Short to Kohli, SIX runs","the bottom hand comes off the blade as he goes down on one knee to slog, still clears long-on. Wow, this is a very cruel game to the bowlers, especially here at the Chinnaswamy"
7.1,"Short to de Kock, 1 run","sliding down leg, he rocks back and pulls to deep backward square leg"
6.6,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 run",lucky to get away with that tripe delivery. De Kock rocks back and pulls this to deep midwicket
6.5,"Gopal to Kohli, 1 run",works this from length outside off towards deep midwicket
6.4,"Gopal to Kohli, no run","deceived by the googly, Kohli plays for the legspin but this one hits him on the pad. Caught on the crease, but this was sliding down"
6.3,"Gopal to Kohli, FOUR runs","pulled to bisect deep midwicket and deep square. Too easy, can't bowl there. Asking for trouble"
6.2,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 bye","has he put that down? Surely, yes.  Dropped by Buttler.  Shaped to cut but got a thick outside edge, deflects to short third man. Given as a bye, so doesn't go down as a dropped chance"
6.1,"Gopal to de Kock, no run","slides one across De Kock, who flat-bats this back to the bowler"
5.6,"Stokes to Kohli, 2 runs",walks out and steers this low full toss into the gap at deep point
5.6,"Stokes to Kohli, 1 wide","slower ball gone wrong, slides this down leg even as Kohli walks out to flick. Pressure on Stokes"
5.5,"Stokes to Kohli, FOUR runs","full toss outside off, Kohli opens the bat face to slice this drive on the bounce over point."
5.4,"Stokes to Kohli, 2 runs","chips this flick shot into the gap at midwicket, down towards Gowtham. Can't prevent the second though"
5.3,"Stokes to de Kock, 1 run","slower and fuller outside off, squeezed to extra cover"
5.2,"Stokes to Kohli, 1 run",walks across the stumps and flicks this full delivery to deep square leg
5.1,"Stokes to Kohli, FOUR runs",he's welcomed with a fierce pull that leaves midwicket with no chance. Kohli wallops that a couple of bounces into the ropes.
4.6,"Gowtham to de Kock, no run",makes room and hits this length ball straight to extra cover
4.5,"Gowtham to de Kock, FOUR runs","swept fiercely, beats square leg. Fetched this from off stump. This wasn't all that bad a delivery from Gowtham, take your hat off to de Kock for being brave and risking being lbw to play that"
4.4,"Gowtham to de Kock, FOUR runs","clean strike. Stepped out, moved to the leg side and lofted this inside-out one bounce to the wide long-off fence"
4.3,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run",whips this length ball to deep midwicket. This skid through and cramped him for room
4.2,"Gowtham to de Kock, 1 run","grip and turn from middle, de Kock gets a leading edge towards point"
4.1,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run",whips this down to long on
3.6,"Unadkat to Kohli, 1 run",defends this length ball into the off side towards cover for a quick single
3.5,"Unadkat to de Kock, 1 run",bunts this length ball towards point as they scamper a run. De Kock looked to go over cover but the bowler cramped him for room and so he had to readjust
3.4,"Unadkat to de Kock, no run",makes room and squeezes out this yorker-length delivery to mid-off
3.3,"Unadkat to de Kock, FOUR runs",drilled down the ground past the diving mid-on fielder. Too full and QDK was waiting for it
3.2,"Unadkat to de Kock, 2 runs",on the pads and he's clipped that into the gap at deep midwicket. Short comes around to cut that off
3.1,"Unadkat to Kohli, 1 run","slower and fuller on off, eased towards point"
2.6,"Gowtham to de Kock, FOUR runs","makes room and punches this length ball through extra cover, Stokes was after it but the ball kept gathering pace as it raced off the turf."

2.4,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run",works this with the spin to long on
2.3,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run",works this flatter length ball to midwicket
2.2,"Gowtham to Kohli, FOUR runs","slaps this through cover. Too short, he rocked back and used the width to crash that into the gap."
2.1,"Gowtham to de Kock, 1 run","drifts in a low full toss, driven to wide mid-off"
1.6,"Kulkarni to de Kock, 1 run",tucks this slower delivery to short fine leg where Unadkat dives to keep it to a single
1.5,"Kulkarni to Kohli, 1 run","slower and fuller on off, turned towards mid-on for a quick single"
1.4,"Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR runs","this is magnificent! This time, the same length ball on off but goes over midwicket. Walked across the stumps and allowed those wrists to take over as he whipped this away."
1.3,"Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR runs","slapped disdainfully over cover. Just made a hint of room and put that away without much fuss. Nothing wrong with the delivery, really."
1.2,"Kulkarni to Kohli, no run",walks outside the crease and bunts this length delivery to cover again
1.1,"Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR runs","crunching cover drive. Length outside off, Kohli walks into the stroke and bisects cover and mid-off. All class and quality"
0.6,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run",works this from outside off towards wide long on
0.5,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run","spins back in to strike the pad, but this was sliding down leg. Kohli was looking to work this to the leg side"
0.4,"Gowtham to McCullum, OUT",rocks back and hammers this pull straight to Stokes at deep midwicket. This was hammered but it was almost as if McCullum didn't know there was a man there. Stokes made it look ridiculously easy. Timed his jump superbly and was airborne when it lodged in his bucket hands.
0.3,"Gowtham to McCullum, no run","flatter one at length on middle, turned to square leg again"
0.2,"Gowtham to McCullum, no run",turns this gently with the spin to square leg
0.1,"Gowtham to McCullum, FOUR runs","slapped away, a misfield at cover means there's a boundary. Should've been a dot. Oh, dear. The fielder? Sanju Samson"
19.6,"Yadav to Samson, 1 run","low full toss outside off, squeezes this to cover. Samson walks off to applause and appreciation from RCB. Stunning knock."
19.5,"Yadav to Samson, SIX runs",he's hitting them on demand. Samson has picked this full delivery outside off over long-off. Just made a bit of room and laced this over.
19.4,"Yadav to Samson, SIX runs","clean strike over the bowler's head, just eludes a leaping McCullum at long-off. Can't go length at this stage of the innings."
19.4,"Yadav to Tripathi, (no ball) 1 run","slower length ball on middle, Tripathi backs away and pulls to deep midwicket.  Oh, dear. Umesh has overstepped.  Samson on strike. Kohli is furious. That was a massive no-ball too"
19.3,"Yadav to Tripathi, FOUR runs","too short and he's pulled this into the deep midwicket boundary. Tripe bowling from Umesh. Superb the other night, very ordinary here"
19.2,"Yadav to Tripathi, SIX runs","he's picked the bones out of that. Slower and fuller on middle, he backed away and belted that to the second tier in the member's stand. Wow, massive hit"

18.6,"Woakes to Samson, FOUR runs","goes over cover, beats the sweeper Negi. Bounces into the ropes. Don't think he would've been too disappointed by a single either."
18.5,"Woakes to Samson, FOUR runs","deflected past the keeper. That's his first boundary, would you believe it? Yorker length outside off, he brings his bat down at an angle to run it down."
18.4,"Woakes to Samson, SIX runs","at the moment, he's dealing in just sixes. This slower ball is bowled at length, Samson backs away and lofts this through the line to clear long on"

18.2,"Woakes to Buttler, OUT","right into the blockhole, he's toe-ended a lofted hit straight to mid-off. The muted celebrations in the RCB camp tell you a story. When was the last time you saw Kohli take a catch and quietly and lob the ball back to the umpire?"
18.1,"Woakes to Buttler, 2 runs",slices this full toss towards deep point
17.6,"Khejroliya to Samson, SIX runs","another one, a similar result. This one's even bigger, into the second tier. Khejroliya delivers another half-volley and Samson had the room to loft this cleanly."
17.5,"Khejroliya to Samson, SIX runs","excellent from Samson. He backs away and lofts this full delivery cleanly over long-off. The left foot went towards mid-on to create room. Khejroliya went for a yorker, missed his length and got punished"
17.4,"Khejroliya to Buttler, 1 run",backs away and drills this low full toss to sweeper cover
17.3,"Khejroliya to Samson, 1 run","nice and full on the stumps, squeezed to long on"
17.2,"Khejroliya to Samson, 2 runs",heaves and gets a thick inside edge towards deep midwicket
17.1,"Khejroliya to Samson, no run",backs away to slap this over point but misses this high full toss. Keeper put his gloves out to stop that. Wasn't far from being over the waist
16.6,"Woakes to Buttler, SIX runs",backs away and deposits this length ball into the second tier at midwicket. Very predictable there from Woakes
16.5,"Woakes to Samson, 1 run","right into the blockhole, dug out in time, the ball rolls towards point.  First half-century in three games for Samson "
16.4,"Woakes to Buttler, 1 run",backs away and squeezes this yorker to deep cover where Negi comes around to cut that off

16.1,"Woakes to Samson, no run","right into the blockhole, kept out. Superb start"
15.6,"Yadav to Samson, 1 run","slants this one into middle and leg, tucked to square leg. A direct hit at the bowler's end from Chahal and Samson would've been gone."

15.4,"Yadav to Buttler, 2 runs","slants this full delivery into the pads, flicked into the gap between deep midwicket and wide long-on"

15.2,"Yadav to Samson, no run",lovely little flick with the angle towards square leg
15.1,"Yadav to Samson, SIX runs",whips thsi full toss over deep midwicket. Enough wood to just clear Mandeep there. Not sure he got this off the middle
15.1,"Yadav to Samson, (no ball)","now a beamer, down leg. Surely a warning. Yes, called no-ball and a free-hit"
15.1,"Yadav to Samson, 1 wide","slips this full ball way down leg, good take by QdK"

14.4,"Chahal to Buttler, no run","reverse-swept to point, played a touch too early and gave away his intentions"

14.1,"Chahal to Samson, no run",makes room and punches this to Umesh at point

13.4,"Negi to Samson, 1 run",eased with the spin to long off

13.2,"Negi to Samson, no run",drifts in to squeeze off an inside edge back to Negi
13.1,"Negi to Samson, 2 runs","clean inside-out strike over the infield, down to sweeper cover. Got more elevation this time, safe however."
12.6,"Chahal to Buttler, 4 byes","goes outside off to paddle, but the ball spins away to beat the edge, keeper and sip fielder too were fooled by that. Perhaps they didn't pick this at all. Four byes it is"
12.5,"Chahal to Samson, 1 run",thick outside edge to short third man as he shapes to cut
12.4,"Chahal to Buttler, 1 run","drifting into middle and leg, tucked to square leg"
12.3,"Chahal to Buttler, FOUR runs","begins with a reverse sweep for four. Fired in but outside off, he changed his bat grip quickly to put that low full toss away past the diving backward point fielder"
12.2,"Chahal to Stokes, OUT","he's dragged this back onto the stumps. Went for a big mow over deep square, had to fetch it from way outside off. Ended up getting a thick inside edge onto the stumps."

11.6,"Khejroliya to Stokes, 2 runs","full toss sliding down leg, tickled down to fine leg where Woakes covers good ground to effect a tumbling stop, saved two runs for the side"
11.6,"Khejroliya to Stokes, 1 wide","slants this full delivery down leg, will have to rebowl that"
11.5,"Khejroliya to Samson, 1 run"," Works this length ball from outside off towards midwicket, a direct hit at the bowler's end and  Samson would've been gone "
11.4,"Khejroliya to Stokes, 1 run","skiddy length ball on middle, tucked to square leg"
11.3,"Khejroliya to Stokes, SIX runs","helped into the stands at fine leg. Too short and angling in, Stokes was waiting for it as he swiveled back and used the pace to wallop that deep"
11.2,"Khejroliya to Stokes, FOUR runs",splits the gap between short third man and point. Used the width to good effect. Opened the bat face slightly to pick the gap. Lovely.

10.6,"Sundar to Stokes, 1 run","drifting into middle and leg, tucked with the angle to deep square. End of a neat, little spell from Washington."

10.4,"Sundar to Stokes, 1 run","once again makes room to go over the off side, but Washington fires this in. Punched down towards mid-off. Superb bowling this."

10.2,"Sundar to Samson, 1 run","flatter on off, turned with the spin to long on again"
10.1,"Sundar to Samson, SIX runs","clears long on effortlessly. Just hit that length ball through the line, so much power off the bottomhand. Stunning from Samson"
9.6,"Yadav to Stokes, FOUR runs","whips this from outside off towards midwicket, and boy, he's picked the gap. Sensational. So much punch in the stroke. Deep square leg had no chance"

9.4,"Yadav to Stokes, no run",steps out to belt this over mid-off but ends up hitting it flat and off the-end on the bounce to Kohli there

7.2,"Khejroliya to Stokes, 1 run","short of length on off, Stokes through the short-arm jab too early, gets some bat off the edge as this rolls wide of the keeper on the off side"

6.6,"Chahal to Stokes, 1 leg bye","turns this towards short fine leg, off the mark? Not yet, given as leg bye"
6.5,"Chahal to Short, OUT","Guess what? He's not run out, but has to go. Chahal pushes this through, gets this to drift away, there's a hint of sidespin as well. Short shapes to cut but has no room and gets the toe end of the bat as de Kock takes an excellent catch."

6.3,"Chahal to Samson, 1 run","flatter one on middle, punched to long on"

5.5,"Woakes to Short, 1 wide","floats this full but down leg, Short looks to flick but misses."
5.4,"Woakes to Rahane, OUT","he's not hit this well and has paid the price, straight to mid-on. This was another slower delivery from Woakes, full but way outside off, Rahane looked to hit this straight but ended up dragging it off the toe end. He's done his job though.  There was intent right from the outset."
5.3,"Woakes to Rahane, FOUR runs","this is just helped on its way over deep backward square. Stunning shot. Too slow and drifting down, this was almost as if Rahane was waiting for it as he swung through with the angle."
5.2,"Woakes to Short, 1 run",pulled away towards deep square where  Mandeep Singh  puts off a stunning dive to save three runs. Covered ground quickly and then dived full stretch to effect a one-handed stop.
5.1,"Woakes to Rahane, 1 run",slaps this short of length delivery to sweeper cover
4.6,"Chahal to Short, FOUR runs",clean strike over the bowler's head. Too full and Short's eyes lit up as he belted this away

4.1,"Chahal to Short, 1 run",worked with the spin to deep midwicket
3.6,"Yadav to Rahane, FOUR runs","hoicked away again, the midwicket boundary has been peppered again. Take that, he says. Rahane has come out looking to play a different game"

2.6,"Sundar to Rahane, 1 run",works this length ball into the midwicket region

1.6,"Woakes to Rahane, no run","slices this slower delivery down to short third man, brief mix-up, again! They don't take the run. D'Arcy Short can breathe a sign of relief"
1.5,"Woakes to Short, 1 run",slower delivery that he bunts into the off side towards point for a quick single
1.4,"Woakes to Short, no run","slash and a miss. Went for an expansive cut, without any feet movement. Woakes lucky to get away with that"

1.2,"Woakes to Rahane, FOUR runs","picks the length early and slaps this over midwicket, one bounce to the ropes. Just a touch too short from Woakes"
1.1,"Woakes to Rahane, no run",looks to work this off his hip but is beaten as this thuds into his thigh pad

18.6,"Russell to Pathan, SIX runs","ends with a six! Short on off, and Yusuf pulls it away. Top-edged, but enough power behind the big man to take it over the boundary behind square. Sunrisers Hyderabad win in Kolkata for the first time ever!"

18.4,"Russell to Pathan, 1 run",yorker just outside off. Dug away towards the leg side for a quick single. Sunrisers need seven off eight
18.3,"Russell to Pathan, FOUR runs","good length on off, and that's been punched off the back foot. Lynn's at cover, but the ball just goes over his head. Pathan's lucky but he'll take the boundary"

15.5,"Chawla to Shakib, OUT","breaks leg stump! Good length on leg, but Shakib's caught in two minds. Chooses to defend eventually, but the ball sneaks through between bat and pad. This game's not over yet, folks! But for now it's the time out"

0.1,"Johnson to Saha, no run","good length on off stump, defended"
0.1,"Johnson to Saha, 1 wide","good length on off, and angling across Saha. Left alone by the batsman, and slightly unlucky that the umpire calls it a wide. It was well inside the tramlines"
19.6,"Kaul to Shivam Mavi, OUT","overpitched, but wide outside off. Too far for Mavi, but he manages to stick his bat out. Takes the toe end, and top-edges it behind the keeper. Bhuvneshwar and Stanlake both try to take the catch, and the Indian gets there first. Does well to ensure he doesn't crash into big Billy S. KKR finish on 138 for 8"
19.5,"Kaul to Shivam Mavi, no run","good length on off, and angling into Mavi. Tries to play the uppercut but nowhere near that shot"
19.4,"Kaul to Johnson, 1 run",full on middle and Johnson manages to bunt it to long off
19.3,"Kaul to Johnson, no run","full outside off, and Johnson's wild swing doesn't connect. Goes under his bat and through to the keeper"

19.1,"Kaul to Shivam Mavi, 2 runs","full on off, and muscled inside out over cover. Dhawan at wide long off has to run to his left, but manages to parry this back into play"
18.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Johnson, 2 runs","good length on off, and Johnson tries to pull towards cow corner. Takes the top edge, but lands just short of Stanlake at third man. Finishes with 3 for 26"
18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Shivam Mavi, 1 run","full on off, and Mavi drags this towards the leg side. Manages to muscle this towards long on"
18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Johnson, (no ball) 1 run","caught, but no ball! Full on off, and Johnson backed away to free his arms. Hit it towards cover, but slices it into the air. KW takes the catch, and even starts celebrating, before Bhuvi tells him about the no ball. Free hit"
18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Johnson, no run","good length on off stump, but angling across the batsman. Tries to carve it towards point, but goes past the outside edge and through to the keeper. Bhuvi wants to review, but they're out of reviews."
18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, OUT","edged! Full outside off, and Karthik's drive away from his body takes the outside edge. Pocketed by Saha moving to his right"
18.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, no run",slower ball that DK can't connect with. Good length on off but takes ages to get to the batsman. Misses the late cut
18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, SIX runs","knuckle ball on off, but Karthik's spotted the length early. Big stride forward and muscled over the bowler's head. Lands beyond the sightscreen. Full use of the free hit!"
18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, (no ball)","full outside off, and DK hits it over Bhuvneshwar's head. Off the bat's toe end and falls in front of long off. Oh dear, front-foot no-ball too. Free hit"
17.6,"Rashid Khan to Shivam Mavi, 2 runs","full on middle stump, and Mavi's sweep goes to short fine leg. Rashid appeals for the lbw, but the umpire thinks it's bat first. Williamson reviews.. Replays show glove first"
17.5,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 1 run","full on off, and he sweeps behind square to fine leg. Had to drag it from outside off eventually"
17.4,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, FOUR runs","delicately played! Good length on off, and DK sticks his bat out to cut it super late. Beats short third man and races away for four"
17.3,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, no run","misses the outside edge! Full on off stump, but it's the flipper this time. Zips on after pitching, and DK defends down the wrong line. Smartly taken by the keeper"
17.2,"Rashid Khan to Shivam Mavi, 1 run","full on leg stump, and going straight through. Takes the batsman's pads, and trickles down to short fine leg"
17.1,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 1 run","delicate, but only a single. Full on off, and he reverse paddles it to short third man"
16.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Shivam Mavi, no run","good length on off stump, and too close to Mavi for the cut. Almost takes the bat's edge but eventually safe through to the keeper"

16.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, OUT","soft dismissal! Good length outside off, and swinging away from Gill. He tries to muscle this over the infield, but takes the top edge. Shakib - at cover - takes a few steps back and completes the catch from near his face. Bhuvi's knuckleball earns him a wicket"
16.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, no run","full, but wide outside off. Gill tries to drive towards the off side again, but comes off the bat's inside half. Hit to midwicket"
16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, no run","full outside off, and driven away from his body. Not timed well, and easily stopped by cover"
16.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, 1 run","starts off with the slower ball. Short on middle, and DK flicks it fine off his pads. Goes to fine leg this time"
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 1 run","good length on middle, and it's pulled off the back foot to deep midwicket. He'll keep strike"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and Gill turns it off his pads to fine leg"
15.4,"Rashid Khan to Gill, no run","full just outside off. Defended off the front foot towards cover. Slightly slower this time, meaning more revs on that delivery"
15.3,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 1 run","full on leg stump, and DK misses the defense. Hits his pad, and the ball goes to the leg side for a run. The umpire says bat first"

14.4,"Kaul to Karthik, 1 run","full on off stump, and his drive takes the outside edge. Goes to third man, where Stanlake is positioned"
14.3,"Kaul to Karthik, no run",full just outside off. Driven down the ground to mid off
14.2,"Kaul to Karthik, FOUR runs","good length outside off, but DK rides the bounce to punch this with the bat's open face. Beats point, and third man can't cut it off either"

13.6,"Stanlake to Gill, no run","short outside off, and Gill tries to cut it over the slip cordon. Too high and through to Saha. Time out again"
13.5,"Stanlake to Gill, no run","good length on off stump, and blocked off the back foot. Played to point"

13.3,"Stanlake to Karthik, no run",back of a length and just outside off. Fended off the back foot with soft hands
13.2,"Stanlake to Russell, OUT","Poor from Russell. Full outside off, and Dre Russ slaps this over point once again. Slices it this time, and Pandey - at point - runs towards the boundary to complete an excellent diving catch! Slides across the ground after pocketing that. Pandey's been electric today"
13.1,"Stanlake to Russell, SIX runs","Full outside off, and Russell slaps this over point. Hooda races to his left and sticks his hand out, and even throws the ball in, but his back leg is hitting the boundary"
12.6,"Shakib to Karthik, no run","good length on middle, and angling into his pads. Tries to flick square, but hits his pad instead"
12.5,"Shakib to Russell, 1 run","full on off, and driven with the turn down to wide long on"
12.4,"Shakib to Russell, no run","tossed up on off stump, but Russell's not biting the apple. Defended off the front foot"
12.3,"Shakib to Russell, 2 runs","darts it into Russell's pads, and he flicks towards deep backward square. Could've easily gone to the man at short leg too"
12.2,"Shakib to Lynn, OUT","falls for 49! Good length on middle, and Lynn punches this too soon. The ball stuck up after pitching, forcing the error from Lynn, and Shakib dives to his left to take a one-handed stunner"

11.6,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, 1 run","good length, just outside off. Turns it towards the leg side with soft hands. Played in the gap, which allows DK to take the single. Rashid has to go chasing after it"

11.4,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run",back of a length on middle stump. Lynn goes deep onto the back foot and muscles it to midwicket

10.4,"Shakib to Narine, OUT","KW to the rescue! Good length outside off, and the arm ball does the trick. Narine swings through the line of the ball, but not off the meat of the bat. In the air for ages, and Williamson runs back from midwicket to complete the catch"
10.3,"Shakib to Narine, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and the ball spins away from Narine again. He tries to hit it over cover, but Narine manages to slice this over point! Kaul chases after it, but the ball picks up pace after hitting the practice pitches. Can't pull it back"
10.2,"Shakib to Narine, no run","stumped? The umpire's going upstairs. Good-length ball outside off, and the ball spins away from Narine this time. Tries to smash this over the bowler's head, but misses it completely. Replays suggest that Narine got his backfoot down in time though. Not out"
10.2,"Shakib to Narine, 3 wide","full toss outside leg stump, and Narine misses the pull. But the keeper can't hold onto it either, which forces Stanlake - at short fine leg - to go chasing behind it"
10.1,"Shakib to Narine, 2 runs","full outside off, and Narine dances down the wicket. Crunches a drive past cover, but Yusuf Pathan's full-stretched dive at long off saves the boundary"
9.6,"Kaul to Lynn, no run","short on off, and Lynn tries to flat-bat this towards the off side. Comes off the bat's top half, and in the air. Lands just short of cover!"
9.5,"Kaul to Lynn, FOUR runs","Kaul unlucky again! Overpitched on off stump, and Lynn's drive takes the inside edge. Misses leg stump and runs away to the fine-leg boundary"
9.4,"Kaul to Lynn, no run",yorker on leg stump and Lynn does well to squeeze this away towards the off side
9.3,"Kaul to Lynn, SIX runs","full outside off, and Lynn's done waiting. Makes room to the leg side and muscles this over the bowler's head. Rashid Khan - at long on - runs to his left and tries to take a diving catch. Manages to get his left hand to it, but the ball pops out, then hits his shoulder, and then finally falls beyond the boundary"
9.2,"Kaul to Narine, 1 run","back of a length outside leg, and Narine makes room on the leg side. Pulled, but mistimed, over square leg to the man in the deep"
9.1,"Kaul to Narine, no run","full outside leg, and Narine tries to swing towards the leg side. Inside edge, but falls short of the keeper diving to his right"
8.6,"Shakib to Narine, 1 run","Pandey again, but this time he drops it! Full on off, and Narine went through with the golf swing. Hit it well, and looked like it was gonna go over long on, but Pandey jumped, took the catch, and then threw it back in since he was falling over. Tried to return and complete the catch, but the ball falls short. He threw the ball back in with just a bit too much power. Saves five runs nonetheless. Time out"
8.5,"Shakib to Lynn, 1 run","full on middle, and Lynn backs away. Tries to smack this down the ground but mistimed to long off"
8.4,"Shakib to Narine, 1 run","good length on off, and Narine tries to work it on the leg side. Takes the leading edge towards cover instead"

8.1,"Shakib to Lynn, no run","full outside off, and Lynn drives away from his body. Straight to cover"
7.6,"Stanlake to Narine, no run","back of a length on middle, and angling away from Narine. My, my, he shoulders his arms in a T20"
7.5,"Stanlake to Narine, no run","welcomes him with a short ball on leg stump. Narine goes deep into his crease, and defends off the back foot"
7.4,"Stanlake to Rana, OUT","Pandey takes a screamer! Stanlake celebrates but the wicket's all Pandey's. Cuts this ball super hard, but Pandey - at point - dives to his right and sticks both hands out. The ball popped out of his hand, but managed to take the catch eventually as Pandey returned back to Earth. Excellent!"
7.3,"Stanlake to Rana, no run","short on leg stump, and the ball soars over Rana's head. He happily gets under the line of this delivery"
7.2,"Stanlake to Lynn, 1 run","good length on middle, and fended off the front foot. Lynn went to the leg side but Stanlake's delivery angle followed him. Rana wanted the single, but Lynn wasn't sure. They complete it eventually"
7.1,"Stanlake to Lynn, 2 runs","goes short first up. Tapped off the back foot to third man, and Yusuf misfields! The ball slips through his hands and almost goes to the boundary. Does well to pull it back"

6.5,"Shakib to Lynn, no run","full just outside off, Lynn backs away and carves it towards point"

6.1,"Shakib to Lynn, no run","good length on off, and spinning into Lynn. Punched to cover"
5.6,"Rashid Khan to Rana, FOUR runs","half-tracker on middle, and spinning away from Rana. He backs away, and cuts this hard past point. No stopping that!"
5.5,"Rashid Khan to Rana, no run","full on leg stump, and spinning across Rana's body. Defends the wrong'un off the front foot"
5.4,"Rashid Khan to Rana, SIX runs","flighted on middle stump, and Rana's picked this length early! Down on one knee, and slog swept over cow corner. Not timed extremely well, but enough behind Rana's swing to take it into the stands. First six off Rashid this season"
5.3,"Rashid Khan to Lynn, 1 run","full on off, and spins away from Lynn. He walks across to the off side and nudges towards midwicket"
5.2,"Rashid Khan to Rana, 1 run","tossed up on middle, and Rana attempts a wide leg-side heave. Hit towards midwicket, but was in the air for a while"
5.1,"Rashid Khan to Rana, no run","good length on middle and spins into Lynn! Cramped for space, and manages to push it towards cover"
4.6,"Kaul to Lynn, FOUR runs","crunched through the covers! Raw power on display here. Pitched up on off, and Lynn swings his bat with all the force of this world. Smacked to the wide long-off boundary"
4.5,"Kaul to Lynn, no run",full and wide outside off again! Lynn backs away and therefore can't reach at it. Through to the keeper
4.4,"Kaul to Lynn, 2 runs","overpitched wide outside off. Lynn sticks his bat out, and cuts this past point. Backward point dives to his right and manages to get fingertips to it"
4.3,"Kaul to Lynn, FOUR runs","Lynn's lucky this time! Full on off, and he tries to smack this over the bowler's head. Except, this time Lynn finds the bat's inside edge and sends it fine down the leg side. Another knuckleball this time, but much better execution"
4.2,"Kaul to Lynn, FOUR runs","good length, but wide outside off. Lynn backs away and then slashes this over point. Three men in the infield, but clears all of them. The chase from the fielders are futile. Replays suggest it's the knuckleball"
4.1,"Kaul to Lynn, no run","starts off with the slower ball. Did that slip out of his hand? It's short on middle, and Lynn tries to pull. But he's through his shot too early. Mistimed towards short fine leg"
3.6,"Stanlake to Rana, no run","another excellent ball! Four dots to end the over. Similar ball to the one previously in the over. Good length on middle, and beautifully angling away from Rana as he tries to defend. He's lucky that didn't fine the outside edge"
3.5,"Stanlake to Rana, no run","good length on leg and Rana's cramped for room this time. Tapped to cover off the back foot, but rather unconvincingly"
3.4,"Stanlake to Rana, no run","beauty! Nice shape, and the ball just misses Rana's outside edge. Good length on middle stump and angling tantalisingly away from Rana. He tried to defend, but played it down the wrong line"
3.3,"Stanlake to Rana, no run","good length on middle stump, but angling across Rana. Shoulders his arms this time"
3.2,"Stanlake to Lynn, 1 run",back of a length outside off and Lynn backs away. Chops it down to third man this time
3.1,"Stanlake to Rana, 1 run","short ball first up, and Rana gets his eyes off the ball! Gets big on him, and hits his handle as Rana tries to look away. Lands safe, just in front of point. Quick!"
2.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, 1 run","good length, and outside off. Rana sticks his bat out and pokes it towards point. Calls early for the single"
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, FOUR runs","good length outside off, and angling further away. Perfect ball to the new man to get his eye in. Slaps this square, and beats both point and third man"
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, OUT","appeal for caught behind! But not given. Williamson reviews straightaway. Sunrisers look convinced. It was a good length ball outside off, and jagging just into Uthappa. He tried to run it fine, but the ball took the outside edge. UltraEdge shows a big spike, and the umpire has to reverse his decision"
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, 1 run","good length on middle, and heaved towards midwicket. Mistimed once again, but gets off strike"
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, FOUR runs","back of a length outside off, and Lynn gives it a big heave. Hits it over the non-striker, but bounces just in front of mid on. The fielder jumps over the ball, and it races away to the boundary thereafter. Mistimed shot but gets four"
2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, 1 run","short outside off, and fended off the back foot towards the off side. They jog across for the single"
1.6,"Stanlake to Lynn, no run","good length on middle and angling sharply into Lynn. The batsman had made some room on the leg side, so Stanlake did well to follow him. Lynn taps it towards point"
1.5,"Stanlake to Lynn, no run","back of a length outside off. Angling into Lynn, and defended off the back foot"
1.4,"Stanlake to Lynn, FOUR runs","full on middle, and driven inside out over Stanlake. Williamson, at mid off, goes running backwards, and even sticks his hand out, but the ball drops out of his right hand. Terrific effort, but just too difficult. Another boundary"
1.3,"Stanlake to Lynn, FOUR runs","short outside off, and Lynn crunches this off the back foot. Slapped past backward point as the ball races away for a boundary. Manish Pandey groans 'nooo' as Lynn leans into that shot"
1.2,"Stanlake to Lynn, no run","big swing of the bat from Lynn, but misses completely. Good length outside off, and just about enough room to free his arms"
1.1,"Stanlake to Uthappa, 1 run","back of a length on off, and angling into Uthappa. Worked off his body to square leg, and they take off for the run. Shakib's throw at the striker's end isn't a direct hit, or else Lynn would've been in trouble"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, no run","back of a length first up to Lynn. Superb accuracy from Bhuvneshwar, which forces Lynn to defend off the back foot"
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, 1 run","full outside off, and tapped with soft hands to point. Slight hesitation, but they scamper across for the single eventually"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run",stays back of a length again. Uthappa walks across to the off side and blocks off the back foot. Four dots to start the match. Can he finish well?

0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run","back of a length, but just outside off. Fended off the back foot towards cover"
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, no run","good length outside off, and Uthappa defends it away. Bhuvi starts off with two slips"
19.6,"Mustafizur to Roy, 1 run","it clears cover, and they complete the run. Delhi celebrate. Yes yes, it's another cutter outside off. Roy swings again, like he has been doing and the ball lobs off the outside half, but because every one is in, the ball clears the infield. And Delhi Daredevils complete a thrilling seven-wicket win against Mumbai."
19.5,"Mustafizur to Roy, no run","125 kph, shortish delivery outside off, Roy misses another dab and it's another dot. Mumbai want to review. No bat. It's a dot. "

19.3,"Mustafizur to Roy, no run","a slower ball outside off, that's the length that will cut off the pitch. Roy makes no contact."
19.2,"Mustafizur to Roy, SIX runs","and that's the game! Gambhir is pumped. Mumbai are despondent. What an inning sfrom Roy, it's the same shot that Jadhav played to get six in game 1. A full delivery on middle and leg, flicked away over fine leg for six. Such power in those wrists."
19.1,"Mustafizur to Roy, FOUR runs","smashed for four! Full and wide from Mustafizur, it's not a bad option but it's slow because he's looking for the cutter. With that length, it won't cut. Drilled over cover for four."
18.6,"Bumrah to Iyer, no run","another wide yorker, another offcutter! Inside the tramline. Sensational bowling. Iyer is beaten again as he tries to dab the ball. That is predictable, but still so hard to get bat on that."
18.5,"Bumrah to Iyer, no run","DOT BALL! 122 kph, another cutter, it's just inside the tramline too. Iyer misses a dab."
18.4,"Bumrah to Roy, 1 run","a full wide delivery outside off, driven to long-off for one. Could not get under the length of that."
18.3,"Bumrah to Roy, 2 runs","a slower ball outside off, Roy is completely deceived, the ball lobs over the bowler, a chip for a couple. Did not pick that cutter."
18.2,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run","a low full toss on middle, hoicked away to deep midwicket, on the bounce. Not a bad result for Mumbai."
18.1,"Bumrah to Roy, 1 run","a slower ball outside off, guided to deep point for one. Just one. Roy wants two."
17.6,"Mustafizur to Iyer, FOUR runs","it's too predictable, the length that is. Short around middle and leg, pulled away into the gap between square leg and midwicket. The ball lands just inside the boundary, four."
17.5,"Mustafizur to Iyer, no run","dot ball! Another cutter outside off, another swat, another swing and miss."
17.4,"Mustafizur to Iyer, 2 runs","full and wide, carved over backward point. By the time deep point gets across to his left, two easy runs."
17.3,"Mustafizur to Iyer, no run","a predictable cutter, around off. Iyer misses a swat, dot"
17.2,"Mustafizur to Roy, 1 leg bye","and they concede the leg bye eventually! A full delivery down leg, Roy looks for the paddle scoop. The ball hits the pad to fine leg. Roy sends Iyer back, the throw is to the non-striker's end. Mustafizur doesn't bother colecting the throw and so concedes an extra"
17.1,"Mustafizur to Iyer, 1 run","a cutter on middle, pushed to cover for one. Roy and Mustafizur collide. But the run is easily done."
16.6,"Bumrah to Roy, no run","a low full toss outside off, looking for the reverse paddle scoop but he hits the ball back into hos body."
16.5,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run","that should be the match! A short delivery outside off, Iyer goes back and goes slashing. Straight to Mustafizur at a good height too, at short third man. The ball bursts out, a big, big drop"
16.4,"Bumrah to Iyer, FOUR runs","another boundary! Another short, slower ball outside off. Slashed away in front of point for four. The fielder patrolling the sweeper cover area has no chance."
16.3,"Bumrah to Roy, 1 run","a yorker outside off, jammed into the pitch and then over mid-off for a run."
16.2,"Bumrah to Roy, FOUR runs","a slower delivery, a cutter, swatted away through midwicket for four. Smashed away."
16.1,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run","Mustafizur drops that! A slower delivery outside off, a thick leading edge just about carries to short third man. Mustafizur dives in front, but the ball pops out."
15.6,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","short and slow down leg, worked to wide long-on for one."
15.5,"Krunal to Iyer, no run","slow down leg, Iyer misses a big slog, struck on the pad."
15.4,"Krunal to Iyer, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, carved away towards point. Rahul Chahar, the sub fielder, dives away to his left, but the ball trickles into the boundary. Sloppy."
15.3,"Krunal to Roy, 1 run","slow on leg, pushed to long-off"
15.2,"Krunal to Roy, SIX runs","sightscreen! Very well bowled, a slower delivery outside off, and wide too. Roy comes down and just chips the ball straight, still so much timing that it hits the sighscreen"

14.6,"Dananjaya to Iyer, no run","92 kph, bottom hand. Slow outside off, driven back to the bowler."

14.3,"Dananjaya to Roy, 1 wide","flat and wide outside off, outside the tramline"
14.2,"Dananjaya to Roy, 2 runs","bottom hand, all of it. How else was it possible for him to get under such a full delivery and hit it in the air? Slogged away to deep midwicket, the fielder runs in, the ball is just short."
14.1,"Dananjaya to Iyer, 1 run","89 kph, slow down leg, nudged to short fine leg for one."
13.6,"Krunal to Roy, no run","83 kph, flat down leg, some spin too. Roy misses a hard sweep, struck on the body."

13.3,"Krunal to Roy, 1 run",driven to long-on for a run.
13.2,"Krunal to Maxwell, OUT","sensational catch by Hardik Pandya, off his bro's bowling. A slower delivery outside off, the ball is flighted and loopy. The ball spins away but Maxwell can't back down from his hit over cover. But because of that spin, the ball skews away off the outside half. Hardik runs around to his left, keeps his eyes on the ball and dives full length to get both hands on the ball to clasp the ball. But he doesn't let go of the ball even as his body and arm and shoulder hits the ground. Terrific catch."
13.1,"Krunal to Roy, 1 run","under-edged? A flat delivery outside off, Roy looks for the cut, the ball beats the keeper en route to short fine leg."
12.6,"Markande to Maxwell, SIX runs","another six. The runs just keep coming, the shots too. A legbreak on leg, Maxwell heaves his sweep with enough timing and power over square leg."
12.5,"Markande to Maxwell, FOUR runs","too straight, four on the bounce. A loopy delivery on leg, Maxwell clears his front leg and boshes a straight powerful drive to long-on"
12.4,"Markande to Roy, 1 run",another push in front of point for a run.
12.3,"Markande to Maxwell, 1 run","a legbreak, and straight. Slogged to deep square leg."
12.2,"Markande to Maxwell, 2 runs","another googly down leg, worked away to deep midwicket. Right in the gap, so two easy."
12.1,"Markande to Roy, 1 run","a googly on middle, slogged to deep midwicket. Suryakumar misfields, but no damage done."
11.6,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run","slow on middle, 78 kph. Maxwell pushes the ball to Krunal's right. He dives and stops the ball."
11.5,"Krunal to Pant, OUT","great catch by Pollard. A slower delivery outside off from Krunal, Pant looks to hit the ball over long-off, wanted to get under that, but the ball just skews away after the bat turns in his hand. The fielder dives to his left and takes the catch, diving to his left. Making a tough catch look relatively easy."
11.4,"Krunal to Pant, no run","another yorker, on leg, jammed out."
11.3,"Krunal to Roy, 1 run","shortish and wide outside off, pummeled to long-on for one."
11.2,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run","a yorker outside off, a good defensive option, punched to long-off"
11.1,"Krunal to Pant, FOUR runs","80 kph, a slower delivery outside off. Pant gets under the length of that and drills the drive right back at the bowler. Over the bowler and four."
10.6,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run","a slower ball down leg, worked to deep square leg for one"
10.5,"Bumrah to Pant, no run","a slower ball down leg, worked into the leg side for one."
10.4,"Bumrah to Roy, 1 run","good length outside off, chopped down to third man."
10.3,"Bumrah to Roy, FOUR runs","just over mid-off. Full outside off, Roy nails the drive with so much power and enough timing that even Pollard can't get there with a well-timed leap. He may have done some damage too"
10.2,"Bumrah to Roy, 2 runs","a misfield. Full and wide outside off, carved to backward point. A fumble allows two and Roy's fifty"
10.1,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run","on a length down leg, nudged down to fine leg for one."
9.6,"Dananjaya to Pant, 1 run","flat on middle, worked into the gap at long-on. Roy wants two but he's rightly sent back."
9.5,"Dananjaya to Pant, SIX runs","that is huuuuuge! Pant comes charging down again, gets to the pitch and smashes the ball over long-on. Fantastic timing."
9.4,"Dananjaya to Roy, 1 run","slightly shorter, around off, pulled to deep midwicket, one."
9.3,"Dananjaya to Pant, 1 run","good batting, slow on leg, worked away to midwicket"
9.2,"Dananjaya to Pant, FOUR runs","flat down leg, swept down, using just a bit of bat to get that gap. Deft touch. The fine paddle sweep races past short fine leg."
9.1,"Dananjaya to Pant, SIX runs","superb shot! Six more. Mumbai's spinners are being mauled. Pant runs down, gets close to the pitch and lofts the ball cleanly and elegantly over long-on."
8.6,"Markande to Pant, 1 run","another sweep, to deep square leg for a run. May have been another googly, to avoid bowling in the arc."
8.5,"Markande to Pant, FOUR runs","84 kph, four more. Markande being taken for plenty! Short on middle and leg, Pant rocks back and pulls this neatly through square leg for four."
8.4,"Markande to Roy, 1 run","a googly outside off, chopped down to short third man for a run."
8.3,"Markande to Roy, SIX runs","juuuust over long-off! A googly outside off, Roy watches the ball till very late and swats a sweep-type stroke with enough power over the fielder"
8.2,"Markande to Pant, 1 run","another googly outside off, drilled down to long-off"
8.1,"Markande to Pant, FOUR runs","just over short third man! A googly outside off, Pant stays low and reverse-paddles the ball over the fielder's head at third man. Juust enough elevation"
7.6,"Dananjaya to Roy, no run","has it bounced? Ground-boot or boot and air? A flat delivery outside off, Roy chops the ball into hos leg, the ball pops up. Kishan dives full length to his right and take the catch full. The soft signal is out, but that's the wrong decision because the ball has hit the ground."
7.5,"Dananjaya to Roy, no run","a low full toss, almost a yorker. Jammed the shot into his foot."
7.4,"Dananjaya to Roy, 2 runs","didn't read that either but improvised well. Short and wide, slashed away to deep point for two."
7.3,"Dananjaya to Pant, 1 run","short down leg, nudged down to short fine leg for one."
7.2,"Dananjaya to Roy, 1 run","short outside off, the ball turning away, swatted to long-off. Don't think he read that one."
7.1,"Dananjaya to Pant, 1 run","slow on off, pushed in front of point for a quick single. Cover can't stop one."
6.6,"Markande to Pant, 1 run","another short googly outside off, cut to deep point. One."
6.5,"Markande to Pant, FOUR runs","95 kph, hammered to deep midwicket for four. A googly outside off, he rocks back and hits the ball to the opposite side of the field, to midwicket"
6.4,"Markande to Pant, FOUR runs","he finds the gap this time and gets four. Flat and wide, hit away through cover for four. Rocks back, uses the width and frees his arms."
6.3,"Markande to Pant, no run","a googly outside off, moving further across, cut to cover."
6.2,"Markande to Pant, no run","short around off, Pant goes back and swats one to cover."
6.1,"Markande to Roy, 1 run",comes down and works the ball to deep midwicket

5.4,"Mustafizur to Roy, no run","good length on middle, pushed back to the bowler."
5.3,"Mustafizur to Pant, 1 run","a full delivery on middle and leg, hoicked across the line to deep square leg for one."
5.2,"Mustafizur to Roy, 1 run","full down leg, pushed away to mid-on for a single."
5.1,"Mustafizur to Gambhir, OUT","taken! Mumbai strike. A back of a length delivery on middle and off, Gambhir stays on the back foot, looking to pull but he is hurried through the stroke, due to the pace of the ball. All he can do is splice a pull to Rohit at midwicket"
4.6,"Pandya to Roy, no run","a wide yorker outside off, jammed out to cover"
4.5,"Pandya to Roy, FOUR runs","hammered for four more. A slower delivery around off, beaten with immense power right over the bowler. These slower ones are not working to Roy. 21 off five"
4.4,"Pandya to Roy, SIX runs","six more! That is humongous. Back of a length on middle and leg, Roy watches the ball onto his pull and goes bosh over square leg."
4.3,"Pandya to Roy, SIX runs","massive. A slower ball again from Hardik, it's right in the slot. Lofted cleanly and sweetly over long-on."
4.2,"Pandya to Gambhir, 1 run","full and wide, an offcutter, driven to deep cover for one."
4.1,"Pandya to Gambhir, FOUR runs","heaved away over square leg for four! It's a slower ball, on leg. Gambhir picks the length, stays back and heaves the ball behind square. The ball lands just inside the boundary."
3.6,"Mustafizur to Gambhir, 1 run","good stop by Pollard. Full and wide outside off, carved away to mid-off's right. Pollard dives away and saves three to prevent a boundary"
3.5,"Mustafizur to Roy, 1 run","chipped over the bowler! A cutter on middle and leg, Mustafizur's length is good too. Roy looks to turn the ball away but the ball splices over"
3.4,"Mustafizur to Gambhir, 1 run","shortish and wide, carved away to deep cover for a run. Looking to hit the ball too hard."
3.3,"Mustafizur to Gambhir, no run","full delivery outside off, a badly-timed drive to mid-off. Gambhir under pressure."
3.2,"Mustafizur to Roy, 1 run","shortens the length slightly. Back of a length outside off, punched to deep cover"
3.1,"Mustafizur to Roy, no run","full delivery outside off, driven to cover."

2.5,"Bumrah to Gambhir, no run","143 kph, full on middle and leg. That's Gambhir bread and butter. He misses a flick, struck on the pad. Just two runs off the over."
2.4,"Bumrah to Gambhir, no run","Gambhir struggling to account for the bounce! Back of a length outside off, another swing and miss."
2.3,"Bumrah to Gambhir, 2 runs","a slower ball on middle and leg, helped along to the square leg boundary. Fine leg gets across."
2.2,"Bumrah to Gambhir, no run","a swing and miss. Back of a length on off, or just wider. Gambhir backs away and misses a drive. Just over the off stump."
2.1,"Bumrah to Gambhir, no run","good length outside off, the ball angles away and beats Gambhir. Just the angle."
1.6,"Dananjaya to Gambhir, 1 run","flat on middle and leg, worked away to deep midwicket, Gambhir style, for one."
1.5,"Dananjaya to Roy, 1 run","googly on middle and leg, nudged to deep midwicket for a run."
1.4,"Dananjaya to Roy, FOUR runs","87 kph, short around off, hammered away through wide mid-on for four. That's a rubbish delivery"
1.3,"Dananjaya to Roy, no run","80 kph, flat and wide outside off, swatted to mid-off from the back foot."
1.2,"Dananjaya to Roy, SIX runs","huuuge! Runs down to the pitch, gets close enough and T20s the ball away over midwicket. A big hoick across the line, 95 metres."
1.1,"Dananjaya to Roy, no run","flat outside off, punched to mid-off from the back foot."
0.6,"Pandya to Gambhir, FOUR runs","that's a poor ball. Good length down leg, worked away easily through backward square leg for four. Pandya is not happy with that finish, his fault though."
0.5,"Pandya to Gambhir, no run","a big appeal. No. Pad says the umpire. Mumbai agree. Gambhir isn't unhappy. So seems like the right decision. Full down leg, Gambhir misses a flick. Clips the pad."
0.4,"Pandya to Roy, 1 run","back of a length outside off, Roy stands tall again and smashes a punchy drive to that deep cover. 145 kph, says the speed gun."
0.3,"Pandya to Roy, FOUR runs","that's width! Good length outside off, Roy stands tall and punches through cover for four. On the up."
0.2,"Pandya to Gambhir, 1 run","strays down leg, helped along to fine leg. Mustafizur moves smartly to his left to stop the boundary."
0.1,"Pandya to Roy, 1 run","full and swinging back in outside off, worked away with the angle of swing to wide mid-on"
19.6,"Boult to Markande, 2 runs","full and straight, 134 kph, sliced to deep point for a couple. A valiant dive, has he made it? He has, so two more for Mumbai."
19.5,"Boult to Dananjaya, 1 run","good length on middle and leg, swatted away to the bowler and mid-off for one."
19.4,"Boult to Markande, 1 leg bye","a yorker at 137 kph on the pads, one leg bye down to fine leg. Pitched outside leg stump."
19.3,"Boult to Markande, 2 runs","short outside off, carved away down to third man for a couple, well played. Take what you can now."
19.2,"Boult to Dananjaya, 1 run","full outside off, outside-edged down to third man for one."
19.1,"Boult to Pandya, OUT","117 kph, a slower ball on middle and leg, Hardik slogs the ball away to deep midwicket. Picks out the fielder on the boundary. The momentum has been sucked out of this innings."
18.6,"Shami to Dananjaya, no run","full delivery outside off, Dananjaya fails to make contact. Another dot ball."
18.5,"Shami to Dananjaya, 2 runs","a slower ball outside off, chipped over short cover for a couple."
18.4,"Shami to Dananjaya, no run","excellent use of the short ball, a bouncer on off. Dananjaya sways out of the line, dot."
18.3,"Shami to Krunal, OUT","off the pad or bat? Pad, says the umpire. Daredevils want to review. It's a good-length delivery outside off, Krunal gets right across and works the ball into his pad, and then to short fine leg. Big inside edge and that decision should be out. A successful review, can make a big difference to the total. Was looking for the ramp over short fine leg, but insufficient contact to beat his thigh."
18.2,"Shami to Pandya, 1 run","it's another low full toss outside off, hammered away to long-off. Just one."
18.1,"Shami to Krunal, 1 run","full outside off, Krunal comes charging and drives to long-off for one."
17.6,"Boult to Krunal, 1 run","a full, wide delivery is awkwardly slogged to long-on for one."
17.5,"Boult to Pandya, 1 run","a slower delivery outside off, carved to backward point for a run."
17.4,"Boult to Krunal, 1 run","a low full toss on off, 136 kph, worked to deep midwicket for one."
17.4,"Boult to Krunal, 1 wide","139 kph, an excellent wide yorker outside off. The ball creeps under the bat. Called a wide, quite harshly."
17.3,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, OUT","Roy takes the catch to dismiss Rohit. A slower delivery outside off, Rohit gets under the ball and slices the ball towards mid-off. Not enough timing, not enough power, the only two not-enoughs-of you need at the Wankhede."
17.2,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","a low full toss outside off, carved away in front of extra cover for two. There are three men inside the circle on the off side, so he uses that wrist to slice the ball."
17.1,"Boult to Krunal, 1 run","a full delivery outside off, Krunal gets right across and uses his bottom hand to whip the ball towards wide long-on for a single."
16.6,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","lovely shot and a good stop too. A low full toss outside off, drilled past cover. Vijay Shankar makes lots of ground to his right and stops the boundary."
16.5,"Shami to Krunal, 1 run","well bowled, the wide yorker outside off, sliced to deep point for one."
16.4,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",a low full toss is bunted to long-on for one. Rohit wants to stay there for the last two overs.
16.3,"Shami to Krunal, 1 run","full outside off, skewed away to the sweeper cover for a run."
16.2,"Shami to Krunal, FOUR runs","just over mid-off. A slower delivery outside off, Krunal gets under the length and lifts the ball over the fielder."
16.1,"Shami to Krunal, no run","another yorker outside off, driven to cover. The innings losing momentum."
15.6,"Christian to Krunal, 1 run","full and straight, worked away to deep midwicket for a run."
15.5,"Christian to Pollard, OUT","a first-ball duck for Pollard. He comes down, looking to work the ball into the leg side. But he walks far across while looking to find his first run. The ball, a nothing delivery on off, clips the back of his front pad and then ricochets into the off stump. Not been a great start to the IPL for Pollard."
15.4,"Christian to Ishan, OUT","127 kph, looking for the reverse-hit! A full toss on middle and leg, the friendlies of deliveries to swing into the leg side, but he premeditated that shot. He can't make contact with that high full toss and the ball connects with the stump."
15.3,"Christian to Ishan, 2 runs","a shortish delivery on middle and leg, pulled to deep midwicket for a couple. Not quite the best timing, but in the gap ably."
15.2,"Christian to Ishan, FOUR runs","hit over cover! A full and wide delivery at 118 kph., Kishan gets enough power behind the shot to hit the ball over cover for four."
15.1,"Christian to Ishan, 2 runs","short on middle and leg, swatted away to deep square leg for a couple. A 50-run stand"
14.6,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, no run","yorker on the stumps, right on target, dug out by the Mumbai captain"
14.5,"Shami to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length around off, pulled quietly to deep midwicket for one"
14.4,"Shami to Ishan, FOUR runs","that's another shot he isn't in control of. It's a short delivery and Kishan haphazardly pulls as it gets too big on him, and ends up skewing it off the top-edge to the fine leg boundary"
14.3,"Shami to Ishan, no run",another shot to the same fielder but the intent was a lot different on this occasion. He reached out to a widish length ball and threw hard hands looking to force it through the off side
14.2,"Shami to Ishan, no run",tries to pull off an encore there but this time he finds the short third man fielder
14.1,"Shami to Ishan, FOUR runs","if you want to know about placement, look at that. Kishan simply gets on top of a short of a length delivery by using the depth of the crease and opens the face to run it straight between short third man and keeper"
13.6,"Christian to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","and finally Rohit gets a move too. Got some catching up to do with the rest of his mates, the Mumbai captain. On this occasion, he makes use of Christian's angle as he bangs one into the batsman and Rohit swivels and helps it along to the fine leg boundary"
13.5,"Christian to Ishan, 1 run",fails to get entirely on top of this short one and pulls unconvincingly to midwicket
13.4,"Christian to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length ball outside off, Rohit fends it away towards the short third man region off the outside of the bat"
13.3,"Christian to Ishan, 1 run",advances down the ground and uses the wrists to flick with the angle to deep midwicket
13.2,"Christian to Ishan, no run","full and angled in at off, Kishan crunches a straight drive. Everything alright with that, except that he hit it too straight, so much that it crashes right into the stumps at the non-striker's end"
13.1,"Christian to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","back of a length and angling in on leg, flicked through midwicket"
12.6,"Tewatia to Ishan, SIX runs","comes running down, gets underneath the length and slogs the ball neatly over midwicket for six more."
12.5,"Tewatia to Ishan, SIX runs","the switch hit for six! A low full toss on middle and leg, Kishan knows Tewatia is trying to take the ball away from him with googlies. Helped along over deep backward point."
12.4,"Tewatia to Ishan, FOUR runs","drops short, Kishan reads the length, hurries back and pummels the pull into the gap at midwicket for four."
12.3,"Tewatia to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","overpitched on middle, worked to deep midwicket. Long-on prevents two"
12.2,"Tewatia to Rohit Sharma, no run","83 kph, looking to come down and turn the ball to midwicket but fails to make adequate contact. Off the pad"
12.2,"Tewatia to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide",drifts down leg for a wide. Another slider.
12.1,"Tewatia to Ishan, 1 run","short and wide outside off, slashed to deep point for one."
11.6,"Maxwell to Ishan, 1 run","short down leg, worked to deep midwicket for a single. A productive over."
11.5,"Maxwell to Ishan, FOUR runs","that's four. Flat down leg, Ishan helps it down to the fine leg boundary with a paddle sweep, a poor delivery and four."
11.4,"Maxwell to Ishan, no run","flat and quick on off, hits the pad and then to third man via the pad"
11.3,"Maxwell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","works the ball to deep midwicket, with the spin."
11.2,"Maxwell to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","nicely played! Flat and short outside off, Rohit just opens the bat face and taps the ball through slip. No slip. Four."
11.1,"Maxwell to Ishan, 1 run",driven to long-on for a single.
10.6,"Tewatia to Rohit Sharma, no run","some control now for Delhi. Flat on middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler."
10.5,"Tewatia to Rohit Sharma, no run","slightly short and wide, tapped down to short third man."
10.4,"Tewatia to Ishan, 1 run","a googly, short and wide, slashed to deep point for one."
10.3,"Tewatia to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slow on middle, driven to long-off with the spin."
10.2,"Tewatia to Yadav, OUT","given! Tewatia strikes. Suryakumar has been given out lbw, will he review? Yes. He wants to check, did it pitch outside leg? No. Did it slide past leg? Was there some glove? There was no immediate review from Suryakumar, so he didn't think so. There's a thin spike on UltraEdge. HawkEye shows the ball is just clipping the side of leg stump. So Mumbai keep their review, but lose Suryakumar. He was looking for a sweep through square leg, but missed the ball. It pitched on leg and slid on."
10.1,"Tewatia to Yadav, 2 runs",comes down and skews a drive to deep midwicket. Didn't quite get to the pitch of that. Two anyway.
9.6,"Maxwell to Ishan, no run","slow around off, pushed back to the bowler."
9.5,"Maxwell to Yadav, 1 run","flat outside off, the ball turning in, pushed in front of point for a single."
9.4,"Maxwell to Yadav, 2 runs","overpitched down leg, worked away into the gap at midwicket for two. Fifty for Suryakumar, a terrific innings"

9.2,"Maxwell to Yadav, 1 run","flat outside off, worked to long-on for a single."
9.1,"Maxwell to Yadav, no run","flat outside off, driven to cover."
8.6,"Tewatia to Lewis, OUT","88 kph, Lewis holes out this time! Another googly outside off, Lewis comes charging and skews an attempted hoick, off the outside half of the bat. It lobs to Roy at mid-off to end a sensational opening stand."
8.5,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run","flat and quick down leg, worked away to deep midwicket"
8.4,"Tewatia to Lewis, 1 run","short and wide outside off, carved to deep point"
8.3,"Tewatia to Lewis, SIX runs","juuuust six! Skewed, but six. Some flight outside off, Lewis runs down and doesn't bother about the googly. Goes through with the shot, and just gets enough to clear the straight boundary"
8.2,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run","over cover for a single. Some flight around middle, Suryakumar looks to work the ball against the spin, but a thick leading edge over mid-off."
8.1,"Tewatia to Lewis, 1 run","flat and wide outside off, carved to deep point for a single."
7.6,"Maxwell to Lewis, 1 run","overpitched outside off, driven to long-off. A nice over from Maxwell."

7.4,"Maxwell to Lewis, no run","flat on middle and leg, worked away to midwicket"
7.3,"Maxwell to Yadav, 1 run",another push to long-on for a spin. A lull in play currently

7.1,"Maxwell to Yadav, 1 run","flat outside off, pushed to long-on for a run."
6.6,"Tewatia to Lewis, no run","decent end. Just three off that over. Flat on off, pushed back to the bowler"
6.5,"Tewatia to Lewis, no run","goes for the almighty hoick over deep midwicket but makes no contact. A topspinner outside off, a wild swing and miss."
6.4,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run","strays on the pads, nudged down to fine leg for a run."
6.3,"Tewatia to Lewis, 1 run","flat outside off, a punch to long-off from the back foot"
6.2,"Tewatia to Lewis, no run","the googly outside off, punched to cover from the back foot."
6.1,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run","on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
5.6,"Christian to Lewis, SIX runs","more absolute filth from Daredevils. A cutter outside off that is a half-volley. Lewis says why both with four when I can check mys shot and get six for it. Smashed over mid-off. That's an 84-run Powerplay for Mumbai, their highest in the IPL"
5.5,"Christian to Lewis, no run","a length delivery around off, that's a much better length. Defended back"
5.4,"Christian to Lewis, FOUR runs","another overpitched delivery outside off, Lewis just uses what he's given and throws his arms at the width to get some free IPL runs. Smashed through cover."
5.3,"Christian to Lewis, no run","a slower ball down leg, pushed away towards mid-on."
5.2,"Christian to Lewis, FOUR runs","four more! 127 kph, a wide yorker outside off is sliced away to deep point for four. Mumbai have 74 with four balls left in the Powerplay."
5.1,"Christian to Lewis, FOUR runs",a slower offcutter outside off and Lewis nails that too. Smashed through cover for four. Bludgeoned almost.
4.6,"Shami to Yadav, FOUR runs","137 kph, more rubbish from Daredevils. Another low full toss down leg, flicked away easily to deep midwicket. He didn't learn from the previous error."
4.5,"Shami to Yadav, no run","another low full toss on the pads, that's another poor delivery. Suryakumar works the ball elegantly but finds midwicket. Timing is awesome but placement isn't."
4.4,"Shami to Yadav, no run","on the bounce to mid-off. A low full toss is bunted to the fielder at mid-off, Maxwell"
4.3,"Shami to Yadav, no run","well bowled, a full delivery around off, driven to cover"
4.2,"Shami to Yadav, FOUR runs","that's terrific batting. A yorker outside off, a wide yorker. Suryakumar opens the face of the bat, uses the pace again and carves the ball down to third man for four."
4.1,"Shami to Yadav, SIX runs","this is more filth. Short down leg, would you want the ball anything else? Suryakumar helps that along over fine leg for six. Just uses that pace and erroneous line."
3.6,"Nadeem to Lewis, no run","flat around middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler this time."
3.5,"Nadeem to Lewis, no run","slightly better, short outside off, bunted back to the bowler."
3.5,"Nadeem to Lewis, 1 wide","93 kph, flat down leg, wide. Another extra."
3.4,"Nadeem to Lewis, SIX runs","this is tripe! Filth from Nadeem. Short down leg, Lewis rocks back and pulls that easily and gleefully over square leg for a humongous six. Mumbai's fastest IPL fifty. An appalling start from Daredevils."
3.3,"Nadeem to Yadav, 1 run","Maxwell gets to this, on middle and leg, worked away to wide mid-on. Maxwell dives to his right and stops the ball."
3.2,"Nadeem to Yadav, FOUR runs","another misfield! It's short outside off, Suryakumar stands back and pummels a drive right back to his left. Nadeem sticks out a left hand but can't do much to stop the ball."

2.6,"Boult to Lewis, no run","140 kph, the yorker on off, worked to midwicket. Mumbai are flying at 40 for 0."
2.5,"Boult to Lewis, SIX runs","bunted for six! On a length on middle and off, Lewis watches the ball late and then just chips the ball with all his muscular prowess over mid-on. Way over for six."
2.4,"Boult to Yadav, 1 run","now Boult errs in line, on the pads, worked away to deep square leg."
2.3,"Boult to Yadav, FOUR runs","four more! Back of a length outside off, Suryakumar improvises a late upper cut despite taking his eyes off the ball very early. Somehow he got his periscope of a bat up and ramped the ball over."
2.2,"Boult to Yadav, no run","brings back the length slightly, shorter and wide outside off, cut away to extra cover."
2.1,"Boult to Yadav, FOUR runs","a nod of appreciation from Rohit. It's too full again and Suryakumar nails his drive right back, a lovely, languid drive past mid-off's right"
1.6,"Nadeem to Lewis, 2 runs","Boult stops the four! He's running back from short fine leg and just about gets there. That was a sensational effort. A flat delivery on middle and leg, Lewis gets a thick leading edge on his sweep, the top edge lobs in the air over fine leg. He races back, the ball is just beyond his reach and he pulls the ball back in despite losing balance."
1.5,"Nadeem to Lewis, no run","darts this one on outside off, pushed away to mid-off"
1.4,"Nadeem to Yadav, 1 run","too flat again, on leg. Pushed away to mid-on for a run."

1.1,"Nadeem to Yadav, FOUR runs","extremely sloppy from Daredevils. A bad bad start. Flat down leg, worked away to wide mid-on. Maxwell dives to his left but falls over the ball and concedes four."
0.6,"Boult to Lewis, 4 leg byes","did he play a shot? Back of a length down leg, Lewis thinks of playing but bails out of the stroke. The ball ricochets down to fine leg off the pad. The umpire thinks there was a shot."
0.5,"Boult to Lewis, FOUR runs",slightly shorter and Lewis reads the length very quickly. He stays back and pulls over square leg. Too short.
0.4,"Boult to Yadav, 1 run",
0.3,"Boult to Yadav, FOUR runs",past Gambhir's right this time at mid-off. No swing at all for Boult. It's full outside off and a gentle loosener for Suryakumar to drive easily. Drilled.
0.2,"Boult to Yadav, no run","134 kph, full outside off, driven to cover for nothing."
0.1,"Boult to Yadav, 2 runs","an overpitched start to begin. Full and wide, Suryakumar Yadav smashes that drive to Gambhir at mid-off, who labours to his left. A fumble allows two."

18.4,"Tye to Mandeep, 1 run, OUT","shortish and outside off, Mandeep swats it across the line to deep midwicket. Mandeep chances a second. It just wasn't there. Dagar, the sub fielder, throws it flat and hard to the keeper, who takes the bails off to catch Mandeep well short of the crease"

18.1,"Tye to AB, OUT","Tye hushes the Chinnaswamy into silence. He goes short and outside off, AB upper cuts it in the air and holes out to Karun Nair at deep point.  Tye gives Kings XI hope. RCB need 10 off 11 balls"

17.1,"Sharma to Mandeep, 1 run","off-stump yorker, dug out through cover-point"
16.6,"Mujeeb to AB, SIX runs","This is more emphatic from AB and the Chinnaswamy roars in approval. Dragged down outside off, rocks back and nails a pull over midwicket. He sends it soaring into the stands"
16.5,"Mujeeb to AB, SIX runs","floated full and outside off, AB goes for the loft. Instead he slices it, but that's enough to clear the boundary at the Chinnaswamy. Up and over the long-off boundary"
16.4,"Mujeeb to Mandeep, 1 run","zippy offbreak on middle, pushed back to Mujeeb, and he lets the ball burst through his hands for a single. Mujeeb and AB collide. Just a single"

14.5,"Sharma to AB, FOUR runs","low full-toss outside off again, AB shimmied outside leg, then jumps across off and slog-sweeps it between deep midwicket and wide long-on. Neither Karun nor Stoinis committed. They simply let the ball through them to the boundary"

5.6,"Kaul to Lewis, OUT","Kaul strikes twice in his first over. He hits the top of off stump and leaps for job. He brings out the knuckle ball, Lewis has no clue about this variation. He is early into his leg-side swing. Kaul cleans him up"
5.5,"Kaul to Lewis, 2 runs","good length on middle, Lewis manufactures room and slices it in the air over mid-off. Williamson runs back from mid-off, dives, then swivels around swiftly to stop the ball from the reaching the boundary. Excellent work from Williamson"
5.4,"Kaul to Lewis, FOUR runs",overpitched and outside off - right in Lewis' swinging arc - he drills it away between the bowler and mid-off. Rasping drive
5.3,"Kaul to Lewis, no run","full and shaping away outside off, squirted to the leg side"
5.2,"Kaul to Ishan, OUT","Sunrisers have their man finally. Back of a length and angling away outside off, Kishan looks to slog it away against the angle and across the line.

5.1,"Kaul to Ishan, no run","back of a length on the hips, worked away to midwicket"
4.6,"Rashid Khan to Lewis, no run",another fast wrong'un from Rashid. Lewis picks it off the pitch and jabs to cover
4.5,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run",Sandeep at mid-off drops a relatively simple chance. Pops in and pops out. Rashid unfurls a wrong'un that slides away outside off. Kishan dares to step out and slog. He only top-edges it hiiiiigh into the night sky. It drops down and Sandeep drops it
4.4,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 4 leg byes","flat dart, Kishan ventures a reverse-sweep and does not make contact. Off the thigh pad and rolls away between the keeper and slip. The tracker confirms it pitched outside leg"

3.2,"Stanlake to Lewis, no run","Stanlake responds with a fiery bouncer on leg stump, forcing the left-hander to duck under it"
3.1,"Stanlake to Lewis, FOUR runs","back of a length and outside off, 145ks, the extra pace of Stanlake works to Lewis' advantage. He stands tall and unleashes a jabbing punch through extra cover. Fetch that"
2.6,"Sandeep to Ishan, FOUR runs","around the wicket, full, angling in and straightening to take the outside edge this time. It wanders away fine of short third man for four. Sandeep threatening both edges"
2.5,"Sandeep to Ishan, FOUR runs","Kishan forays down the track, back of a length on middle, he swings so hard that he loses his shape and drags an inside edge past the leg stump and into the fine leg boundary"

2.3,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run","back of a length on middle and leg, Sandeep gets it to straighten, defended"

2.1,"Sandeep to Lewis, SIX runs","First runs in the IPL for Lewis. He launches it into the second tier beyond fine leg. This was a poor ball. Short and sliding outside leg, he picks it off his hips and swivel-pulls it away"
1.6,"Stanlake to Rohit Sharma, OUT","Shakib dives forward from square leg and pouches a low catch to dismiss Rohit Sharma. Another failure for him as Mumbai Indians' opener. This was short, skiddy, and attacking the body, Rohit is cramped up. This isn't a full-blooded flick. He chips it in the air and watches Shakib take a sprawling catch"
1.5,"Stanlake to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","even fuller and outside off, Rohit frees his arms and laces a drive through the covers. The ball fizzes away to the boundary"
1.4,"Stanlake to Rohit Sharma, no run","full and outside off, patted into the covers"
1.3,"Stanlake to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length and just a shade outside off, tapped into the covers"

0.6,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run","Lewis pats the ball to the left of the bowler, Sandeep swoops down on the ball but misses the direct hit. Lewis wanted a risky single but was sent back by his partner"
0.5,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run","good length and attacking the stumps, blocked"
0.4,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","Deepak Hooda drops it! Sandeep hits a hard length on middle, cramps up Rohit for room. He goes for a pull, instead skies it in the air.  Three men converge on the ball, neither call, and Hooda runs back from midwicket, stretches his hands only to shell it"
0.3,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length and holds its line on off stump, Rohit negotiates it carefully"
0.2,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","very full and angling in, defended"
0.1,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","Sandeep starts off with a gem of a ball! Perfectly-pitched ball. Full, shaping to swing away, comes in, then again swings away past the hanging bat"
5.6,"Laughlin to Morris, SIX runs","a six to finish! Another swervy slower delivery outside off, Morris stands in his crease and smashes the ball over long-on for six. Rajasthan enjoy their hoemcoming too, beating the Delhi Daredevils by 10 runs"
5.5,"Laughlin to Morris, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off, smashed over cover for four. But doesn't do much to the crowd or Delhi's mood."
5.4,"Laughlin to Shankar, OUT","takes the catch! A slower ball on leg, Shankar bunts the ball away again to long-on. Stokes runs in and takes a simple catch to seal Delhi's fate. A match-changing 10 balls from Laughlin."
5.3,"Laughlin to Shankar, 2 runs","full outside off, chipped away over cover. Wild cheers from the Rajastahn crowd because they've won this game without any extras in the next three balls."
5.2,"Laughlin to Morris, 1 leg bye","smashed on the helmet! This is a terrific delivery again. Doesn't bother with the slower ball, goes short and fast and accurate. Morris can't connect with a pull, the ball pings him on the helmet."
5.1,"Laughlin to Shankar, 1 run","a length delivery outside off is swung away to deep midwicket, it shapes away again."
4.6,"Unadkat to Pant, OUT","that's very, very high and taken by Gowtham! A slower delivery is right in the slot, he would not want it anywhere else? It's on the pads too. Pant swings too early again and hits the ball in the air, backward square leg runs in and takes the catch, a very good, smart, hold-your-composure catch."
4.5,"Unadkat to Pant, no run","was that required? Gambhir ain't happy with the shot selection. A full delivery on the pads. Pant looks for a switch hit, because third man is up. But the ball goes past and hits Pant on the pad."
4.4,"Unadkat to Pant, FOUR runs","116 kph. A slower delivery down leg, Pant pulls that, but gets the ball behind square for a boundary. Over fine leg. He's too early through the shot, but he won't care. Four."
4.3,"Unadkat to Morris, 1 run","well executed from Rajasthan, good from Rahane and Unadkat. A low full toss very wide outside off if sliced away to that deep backward point fielder."
4.2,"Unadkat to Morris, FOUR runs","well played, four. Again, the wide yorker. Morris slices the ball through backward point for four. Third man is up, point is back, which is why he bowled that line."
4.1,"Unadkat to Pant, 1 run","a nice, slower delivery on middle and leg. Pant swings to deep midwicket, the ball goes very high but lobs in no-man's land."
3.6,"Laughlin to Morris, 2 runs","that's a match-changing over. Just seven off it. A full, wide delivery outside off, sliced through backward point for two."
3.5,"Laughlin to Morris, no run","again, the slower floaty away-going delivery, beats Morris' drive. DOT!"
3.4,"Laughlin to Maxwell, OUT","the slower one, 113 kph, the ball pitches and swerves away. Maxwell backs away and swings himself off his feet almost. Some floaty, swervy bowling, maybe the knuckle ball? A thick outside edge is easily taken by Buttler. This has been a terrific over from Laughlin."
3.3,"Laughlin to Pant, 1 run","an excellent yorker, on off. Jammed away to cover. Superb delivery by Laughlin, three very good balls, but five runs easily made."
3.2,"Laughlin to Pant, 2 runs","Laughlin's trademark slower ball. The offcutter. Full delivery outside off, Pant throws everything he has at the ball. The ball goes reallllly high, long-on runs in towards the 30-yard circle but the ball pops out. Tripathi the fielder. Three fielders converging. Dropped!"
3.1,"Laughlin to Pant, 2 runs","a low full toss, a nice delivery. Drilled down to long-off, a misfield, rather understandable with these wet conditions. Two anyway easily made."
2.6,"Unadkat to Maxwell, FOUR runs","134 kph, four more. Three dots and three boundaries. Very predictable again, full and wide, but inside the tramline. Maxwell slices over point for four. That was a good comeback from the batsman after losing his shape."
2.5,"Unadkat to Maxwell, SIX runs","that is maaaasive! Wheee goes the ball over long-on. It's a 116 kph offcutter outside off, and by now it's predictable. Maxwell shuffles across, gets underneath the length and says not every ball, mate. Pummeled over long-on."
2.4,"Unadkat to Maxwell, FOUR runs","136 kph, it's full and wide again, may have been a wide had Maxwell left that alone. Maxwell swings, gives the ball everything he has. A thick outside edge flies over short third man."
2.3,"Unadkat to Maxwell, no run","three wide deliveries, three dots! A full and wide delivery that is brilliantly bowled. Inside the tramline. Maxwell can't get bat on ball again."
2.2,"Unadkat to Maxwell, no run","3 off 7 for Maxwell. That was right in the slot. He has just gotten off an airplane. Full outside off, it's in the hitting arc and Maxwell misses his slog again."
2.1,"Unadkat to Maxwell, no run","a swing and miss! A very wide delivery outside off, Maxwell walks across, looking to heave into the leg side. The ball is too wide to drag. Wrong shot selection."
1.6,"Kulkarni to Maxwell, 1 run","terrific bowling. A full, straight delivery is hit away to mid-off for one. Excellent end to the Powerplay."
1.5,"Kulkarni to Maxwell, no run","oh my. That's right in the arc. A short offcutter on middle and leg. Maxwell attempts a ramp over short fine leg, but shuffles across and is through his shot too early. Goes over leg stump"
1.4,"Kulkarni to Pant, 1 run","excellent bowling again. The offcutter with the wet ball is a brave ball. To get some cut and flummox the batsman is even more impressive. Pant is too early into the shot, toe-ended to the keeper."
1.3,"Kulkarni to Pant, no run","full delivery outside off, it's absolutely belted to mid-off for no run. Smashed."
1.3,"Kulkarni to Pant, 1 wide","a very wide delivery outside off, called a wide."
1.2,"Kulkarni to Maxwell, 1 run","excellent bowling. Maxwell is backing away, Dhawal follows him with a very full delivery. Almost a yorker. The ball hits the back leg, one leg bye."
1.1,"Kulkarni to Pant, 1 leg bye","a slower ball on middle and leg, Pant stays low and aims to help it along over fine leg, but can't make contact. Struck on the body. One body bye."
0.6,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run","a nice low full toss, driven to long-on, 108 kph. An easy 10 off the over."
0.5,"Gowtham to Pant, FOUR runs","a flat delivery down leg, Pant stays low and heaves the ball over short fine leg for four. That's a poor delivery."
0.4,"Gowtham to Pant, no run","a flat delivery, on middle and leg. Pant comes down but the trajectory is much flatter. Inside-edged into the pad, and then into the off side. Gowtham runs to the ball to prevent one."
0.3,"Gowtham to Pant, FOUR runs","smashed for four. Pant comes running down, gets close to the pitch and nails his drive over the bowler. Good-enough timing."
0.2,"Gowtham to Maxwell, 1 run","a low full toss, a yorker. Pushed to long-on. Not much Maxwell can do with that."
0.1,"Gowtham to Maxwell, OUT","a diamond duck for Munro! A flat start from Gowtham on the pad, the ball ricochets towards square leg. Munro comes charging down, looking for the leg bye but Maxwell sends him back. Munro turns around and heads back, but the throw is on the bounce to the bowler, and Gowtham takes the bails off, with Munro well short."
17.5,"Shami to Gowtham, 2 runs","drifts down leg, flicked away through backward square leg for a couple."
17.5,"Shami to Gowtham, 1 wide",a short loopy bouncer over the head.
17.4,"Shami to Buttler, OUT","and out of a yorker! That's Buttler bread and erm butter. But he misses this. Buttler walked right across, looking to scoop the ball over fine leg, but it's a slower ball on leg. And very very full. Despite his excellent hands, he can't quite improvise fast enough to that delivery. Misses and the ball hits leg stump."
17.3,"Shami to Buttler, no run","139 kph, strays down leg. Buttler misses a flick. Just clips the pad to the keeper."
17.2,"Shami to Buttler, no run","on the pads, skewed away to square leg"
17.1,"Shami to Buttler, SIX runs","gets underneath the length, gives himself room and knows exactly what he's doing. Lofted cleanly and easily over long-off, too easy."
16.6,"Morris to Buttler, 1 leg bye","142 kph, a full toss down leg, would you want it anywhere else? Buttler did not expect such a friendly delivery and reaches the ball very late. The ball hits the front pad, sliding down."
16.5,"Morris to Buttler, FOUR runs","short and wide, too much width. Cut over backward point for four. That's very clever batting. Nicely chopped away."
16.4,"Morris to Buttler, no run","shortish outside off, Buttler misses his swing."
16.3,"Morris to Buttler, SIX runs","gets under that and sends the ball very very high. Does not quite get the distance. Maxwell circles under the ball,  but he too can't haul the ball back in as he steps over the boundary at long-on"
16.2,"Morris to Tripathi, 1 run","full and wide outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man for a run"
16.1,"Morris to Tripathi, SIX runs","taken on the deep midwicket boundary, but tries to throw the ball back in as his momentum takes him over the boundary. His throw back in is futile because he has stepped over the boundary. A slower ball is smashed over deep midwicket"
19.5,"Vinay to Jadeja, SIX runs","over long on! And CSK complete another heist. Full on middle stump, but Jadeja gets his front foot out of the way to smack this over Vinay's head. In the slot to be punished, and Jadeja does exactly that. It lands in the second tier and with that the CSK boys come running out! The hosts win by five wickets"
19.4,"Vinay to Bravo, 1 run",full and wide outside off. Bravo drags his shot to long on this time. No chance of a double
19.3,"Vinay to Jadeja, 1 run","good length on off stump, and Jadeja carves this to point for a quick single. Gets Bravo back on strike"
19.3,"Vinay to Jadeja, 1 wide","full and slow outside off, but that's too wide! Jadeja lets it go as the umpire stretches his arms"
19.2,"Vinay to Bravo, 1 run","short on middle, and Bravo pulls this square to cow corner. It's in the air, but falls short of the man at cow corner. Bravo wanted the second, but Jadeja chooses not to come back. DJ's not happy!"
19.1,"Vinay to Bravo, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, but that's been smacked over long on's head. Taken in the deep, but that's a free hit, so he's safe! Bravo comes back for the second"
19.1,"Vinay to Bravo, (no ball) SIX runs","waist-high full toss on leg stump, and Bravo simply swings through to the leg side. It's taken a leading edge, but has enough behind that for the ball to go beyond the fine-leg boundary! Perfect way for CSK to start the over. Free hit as well"
18.6,"Tom Curran to Bravo, 1 run","yorker on leg stump, and all Bravo can do is flick it off his toes to deep midwicket. CSK need 17 off the final over"
18.5,"Tom Curran to Jadeja, 1 run","short on middle, and Jadeja cuts it to Chawla at point. Diving effort stops the ball, and ensures they can only take the single"
18.4,"Tom Curran to Billings, OUT","holes out to long off! Full outside off, but slightly slower this time. Billings is through his shot too early, and that comes off the blade's toe end. Billings walks back but not before keeping CSK alive in this match"
18.3,"Tom Curran to Billings, SIX runs","half-tracker on middle, and Billings pulls it away over midwicket! Slight bend of the knee to keep his eyes on the ball, and then sent over the boundary with ease"
18.2,"Tom Curran to Jadeja, 1 run","good length on off, and that's been tapped to backward point. Jadeja scampers across to the other end, but more important, gives the strike back to Billings"
18.1,"Tom Curran to Billings, 1 run","smart bowling, but Billings will get to his fifty. Full and wide outside off, and the batsman is forced to drag a sweep towards the leg side"
17.6,"Russell to Jadeja, no run",full and fast outside off. Jadeja can't make any connection. A useful dot to end Russell's spell
17.5,"Russell to Billings, 1 run","short outside off, and Billings pings this over square leg this time. Drags his shot to Kuldeep at deep backward square"
17.4,"Russell to Billings, SIX runs","back of a length on leg stump, but Billings was expecting that very length! Uses his bottom hand to flat-bat it over long on. Enough connection to take it beyond the boundary. Two terrific shots from Billings"
17.3,"Russell to Billings, SIX runs","ridiculous! Low full toss on middle stump, but Billings shuffles across to the off side. Gets to the other side and then paddles this over fine leg"
17.2,"Russell to Jadeja, 1 run","short on leg stump. Jadeja tries to swivel, but can't pull effectively. Played to deep backward square"
17.1,"Russell to Billings, 1 run","short on middle stump, but Billings makes room on the leg side. Can only punch it down the ground to long off though"
16.6,"Chawla to Billings, 1 run","full on leg stump, and pushed to wide long on. Curran cleans up, but Billings will keep strike"
16.5,"Chawla to Billings, FOUR runs","flat and full outside off, but Billings is quick to spot the length. Goes down on one knee, and bunts it towards the leg side. Manages to play it between deep midwicket and wide long on"
16.4,"Chawla to Jadeja, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and it's a quicker ball to welcome Jadeja! Hits his front leg, but would've probably gone down the leg side. Jadeja wanted the run, though, but he's quickly asked to go back"
16.3,"Chawla to Dhoni, OUT","Dhoni walks! Good length outside off, and the ball stays slightly low. Tries to cut square but the ball goes under his bat. Takes a feather edge, and DK collects like a boss! They don't even bother appealing since the CSK captain starts to walk. Fair-play points, please!"
16.3,"Chawla to Dhoni, 1 wide","flat on leg stump, and goes down the leg side. Extras"
16.2,"Chawla to Billings, 1 run","flat and quick outside off. 114kph, in fact. Billings came down the ground and tried to slog it towards the leg side, but takes the inside edge to short fine leg instead"
16.1,"Chawla to Dhoni, 1 run","overpitched wide outside off. Dhoni muscles this down the ground to long on for only a single. Billings wants a second, but MSD sends him back"
15.6,"Narine to Billings, 2 runs","full on middle stump, and once again whipped to the leg side with soft hands. Uthappa's late to attack the ball, which therefore allows them to take another double. Time out"
15.5,"Narine to Dhoni, 1 leg bye","good length on off stump, but Dhoni gives it a charge again. Tries to flick towards the leg side, but comes off his thigh guard"
15.4,"Narine to Dhoni, no run",flat on off stump. It's overpitched so Dhoni's cramped for space too. Defended towards the off side
15.3,"Narine to Billings, 1 run","short on off stump, and spinning across Billings. Flat-batted down the ground to long on"
15.2,"Narine to Billings, 2 runs","good length on off stump, Billings comes down the wicket and taps with soft hands towards midwicket. Nobody's there, so they comfortably come for the second run"
15.1,"Narine to Dhoni, 1 run","short on middle, and Dhoni muscles his pull towards deep midwicket"
14.6,"Tom Curran to Billings, SIX runs","waist-high full toss, Billings drags his pull behind square! Soars into the stands as CSK get 17 off the over. The ball was aimed into Billings' body, but he was in the perfect position to go through with that shot. Lucky that wasn't called a no ball"
14.5,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, 1 run","slower ball, full on middle. Carved towards cover point with soft hands"
14.4,"Tom Curran to Billings, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump. Mistimed to mid off, and Billings steals another single"
14.3,"Tom Curran to Billings, SIX runs","full outside off, and Billings makes room on the leg side. In the slot for him to free his arms, and Billings sends it over deep extra cover! Comfortably lifted over cover"
14.2,"Tom Curran to Billings, 2 runs","full on middle, and that's been smacked over Curran! Uthappa, at mid off, runs backwards but drops it! Gives Billings a reprieve"
14.1,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, 1 run","good length just outside off, and Dhoni glances it to point for a quick run"
13.6,"Kuldeep to Billings, 2 leg byes","good length on off, and spinning away from Billings. Tries to sweep and he misses, but so does DK! More runs for CSK to collect"
13.5,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 1 run","quicker ball, and flat on leg stump. Clipped off his pads to fine leg"
13.5,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 1 wide","short and wide outside off. Too wide, in fact, and Dhoni's happy to let it go"
13.4,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, SIX runs","smashed over wide long on! This game's back alive, folks! Tossed up on leg stump and Dhoni whips this off his toes and into the stands. Excellent bat speed!"
13.3,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, FOUR runs","straight down the ground! Full on off, and Dhoni comes shimmying down the wicket. Smashes it past Kuldeep thereafter, and the bowler did well to ensure he didn't get his fingertips to it. That would've stung"
13.2,"Kuldeep to Billings, 1 run","length-ball on off, but spinning away from Billings. Cut to Curran off the back foot on this occasion. KKR won't mind these"
13.1,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 1 run","short on middle stump, but Dhoni can't time the pull well. Put a lot of power behind that shot, but mistimed to deep midwicket"
12.6,"Chawla to Dhoni, 1 run","good length outside off, but Dhoni cuts it straight to Lynn at short third man. Almost carried to the man, in fact. Dhoni will be relieved"
12.5,"Chawla to Billings, 1 run","good length on off, but straightens after pitching. Carved off the back foot to the man in the deep"
12.4,"Chawla to Billings, 2 runs","half-tracker on off, and Billings works it to cow corner on this occasion. Misfield from Curran allows them to take the second run"
12.3,"Chawla to Billings, FOUR runs","flighted on middle stump, but Billings is up to the challenge! Comes down the wicket and whips it excellently past midwicket. Wide long on can't parry it back and that's a very useful boundary"
12.2,"Chawla to Dhoni, 1 run","full outside off, but zipping into Dhoni's pads. Tried to cut after backing away, but takes the inside edge. It goes between his legs and through to the leg side"
12.1,"Chawla to Dhoni, no run","flat to start off. On middle stump, and Dhoni defends it back to Chawla"
11.6,"Narine to Dhoni, 1 run","wide outside off, and that's been cut hard past point. Quick bat speed on display from Dhoni this time"
11.5,"Narine to Dhoni, no run","full on off stump, and Dhoni comes charging down the wicket. Tries to drive, but checks his shot in the end. Tapped towards Narine"
11.4,"Narine to Billings, 1 run","good length outside off, but spins away from Billings. Worked towards the on side and played down the ground"
11.3,"Narine to Raina, OUT","short on off stump, and Raina tries to pull over cow corner, but he's got no power behind that shot - presumably because of his leg injury. The ball's in the air for ages, and Vinay Kumar settles under it at long on. Another big wicket down"
11.2,"Narine to Dhoni, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and Dhoni makes room on the leg side. Punches it past cover to the man in the deep"
11.1,"Narine to Dhoni, no run","big appeal for lbw! But turned down. Narine wants to review. It was a good-length ball on middle, and zipped straight through. Dhoni tried to defend but the ball sneaked between bat and pad. Impact's in front of middle stump, but would that have hit the stumps? Dhoni's big stride may have saved him. Yep, missing middle stump. Too high, so KKR lose their review"
10.6,"Kuldeep to Raina, SIX runs","uses his bottom hand to lift this over extra cover! Full outside off, and Raina hits with the spin. Off the bat's sweet spot, and the ball lands just beyond the wide long-off boundary. That's the team hundred too"
10.5,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 1 run","good length on off stump, and enough room for Dhoni to free his arms. Pulled hard, but not well, to Curran at deep midwicket"
10.4,"Kuldeep to Raina, 1 run","good length on leg stump, and straightens after pitching. Pulled, but along the ground, to the man at deep midwicket"
10.3,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 1 run","good length on off, and spinning further away from Dhoni. Flat-batted down the ground to long off"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, no run","good length outside off, and cut off the back foot. Mistimed to Narine at point"
10.1,"Kuldeep to Raina, 1 run","dropped by Curran! It was full outside off, and Raina lifted it over cover. Came off the bat's toe end, so it was in the air for a long time. Curran, from deep extra cover, runs in, but misjudges the catch. Drops it with the ball dipping in front of him"
9.6,"Narine to Dhoni, no run","full just outside off, and Dhoni's neither here nor there. Stuck in two minds, but eventually pushes towards cover point with the bat's open face"
9.5,"Narine to Raina, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and punched off the back foot to long on."
9.4,"Narine to Dhoni, 1 run","good length outside off, and spinning further away. Dhoni cuts furiously past point. Played to the man in the deep"
9.3,"Narine to Raina, 1 run","flat, and on a good length on leg stump. Clipped off his pads to square leg"
9.2,"Narine to Dhoni, 1 run","good length on middle, but takes some extra bounce! Dhoni manages to paddle this fine down the leg side, but looked rather uncomfortable"
9.1,"Narine to Dhoni, no run","back of a length, but just outside off. Dhoni goes onto the backfoot, and blocks"
8.6,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 1 run","full on middle, and Dhoni comes down the ground. Hits through the ball's line, and the shot goes one-bounce to long on"
8.5,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, no run","half-tracker on middle stump, but spins into Dhoni. Cramped for room, and can't flick it square. Hits his thigh pad"
8.4,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, no run",full on leg stump to Dhoni. Tapped back to Kuldeep off the front foot. Carefully negated
8.3,"Kuldeep to Rayudu, OUT","tossed up outside off, and that's been driven away from his body. Slices his shot slightly, and therefore plays it in the air. Soft dismissal in the deep, as Mavi (the substitute) takes a few steps in from deep extra cover and pockets the catch"
8.2,"Kuldeep to Raina, 1 run","flighted on middle stump, grips and turns across Raina after pitching. Flicked off his pads towards midwicket on this occasion"
8.1,"Kuldeep to Rayudu, 1 run","good length on off, spins away from the right hander. Punched down the ground to mid off"
7.6,"Narine to Rayudu, 1 run","good length on off, and spinning away after pitching. Pulled down the ground to wide long on for a single"
7.5,"Narine to Rayudu, no run","full on middle stump, prods forward and taps it back to Narine"
7.4,"Narine to Raina, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and Raina flat-bats this towards the leg side off the back foot"
7.3,"Narine to Raina, no run",flat on middle stump. Defended off the back foot by Raina
7.2,"Narine to Rayudu, 1 run",good length just outside off. No spin this time as it zips straight through. Chopped to short third man from way close to his body
7.1,"Narine to Raina, 1 run",turned towards midwicket for a single. Flat on middle and leg to start off
6.6,"Russell to Rayudu, no run","full and wide outside off. Forces Rayudu to reach at it, but the ball's inside the tram-lines. An excellent delivery to end the over"
6.5,"Russell to Rayudu, no run","low full toss on middle and leg, and Rayudu smacks it straight down the ground. Well stopped by the bowler on his followthrough, who sticks his right hand out"
6.4,"Russell to Rayudu, no run",good length on off stump. He comes down the wicket but checks his shot. Poked to point
6.3,"Russell to Rayudu, 2 runs","short on off, but Rayudu shuffles across to the off side. Pulls it behind square for a couple more"
6.2,"Russell to Raina, 1 run",good length on middle stump. Raina opens his bat's face and runs it down to third man this time. They walk across for the single
6.1,"Russell to Rayudu, 1 run",slower ball to start the over. Tapped off the back foot to short third man with ease
5.6,"Tom Curran to Raina, no run","almost a yorker on off stump, but Raina's up to the challenge. Defended off the front foot, and here's the time out"
5.5,"Tom Curran to Watson, OUT","pulled, but holes out! Curran strikes in his first over. Short again, and this time the pull isn't hit well enough. Rinku Singh was placed at cow corner after the earlier pull, and this time Watson finds the man. Big wicket for the visitors"
5.4,"Tom Curran to Rayudu, 1 run","takes the pace off this time. Good length on middle, and Rayudu pokes at it. Played towards point for a quick run"
5.3,"Tom Curran to Watson, 1 run","full on off, and the drive's been crunched to Rana at cover point. Stopped well, but his throw doesn't hit the stumps. Allows them to take an overthrow"
5.2,"Tom Curran to Watson, SIX runs","full outside off, and Watson leans into a drive. Lifted over mid off, and it has enough behind it to go beyond long off! Ten off the first two balls"
5.1,"Tom Curran to Watson, FOUR runs","short outside off, and Watson's pulled this with some disdain! Over the infield, and no one's there at the cow-corner boundary"
4.6,"Russell to Watson, 1 run","short on middle, and Watson swivels early to pull. Top-edged, but lands safe. Deep midwicket cleans up"
4.5,"Russell to Rayudu, 1 run","good length on off, and it's been pulled past square leg this time. Not hit well enough"
4.4,"Russell to Rayudu, FOUR runs","good length just outside off, but Rayudu plays a delicate shot this time! Stands tall and waits for the delivery to come to him. Opens the bat's face and ramps it over the keeper thereafter"
4.3,"Russell to Rayudu, 2 runs","misfield at mid off! Vinay Kumar the guilty party here. Punched off the back foot to the fielder, but he takes his eyes off the ball while picking it up"
4.2,"Russell to Watson, 1 run","good length on middle stump, and Watson drops his gloves on this one. Worked to square leg off the back foot"
4.1,"Russell to Rayudu, 1 run","good length just outside off, chopped off the back foot to third man"
3.6,"Chawla to Watson, no run","quicker ball, full on middle stump. Watson defends off the front foot and sees the over out"
3.5,"Chawla to Rayudu, 1 run","full on middle and leg, and the batsman taps it to the leg side with soft hands"
3.4,"Chawla to Rayudu, FOUR runs","good length on off, and Rayudu comfortably punches this square off the back foot. Beats the diving cover-point fielder and Curran can't pull it back either"
3.3,"Chawla to Rayudu, SIX runs","tossed on off stump, and Rayudu punishes this once again! Goes inside out this time, and smacks this over extra cover! KKR are getting hammered here"
3.2,"Chawla to Rayudu, no run","almost chopped on! Good length on off, but zipping inwards after pitching. Tries to cut, but the ball goes nowhere. Lands near his toes"
3.1,"Chawla to Rayudu, SIX runs","and punished first ball! Full on off, and Rayudu comes down the wicket and lifts it over Chawla's head. Full swing of the bat"
2.6,"Russell to Rayudu, 1 run","slower ball, and full on middle. Whipped off his toes to deep midwicket"
2.5,"Russell to Rayudu, no run","short on middle stump, but Rayudu misses the cut. He came down the wicket again, but was too close to his body for the shot. Taken by the keeper from near his head"
2.4,"Russell to Rayudu, FOUR runs","low full toss on leg stump, but that's too easy for the batsman. Flicked off his toes, and past short fine leg!"
2.3,"Russell to Rayudu, no run","good length outside off, but Rayudu comes dancing down the wicket. Tries to slog it down the ground but can't connect with the ball. Through to DK"
2.2,"Russell to Watson, 1 run","good length on off, and Watson taps it off the back foot to mid on"
2.1,"Russell to Watson, no run","shapes away! Good length outside off, and jags away after pitching. Watson tries to defend but the ball goes away from his bat. Could've easily taken the outside edge"
1.6,"Chawla to Watson, 1 run","length at middle stump, tapped through midwicket off the back foot"
1.5,"Chawla to Watson, SIX runs","see ya! Length ball on off stump, he gets down with the forward stride and creams this slog sweep wayyyyy over midwicket"
1.4,"Chawla to Watson, no run","googly, back of a length outside off. Gets on the back foot and nudges to point"
1.3,"Chawla to Rayudu, 1 run","length on middle stump, steps out and drives to long-on"
1.2,"Chawla to Watson, 5 runs","overthrows. Watson dabs a length ball into the leg side and Karthik slides, swivels and throws a very very wide throw as he tries to run Watson out at the other end. Russell puts in a big dive to the left at mid-off but can't stop that"
1.1,"Chawla to Rayudu, 1 run","slider from wide of the crease, coming in at off stump on a good length. He plants the front leg forward and drops it in front of short third man with soft hands"
0.6,"Vinay to Watson, FOUR runs","through the covers now! Vinay Kumar finishes poorly after two dot balls. Length ball outside off, onto the front foot and he punches it on the up"
0.5,"Vinay to Watson, SIX runs",huuuuuge! Puts it up at a length on leg stump and boy does Watson love that. He's made room and is waiting for a clean swing through the ball. Vinay allows him that and he duly drills it over long-on
0.4,"Vinay to Watson, FOUR runs",drops it short and into the body. Watson uses the angle as he stays tall and swats this past short fine
0.3,"Vinay to Watson, 2 runs",short of a length with some shape away outside off. Chases it with his hands and slices it between backward point and cover point. Third man cleans up
0.2,"Vinay to Watson, no run",just over off stump. Watson expects this length ball to climb up and has gone for the pull. It slides through from under the bat and just clears off stump
0.1,"Vinay to Watson, no run",raps him on the pad after getting this to nip back in off the pitch. Watson tentative as he looks to defend this
19.6,"Thakur to Russell, SIX runs","finishes with a six! Overpitched outside off, but it's in Russell's slot. Goes down on one knee, and smacked over long off! KKR finish on 202 for 6"
19.5,"Thakur to Tom Curran, 1 bye","another knuckle ball outside off, and Curran can't hit it. But Dhoni misfields, which makes the batsmen take the bye. They can take overthrows as well, but Russell's not interested"
19.4,"Thakur to Tom Curran, no run","knuckle ball outside off, and Curran can't connect again! Deceived by the pace"
19.3,"Thakur to Tom Curran, no run","saved by Dhoni! He had to dive to his right to stop that ball. Thakur went short outside off, and Curran walked across to the off side as well. But, the batsman can't get bat to ball"
19.2,"Thakur to Russell, 1 run","short on off stump, and Russell's pull doesn't come off. Bottom-edges it towards deep midwicket"
19.1,"Thakur to Russell, SIX runs","width offered outside off, and Russell leans into the drive. It's been tonked over the infield, and the ball lands way beyond deep extra cover. That's his tenth maximum!"
18.6,"Bravo to Russell, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, and Russell flicks this off his pads to deep backward square. Twenty-one runs off the over but importantly, Russell's on strike. Can KKR breach 200?"
18.5,"Bravo to Tom Curran, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and Curran lifts this off the back foot. Played over cover, but there's someone in the deep"
18.4,"Bravo to Russell, 1 run","excellent yorker on middle stump, and Russell does well to get his bat down in time. It's inside-edged to short fine leg, and Curran's halfway down the wicket. There's a misfield there, so Russell chooses to run across as well. Could've been a run-out if Chahar collected the ball cleanly"
18.3,"Bravo to Russell, SIX runs","three in three! Short on off, and Russell swivels to pull. Off the bat's middle and it lands beyond the man at cow corner. The KKR dugout can't believe it"
18.2,"Bravo to Russell, SIX runs","Is that out of the ground as well? Russell's hit that so hard that he's down on the floor. It was another slower ball outside off, and Russell muscles this over long on. Hits the top of the roof!"
18.1,"Bravo to Russell, SIX runs","it's full on leg stump, and Russell whips this off his pads! That's all it was, a simple flick, and the ball soars over deep midwicket. Raw power from Russell"
17.6,"Watson to Russell, 1 run","overpitched, but wide outside off. Russell hits this hard into the ground, and the ball lobs over Watto's head. There's cover in the deep though"
17.5,"Watson to Tom Curran, 1 run","good length on off stump, and Curran backs away to make some extra room. Slaps this square past point to the man in the deep"
17.4,"Watson to Karthik, OUT","yorker on leg stump, and Karthik misses the shot. Hits his back leg, and the appeal's been given out! He's reviewing but that's a futile decision. It hit his back leg, and impact was in front of leg stump. The replay shows that the ball would've clipped leg stump. KKR retain their review but the captain has to go"
17.4,"Watson to Karthik, 1 wide","goes extra short outside off, and Karthik pulls out of the uppercut. Good decision from the KKR captain as the umpire signals extras"
17.3,"Watson to Karthik, no run","short outside off, and DK mistimes his pull. Straight to square leg"
17.2,"Watson to Russell, 1 run","full outside off, and that's been flat-batted down the ground. Almost goes straight down long off's throat, but falls just short of the fielder"
17.1,"Watson to Russell, SIX runs","through extra cover's hands! Full outside off, and Russell smacks this over cover. The man in the deep sticks his hands up, but the powerful shot goes through his palm. Brings up his half-century as well"
16.6,"Bravo to Karthik, SIX runs","now Karthik's joining in! Picks the slower ball nice and early, and DK slogs this over long on with disdain! Nineteen off the 17th over"
16.5,"Bravo to Russell, 1 run","good length just outside off, but tailing into Russell. Tapped off the back foot to cover for a quick run"
16.4,"Bravo to Russell, SIX runs","slower ball, and that's a low full toss on middle stump, but Russell winds up early for exactly that delivery. Gets his front leg towards the leg side and frees himself up enough to swing through the ball's line. Hit flat over wide long on"
16.3,"Bravo to Russell, no run","slower ball, on a good length. Pitches on off stump and goes over Russell's attempted cut shot"
16.2,"Bravo to Russell, SIX runs","that's out of the ground! Full on middle and Russell's spotted this early. Down on one knee, and swung over Bravo's head. A full 105 metres and even Shahrukh Khan needs to crane his neck to see that ball"
16.1,"Bravo to Russell, no run","goes short first. Pitches on leg stump, but Russell goes under the delivery. First-bouncer says the umpire"
15.6,"Thakur to Karthik, no run","low full toss on off stump, but tailing sharply into DK's toes. Tries to play straight, but the swing forces an error from Karthik. He bottom-edges it to the keeper. Could've easily chopped onto his stumps however"
15.5,"Thakur to Russell, 1 run","good length on off stump, and Russell mistimes his pull to cow corner. They jog across for the single"
15.4,"Thakur to Russell, SIX runs","two in two! It's a full toss on off stump, and Russell's not going to miss out on these. It's pumped over the non-striker's head and lands next to the sightscreen"
15.3,"Thakur to Russell, SIX runs","overpitched outside off, and Thakur pays the price for missing his length. Down on one knee, and muscled by Russell over long on. It's not off the bat's sweet spot, but enough behind it to clear the boundary. Thakur's knuckle ball did not come off"
15.2,"Thakur to Karthik, 1 run","short outside off, but not wide enough for the cut. DK bottom-edged the shot to third man on this occasion"
15.1,"Thakur to Russell, 1 run","full outside off, and Russell's not happy to have missed out. Swung through the ball's line, but it comes off the bat's toe end"
14.6,"Tahir to Russell, 1 run","full on leg stump, and Russell powers this down the ground. Beats midwicket's dive, but there's someone in the deep."
14.5,"Tahir to Karthik, 1 run","flighted just outside off, and almost yorks DK. Manages to squeeze it past cover to the man in the deep"
14.4,"Tahir to Karthik, no run","full just outside off. Driven inside-out, but straight to the man at cover"
14.3,"Tahir to Russell, 1 run","shouts of 'catch it' but drops well short of the man at cow corner. Full on leg stump, and Russell's leg-side slog comes off the bat's toe end. Was in the air for a while, though"
14.2,"Tahir to Karthik, 1 run",good length on middle stump. Goes deep into the crease and whips it to square to deep midwicket
14.1,"Tahir to Russell, 1 run",half-tracker on off stump. Punched off the back foot to long off
13.6,"Bravo to Russell, 1 run","full on off stump, and Russell smacks this past the non-striker to long on"
13.5,"Bravo to Russell, SIX runs","over long on! Dropped in the stands, though. Full on off, in Russell's arc. Huge stride forward and makes a solid base to launch. Goes through with his shot thereafter, and it lands in the first tier"
13.4,"Bravo to Karthik, 1 run","slower ball, on a good length outside off. Karthik keeps his eyes on the ball, and plays towards the off side with soft hands. Played into the gap in front of cover"
13.3,"Bravo to Russell, 1 run",another low full toss on middle stump. Russell bunts it down the ground - past Bravo's left - to long off
13.2,"Bravo to Russell, no run","good length on off. The ball's angling into Russell, who chooses to defend off the back foot"
13.1,"Bravo to Karthik, 1 run","starts off with a low full toss. It's aimed on his toes, and batsman taps it down the ground to long off"
12.6,"Tahir to Russell, no run","full and wide outside off. Russell tries to drive with the bat's open face, but it's mistimed. Straight to point"
12.5,"Tahir to Karthik, 1 run",good length on middle stump. Tapped off the front foot to cow corner for a walking single. A good over from Tahir so far
12.4,"Tahir to Russell, 1 leg bye","slower ball, short on middle. The ball's going down the leg side but Russell manages to flick this fine past the keeper. Comes off his thigh guard, in fact"
12.3,"Tahir to Russell, 2 runs","width offered outside off, and Russell cuts this square past point. Man in the deep has to jog across to his left and intercept"
12.2,"Tahir to Russell, no run",tossed up on off stump. Big stride forward and defended
12.1,"Tahir to Russell, no run","full on off, and this one zips straight through! Hurries the batsman onto his back foot,who does well to fend it away"
11.6,"Watson to Russell, 1 run",good length outside off. Russell walks across to the off side and taps to point. Played with soft hands and that allows Russell to take the run
11.5,"Watson to Karthik, 1 run","slower ball but short on middle. Comfortably turned, off his pads, to fine leg"
11.4,"Watson to Russell, 1 run","good length on middle, and Russell bunts this square on the leg side. Slogged - but mistimed - to wide long on"
11.3,"Watson to Russell, FOUR runs","overpitched wide outside off, and Russell drives this past extra cover! Couldn't get under the ball, but he's got enough power to hit through the ball's line. Breaches the gap between cover and mid off"
11.2,"Watson to Karthik, 1 run","just outside off, and Karthik punches this firmly past cover to the man in the deep. Enough time to walk across for the run"
11.1,"Watson to Russell, 1 run","full on middle and coming into his pads, clipped off his legs to the man at cow corner"
10.6,"Tahir to Karthik, no run","tossed up on off stump. Flighted, but defended with ease towards the off side"
10.5,"Tahir to Karthik, 2 runs","half-tracker on off, and spins into DK. Pulled along the ground to the two men in the deep"
10.4,"Tahir to Karthik, no run",good length on middle stump. Karthik goes deep into his crease and blocks off the back foot
10.3,"Tahir to Karthik, no run",tossed up on middle stump. Big stride forward but checks his shot. Tapped towards cover
10.2,"Tahir to Karthik, no run","good length on off stump, tentatively defended off the front foot"
10.1,"Tahir to Karthik, FOUR runs","good length on off, and the ball grips the surface and therefore slows it down. DK changes his grip and reverse-paddles this past slip. Harbhajan's too slow, and loses the chase to the third-man boundary"
9.6,"Thakur to Singh, OUT","fails again! Full on off, and he tries to drive this with the bat's open face. Off the bat's toe end, and pocketed by Bravo at point. He's dancing!"
9.5,"Thakur to Singh, no run","good length on middle stump, and angling across Rinku. Tries to cut, but plays under the ball. Through to Dhoni"
9.4,"Thakur to Karthik, 1 run","good length just outside off, takes the extra bounce into consideration and taps it fine to the fielder at third man"
9.3,"Thakur to Karthik, no run","on off stump, and tailing into his pads. Tapped off the front foot to mid on. Shardul's soft appeal doesn't interest the umpire"
9.2,"Thakur to Karthik, no run","short on off, and that's challenges DK. Looks to pull square but eventually pulls out of the shot. The ball zips past his ears and through to Dhoni"
9.1,"Thakur to Singh, 1 run","good length on middle, and angling away from Rinku. Chopped down to Harbhajan at third man"
8.6,"Watson to Singh, 1 run","on leg stump, and turned off his pads to deep square leg. Rinku gets off the mar as well"
8.5,"Watson to Karthik, 1 run","good length on middle stump, shuffles across and flicks this behinds square on the leg side. Played off his hips"
8.4,"Watson to Karthik, FOUR runs","crunched! Just outside off, and that's been cut square. Rides the bounce and slaps this past point to get off the mark"
8.3,"Watson to Karthik, no run","good length on off stump, punched with the bat's open face to cover"
8.2,"Watson to Uthappa, OUT","good length just outside off. It's punched to cover but there's a hesitation! Raina stops the ball, turns around, and throws it at the non-striker's. Uthappa's struggling, and he's well short when the zing bails come alive. KKR gift CSK a wicket. Karthik wanted the single, but Uthappa wasn't quite sure. Pays the price"
8.2,"Watson to Uthappa, 1 wide",a short ball to welcome DK. Pitches on off and gets big on the KKR captain. He ducks under the line of the ball
8.1,"Watson to Rana, OUT","and gets a wicket first ball! Back of a length on middle, and Rana tries to drag this behind square on the leg side. He's through his shot early, and the ball takes a feather edge off his bat. It hits his thigh pad thereafter, and lobs up into the air. Enough time for Dhoni to run to his right and complete a soft dismissal"
7.6,"Thakur to Rana, 1 run","good length on off, and the ball stays low this time! Pulled along the ground to the man in the deep"
7.5,"Thakur to Rana, 2 runs","good length on off, cut off the back foot past point. Harbhajan's diving effort at third man is not pretty, but gets the job done"
7.4,"Thakur to Rana, FOUR runs","slower ball on off, and Rana judges the pace early. Lifts this over mid off with ease, and the back-foot punch races into the long-off boundary"
7.3,"Thakur to Rana, no run","short on off, and forces Rana to duck under it. Drops his knees and gets under the line of the ball"
7.2,"Thakur to Rana, no run","good length on off, and angling into Rana. Fended back to Thakur off the back foot"
7.1,"Thakur to Rana, no run","good length outside off, and some extra bounce first up. Punched off the back foot to point, and well stopped by the fielder. Diving effort stops the single"
6.6,"Harbhajan to Rana, 1 run","full just outside off, walks down the wicket and drives to long off. They walk across for the single"
6.5,"Harbhajan to Rana, FOUR runs","good length just outside off. Rana gets on top of the bounce, and cuts it just past point. Beats the infielder and looks like the man in the deep will cut it off but he fails to stop it"
6.4,"Harbhajan to Rana, 2 runs","tossed up on middle stump, and Rana flicks this fine down the leg side. Calls early for the two, and they jog back comfortably. Chase for short fine leg"
6.3,"Harbhajan to Rana, no run",full and wide outside off. Rana tries to cut square but mistimed. Bottom-edges it this time
6.2,"Harbhajan to Uthappa, 1 run",good length on off stump. Uthappa goes deep into his crease and punches it down the ground. Straight to long on
6.1,"Harbhajan to Rana, 1 run","full just outside off, tries to drive towards cover, but takes the inside edge. The ball goes towards midwicket instead"
5.6,"Jadeja to Uthappa, SIX runs",two in a row! And again in the same spot. Full ball and Uthappa simply gets to the pitch of the delivery and dispatches it for six more. Golf-like swing and KKR end the Powerplay on 64
5.5,"Jadeja to Uthappa, SIX runs","full on off, and in the slot for Uthappa. Takes a big stride forward and lofts this over wide long on. Full extension of the arms, and that lands in the stands once again"
5.4,"Jadeja to Rana, 1 run","full outside off, and Rana gets to the pitch of this delivery. Smothers it off his pads to square leg thereafter"
5.3,"Jadeja to Rana, no run","good length just outside off, punched off the back foot towards cover"
5.2,"Jadeja to Lynn, OUT","the leg stump's uprooted! Flatter ball on middle, and Lynn's halfway down the wicket. He misses the leg-side heave, and the ball goes between bat and pad. Crashes into leg stump and Jadeja's pumped!"
5.1,"Jadeja to Lynn, FOUR runs","misfield at short fine leg! Harbhajan the man guilty there. Good length on off, and Lynn walks across to try and paddle towards the leg side. The ball takes his under edge, and goes to Harbhajan, but the ball sneaks under the fielder's fingers"
4.6,"Tahir to Uthappa, SIX runs","classical Uthappa! Full on middle, and he's quick to get down on one knee. Goes through his slog-sweep and smacks this over deep midwicket. Lands in the stands"
4.5,"Tahir to Lynn, 1 run","full toss on off stump, and Lynn muscles this towards cow corner"
4.4,"Tahir to Lynn, FOUR runs","tossed up on middle and leg, but Lynn backs away to make some extra room. Muscles it over cover, and manages to do enough to lift it over the infield. Not off the bat's centre, but enough behind it to take it the extra-cover boundary"
4.3,"Tahir to Uthappa, 1 run","good length on off, and turning away from Uthappa. Punched off the back foot to cover, and he calls for a quick single. Comfortably completed"
4.2,"Tahir to Uthappa, no run","tossed up outside leg stump, and Uthappa tries to slog it towards the leg side. Can't hit it though as the ball comes off his front leg"
4.1,"Tahir to Uthappa, no run",full on off stump. Uthappa prods forward and defends it back to Tahir
3.6,"Jadeja to Lynn, no run","good length on middle stump, and angling into the batsman. He tries to drive it towards cover, but can only punch it towards the fielder there. Man there to protect the run"
3.5,"Jadeja to Lynn, no run","half-tracker on off, but cramps Lynn for space. Defended back to Jadeja"
3.4,"Jadeja to Lynn, no run","good length on off. Lynn rocks back, but can't cut it well. Mistimed towards the off side"
3.3,"Jadeja to Uthappa, 1 run","good length on off. Uthappa goes onto the back foot, and comfortably knocks it towards square leg"
3.2,"Jadeja to Uthappa, no run","beauty! Full on off, and zips straight through. Tries to defend, but the ball sneaks past his outside edge"
3.1,"Jadeja to Lynn, 1 run","good length on off, goes onto the back foot, and carves it square to the man in the deep"
2.6,"Watson to Uthappa, no run","full and wide just outside off. Tries to drive with the bat's open face, but only manages to tap it towards cover"
2.5,"Watson to Uthappa, FOUR runs","chopped past first slip! Raina's dive to his right sn't good enough. It was too close to his body for the cut, but he played it anyway. Off the bat's edge, but just beyond Raina. Third man can't intercept either"
2.4,"Watson to Uthappa, no run","good length on off, and extra bounce this time! Uthappa tries to punch this straight, but comes off the bat's top half. In the air, but drops short of mid off. Played with hard hands"
2.3,"Watson to Uthappa, FOUR runs","full on leg, and that's been beautifully clipped off his toes. Lifted over square leg, and fine leg can't cut it off. Uses his wrists to whip it over the infield. One-bounce and four"
2.2,"Watson to Lynn, 1 run","wide outside off again, and Lynn once again cuts this square. Straight to the man in the deep though"
2.1,"Watson to Lynn, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, and Lynn slaps that past cover! Loose ball from Watto, and that's been crunched in front of the man at deep extra cover. No stopping that!"
1.6,"Harbhajan to Uthappa, no run","full on off, and that's been swept square. Well hit, but stopped by Chahar at square leg"
1.5,"Harbhajan to Uthappa, no run","good length on off stump. Big step forward from Uthappa, and defended back to Harbhajan"
1.4,"Harbhajan to Lynn, 1 run","dropped at square leg! What an effort from Chahar, but the ball pops out of his hand. Short on middle, and Lynn pulled that hard. Chahar dived to his right, but the ball just didn't stick in. Chance goes down"
1.3,"Harbhajan to Narine, OUT","tossed up outside off, and that's been given a wild leg-side slog. Slices it, and the ball's in the air. Raina gets under it from mid off, and takes a comfortable catch from near his face. Big wicket!"
1.2,"Harbhajan to Lynn, 1 run","full on leg stump as he sees Lynn walking across to the leg side. He tries to slog towards the leg side, but mistimed towards midwicket"
1.1,"Harbhajan to Lynn, no run","full on off, spins slightly inwards. Tries to drive away from his body, but mistimed to cover point"
0.6,"Chahar to Narine, SIX runs","this one's bigger! Full on off, and Narine is quick to get his front foot out of the way. Makes the extra room, and goes through with the full swing of the bat. Off the blade's middle, and it lands in the second tier beyond long on. Eighteen off the over"
0.5,"Chahar to Narine, SIX runs","and here we go! Soars over long on. Good length on off, and the ball's in Narine's arc. Cleanly swatted over the bowler with the bat's full swing"

0.4,"Chahar to Narine, 1 wide","pitches on middle, but angles down the leg side. Narine misses the leg-side flick and the ball goes to Dhoni on the bounce"
0.3,"Chahar to Lynn, 1 run","on off stump, and Lynn sticks his bat out. Pokes it past point to the man in the deep. Tahir the man tidying up"
0.2,"Chahar to Lynn, FOUR runs","slashed over point! Good length on off, and that's been cut square. Just over the fielder at point, and the ball races away to the boundary. Enough width for Lynn to free his arms"
0.1,"Chahar to Lynn, no run","good-length ball first up. Pitches on off stump, and Lynn defends off the back foot"
15.5,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",finishes with a boundary. A domineering win finished with an imperious shot. Short of a length in the corridor and he gets behind it to swat it over midwicket
15.4,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, no run",full and wide outside off. Chases and tries to jam it through point. Beaten
15.3,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length just outside off, punched uppishly to mid-off"

10.6,"Gopal to Williamson, 1 run","short ball, pulled out to deep midwicket"
10.5,"Gopal to Williamson, FOUR runs","lifts it past the bowler who is swaying away from it. Williamson hasn't connected this as well as he might have liked. Ends up slicing it a touch, but he's got right to pitch of length ball"
10.4,"Gopal to Williamson, no run","good length on off stump, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
10.3,"Gopal to S Dhawan, 1 run","full googly outside leg stump. Looks to sweep and gets this to short fine. It's hit his leg and deflected towards short fine. The lbw appeal is turned down. They're reviewing it though. It will stay not out, pitching outside leg but it will eat up about three minutes because of the review process. In fact, they give it not out because there's a spike as the ball passes bat"
10.2,"Gopal to Williamson, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, punched to long-off"
10.1,"Gopal to Williamson, no run","length on middle stump, steps out and drills it straight to mid-on"

7.2,"Stokes to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",attempted yorker is pitching well outside leg. Reaches out and tickles this fine. The fielder makes it to the ball but the slide is not quick enough
7.1,"Stokes to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",too easy. Dropped short in the corridor and he gets on the toes of his back leg to swat this uppishly between deep square and deep midwicket
6.6,"Gopal to S Dhawan, 1 run","length ball on leg stump, tickled to deep square's right off the back foot"
6.5,"Gopal to S Dhawan, no run","slider just outside off, punched straight to extra cover off the back foot"

6.3,"Gopal to Williamson, no run","length ball on off, blocked on the front foot"

6.1,"Gopal to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",googly dug in short. It's spinning well past off stump but there's enough time. He gets on the back foot and bruteforces this to the midwicket fence
5.6,"Laughlin to Williamson, FOUR runs",oh glorious. Give us eleven of this guy. Hangs on the back foot to this length ball outside off and opens the face late to drive this between point and cover. Neither of them had a chance

5.4,"Laughlin to S Dhawan, no run","length outside off, punched on the front foot to extra cover"

5.2,"Laughlin to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length in the corridor, dabbed into the gully region with soft hands"
5.1,"Laughlin to Williamson, no run",taken at mid-on. Williamson backs away and looks to pull this from outside off. Gets it straight to the fielder off the toe-end

3.4,"Unadkat to Williamson, no run","offcutter, back of a length at middle stump. Pushed into the leg side off the back foot"

3.1,"Unadkat to Williamson, no run","length ball at off stump, defended off the back foot"
2.6,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, no run",length in the corridor. Looks to drop it pitch side to take a single but can't get it wide of the bowler
2.6,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, 1 wide","yikes. Bouncer very short, pitching outside leg, and sliding further down"
2.5,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, SIX runs",shot! Uses the trampoline bounce to lift this over third man with an upper cut. He's assessed the pitch nicely and predicts exactly where he'll have to meet that ball as it slants across the corridor
2.4,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length outside off, punched straight to point off the back foot"
2.3,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, no run",short and wide outside off. Slashes and misses

1.1,"Unadkat to Saha, FOUR runs","swatted away! Wow, incredible. It's a rising length ball at off stump and he closes the face and chips it over square leg"
0.6,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, no run"," dropped!  Straight in, straight out. Oh, Rahane. What have you done? Dhawan has a slash to a delivery that isn't wide enough for him to flay through point, flies at a comfortable height to the captain who makes a royal mess of that one. Bobbled out, tried to grab on the second attempt but couldn't."
0.5,"Kulkarni to S Dhawan, no run",shapes to pull but lets go this short ball slanting away. Got big on him. Good carry through to Buttler

19.2,"Kaul to Unadkat, 1 run, OUT","short of a length just outside off, backs away and carves it to third man's right. Then comes back for a suicidal second run. Saha takes down all three stumps, the batsman is four yards out."
19.1,"Kaul to Unadkat, no run",short ball at a middle stump line. Backs away and hoicks at it. Can't connect
18.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Gopal, OUT",finds long-on. Knuckle ball on a length at off stump. Gets under it and puts in a clean swing. But it's off the low part of the bat

18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Kulkarni, 1 run",backs away and jabs at this short ball. Gets it out to third man

17.2,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, OUT",drags it on! Googly does Buttler. It's a third dismissal against Rashid after all.

16.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gopal, 1 run",length ball and in at leg stump. Dabbed through square leg with soft hands
16.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Buttler, 1 run","legcutter, length ball outside off. Flicks it to long-on on the up"
16.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gopal, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, steered to third man with an open face"
16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gopal, FOUR runs",shot! Expertly placed. Length ball just outside off and he carves this cover drive well to the right of sweeper cover with a drive on the up
16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gopal, 1 wide",bouncer dug in too short. No chance he's going to hit that
16.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Gopal, no run",good length and in at off stump. Tapped to extra cover on the up
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Gopal, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, sliced to backward point"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Gopal, no run",beats the outside edge with a flat legbreak outside off. Pushes on the front foot to defend. Saha can't hold on
15.4,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, 1 run","googly, back of a length and in at middle stump. Tapped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
15.3,"Rashid Khan to Gopal, 1 run",googly not picked. He's backing away for a late cut and is cramped. Manages to nudge it into the leg side
15.2,"Rashid Khan to Gopal, 2 runs",tossed up outside off and drilled wide of sweeper cover off the front foot
15.1,"Rashid Khan to Gopal, FOUR runs",dabs it past first slip nonchalantly. The other legspiner in this game. Picks this legbreak off the surface and uses his hands to steer it nicely
14.6,"Kaul to Gopal, 1 run","length ball at off stump, sliced to sweeper cover on the up"
14.5,"Kaul to Gopal, no run",fizzes past the bat. Too quick in the corridor and just the perfect length to get it at face height. Batsman has no idea
14.4,"Kaul to Gowtham, OUT",caught behind! Bit tired of saying this now - Kaul surprises him. Gets it to rise sharply from back of a length. He's stuck between a pull and a fend. It lobs up easily for Saha off his front thumb
14.3,"Kaul to Gowtham, no run","good length, angled into the corridor. Chopped straight to point"
14.2,"Kaul to Buttler, 1 run","good length and in at off stump, tapped to long-on on the up"
14.1,"Kaul to Buttler, no run","beaten by pace. Again. Kaul has been unreadable off the pitch. This isn't a great ball though, short and wide. Too late on the cut"
13.6,"Shakib to Buttler, 1 run","length ball outside off, punched to deep extra cover on the up"
13.5,"Shakib to Samson, OUT","sliding Rashid completes the job for Shakib! Superb bowling, superb catching. He pushes this very slow, very wide outside off in anticipation of him stepping out. And he does. Has to reach out in the end and he slices it high. Rashid sprins in rapidly from sweeper, slides on his knees and holds on"
13.4,"Shakib to Buttler, 1 run","length ball on off stump, tapped to point's right off the back foot"
13.3,"Shakib to Samson, 1 run","flighted length ball on middle stump. Presses forward and dabs this to long-on, against the turn"
13.2,"Shakib to Tripathi, OUT","picks out long-on. This was coming. A loopy arm ball on a good length. Tripathi doesn't get close enough for his attempted slog and ends up dragging it flat to Pandey's right at long-on, off the inside half of the bat"
13.1,"Shakib to Tripathi, no run","length on leg stump, steps out and yorks himself. Taps it back to the bowler"
12.6,"Kaul to Samson, no run","length outside off, tapped to extra cover off the back foot"
12.5,"Kaul to Tripathi, 1 run",falls short of third man. They're finding some serious pace off this surface. Tripathi steps out and is surprised by the short ball. Looks to hook and gets a leading edge that lands in front of the diving Stanlake
12.4,"Kaul to Samson, 1 leg bye",appeal for lbw again but it's turned down. Kaul is deceptive off the surface and skids another in at middle stump. Samson looking to punch through midwicket off the back foot. There's an inside edge on that but the umpire says it's leg bye
12.3,"Kaul to Tripathi, 1 run","short ball just outside off, pulled to long-on off the front foot"
12.2,"Kaul to Samson, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
12.1,"Kaul to Tripathi, 1 run",Saha and the bowler have convinced Williamson to take the review on this lbw. It's a bat-first-or-pad situation. He's looking to defend this length ball on the front foot and he's caught unaware by the skid it is pad first. But he's managed to just get outside the line. They'll lose the review and the decision stands.
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Tripathi, 1 run","googly, pushed flat at a length outside off. Mistimed sweep along the floor to deep midwicket's right"
11.5,"Rashid Khan to Tripathi, FOUR runs",jabbed wide of slip after being beaten in flight. Pushes on the front foot and then follow it with his hands as it spins away
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Tripathi, FOUR runs","well placed. Rashid gives away the googly early by lobbing it wide outside off. Tripathi leans in, gets to the pitch and lifts it wide of long-off"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Samson, 1 run","thick outside edge as he gets on the back foot and looks to stab at this with a closed face. It's a length ball at middle stump, turning away"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Tripathi, 1 run",short ball turning away outside off. Drags it to long-on off the back foot
11.1,"Rashid Khan to Samson, 1 run","googly, back of a length at off stump. Punched to long-off off the back foot"

10.5,"Stanlake to Tripathi, 1 run","short ball at off stump, gets on top and drops it into the point region with soft hands"
10.4,"Stanlake to Tripathi, no run","length ball outside off, zips up as Tripathi shapes to play a cover drive on the up. Flies through to the keeper at chest height"
10.3,"Stanlake to Tripathi, no run","short ball outside off, too fast for him again. Beaten on the cut"
10.2,"Stanlake to Samson, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, punched to long-on off the front foot"
10.1,"Stanlake to Tripathi, 1 run","length ball just outside off, hurried on the cover drive. It bounces away to sweeper"
9.6,"Shakib to Samson, 2 runs","length on leg stump, flicks to deep midwicket's right and steals the second as Dhawan fumbles"
9.5,"Shakib to Samson, 2 runs",short of a length and in at leg stump. Gets on the back foot and pulls to long-on's right
9.4,"Shakib to Tripathi, 1 run","short ball skidding in at off stump. Makes room and has placed this cut nicely, but point dives to the right and parries this to sweeper cover"
9.3,"Shakib to Samson, 1 run",yorker on off stump. Digs it out into the cover region and steals the single
9.2,"Shakib to Tripathi, 1 run","good length, slow and just outside off. Pushes with soft hands through cover"
9.1,"Shakib to Samson, 1 run","tossed up outside off, punched to long-off on the up"
8.6,"Stanlake to Stokes, OUT","taken on the second attempt! Williamson at long-on. Stokes looks to pummel a length ball over long-on from outside off. He hits it flat to long-on's left and Williamson loses his grip on the ball as he goes towards the floor. Then, he recovers and lunges ahead to hold on"
8.5,"Stanlake to Samson, 1 run","yorker on middle stump, flicked to long-on off his toes"
8.4,"Stanlake to Stokes, 1 run","short ball at middle stump, swats uppishly to deep square"
8.3,"Stanlake to Stokes, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, closes the face and drags this between deep square and fine leg"
8.2,"Stanlake to Samson, 1 run","length in the corridor, whipped to long-on, on the up"
8.1,"Stanlake to Stokes, 1 run","bouncer on a leg stump line, gets the head out of the way and plays a controlled hook to fine leg"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Samson, no run",inside edge onto pad! Oh Samson's a lucky man. Doesn't pick this googly and has all his stumps exposed as he looks to cut
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Samson, no run","length outside off, punched to extra coevr on the up"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, 1 run","length ball on leg stump, tickled through square leg off the inside half of the bat"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, no run","trapped in front of middle but he's got an inside edge on that. Another slider from Rashid, traps him on the back foot as he looks to nudge this into the leg side"
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, no run","beaten outside off. Or so the umpire thinks. Rashid pushes a slider across Stokes and he can't connect on the reverse sweep. Rashid thinks theremight be glove on that, but they won't review"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, no run","length ball spinning down leg side, he can't get bat on it. Cops it on the pad"
6.6,"Kaul to Samson, FOUR runs",nicely done. Short of a length ball rising up in the corridor. Waits for it to arrive and opens the face to run it past the keeper
6.5,"Kaul to Rahane, OUT","picks out Rashid Khan in the deep! No, correction - Rashid Khan picks him up in the deep! This is a sprinting, sliding catch to his left at deep square leg. Rahane down the track again to meet the length ball at middle stump. It's a nicely timed flick and it's fairly wide of the fielder but he has held on without losing his balance"
6.4,"Kaul to Samson, 1 run","short of a length outside off, opens the face and slices to sweeper cover"
6.3,"Kaul to Rahane, 1 run",falls short of third man where Stanlake is stationed. Rahane steps out and loses shape as he looks to slog across the line to this length ball in the corridor
6.3,"Kaul to Rahane, 1 wide",bouncer dug in too short and wide outside off. Sails past the bat as he looks to hook
6.2,"Kaul to Samson, 1 run","length outside off, punched on the rise to sweeper cover"
6.1,"Kaul to Samson, no run",under edge into the pitch as he looks to pull a length ball from outside off
5.6,"Shakib to Samson, 1 run",dropped short and he quickly gets on the back foot to swat this to deep square
5.5,"Shakib to Rahane, 1 leg bye","big appeal for lbw but Rahane has gotten well outside off stump for this attempted sweep. It's a full ball, not there for the sweep"
5.4,"Shakib to Samson, 1 run","good length on leg stump, tapped uppishly to long-on"
5.3,"Shakib to Samson, no run","short of a length outside off, punched to mid-off off the back foot"
5.2,"Shakib to Samson, FOUR runs","not hit too well but he finds the boundary. Steps out preemptively and is beaten in flight, but this is coming into him and he uses the angle to lift it over midwicket"
5.1,"Shakib to Samson, no run","good length on middle stump, pushes forward to flick straight to midwicket"
4.6,"Stanlake to Samson, 1 run","short of a length outside off, guided to third man with soft hands"
4.5,"Stanlake to Samson, FOUR runs","leading edge flies over point. It's a good ball from Stanlake. 146kph outswinger at a good length, wide outside off. He's looking to flick it and he finds the point boundary"
4.4,"Stanlake to Samson, 2 runs","short of a length ball on leg stump, whipped to deep square"
4.4,"Stanlake to Samson, 1 wide",mean bouncer! Samson is stuck on the crease with no idea where this has gone as he shapes to pull. It's way over his head though
4.3,"Stanlake to Rahane, 1 run","length ball at off stump, closes the face and gets a leading edge to third man"
4.2,"Stanlake to Rahane, FOUR runs","shot. Arches into the leg side to make room against this short, rising ball in the corridor. It's at 147kph so all he does is get his hands under it and slice it wide of third man"
4.1,"Stanlake to Samson, 1 run","low full toss on the pads, flicked to fine leg's left"
3.6,"Shakib to Rahane, no run","length on leg stump, flicked straight to square leg"

3.4,"Shakib to Rahane, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, steps out and jams it to mid-on"
3.3,"Shakib to Rahane, FOUR runs","shot. Length ball, seam-up and coming in at off stump. Steps out and slaps it through extra cover on the up"
3.2,"Shakib to Rahane, no run","length on middle stump, flicked straight to square leg"
3.1,"Shakib to Rahane, no run","full ball, floated in at leg stump. Looks to flick through the open midwicket region and can't get bat on it"
2.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, no run",legcutter. On a length just outside off. Looks to flick but gets a leading edge towards mid-off
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahane, 1 run","full on middle stump, flicked to mid-on"
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, 1 run","length on middle stump, tapped to mid-on's right on the up"
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR runs","shot! This is an unreal shot. Length ball in the corridor and once again, without any feet, he gets behind an outswinger. The unreal part? He's whipped it wide of mid-on, on the up. Genius."
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, no run","length on middle stump, whipped to mid-on off the back foot"
2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR runs","caressed through cover point. Lovely timing. No meet at all, but his hands are nicely behind this outswinger outside off. Punches through the line with no fuss"
1.6,"Stanlake to Samson, 3 runs",shot. Sweetly timed. Length ball angled in at him and he punches it through midwicket
1.5,"Stanlake to Samson, no run",
1.4,"Stanlake to Samson, 2 runs","short of a length and in at leg stump, dabbed to fine leg's left off the back foot"
1.3,"Stanlake to Samson, no run",short of a length and wide outside off with some movement away. A lazy waft by Samson that would've been called lazy elegance if he had made connection. He's beaten though
1.2,"Stanlake to Samson, no run","short of a length just outside off, tapped back at the bowler off the back foot"
1.1,"Stanlake to Samson, no run","good length outswinger, wide outside off. Left alone"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Short, OUT",direct hit from Williamson! Short is struggling. Sunrisers' captain swoops in from mid-off to pick up his mistimed drive and fells the stumps Short is caught short. Stunning work from Williamson. Short took off early for the run after punching on the up but there wasn't one there
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Short, no run","length ball outside off, leans in nicely to tap on the up. Can't get it past cover though. Bit of a mix-up as they're both ball watching. Short runs back after covering half the pitch"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Short, FOUR runs","full on middle stump, stands tall and flicks easily through square leg for his first runs in the IPL"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Short, 1 wide","length ball with some wobble down leg side, can't get bat on the attempted flick"

18.5,"Khejroliya to Vinay, FOUR runs","Vinay Kumar finishes the match with a swat through mid-on to put Kolkata Knight Riders on the board, toppling KKR with a four-wicket win at the Eden Gardens. "
18.4,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 1 run","a short slower ball down leg, helped along to fine leg"
18.3,"Khejroliya to Vinay, 1 run","back of a length down leg, clipped to square leg for a run"
18.3,"Khejroliya to Vinay, 1 wide","133 kph, short down leg, that's wide. Waaaaay over the batsman's head. Shouldn't that have been a no-ball?"
18.2,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 1 run","that's the first bouncer of the over, or should be! On middle and leg, pulled down to fine leg for a run."
18.1,"Khejroliya to Vinay, 1 run","short and wide outside off, carved away to deep cover. Sundar runs in, and juggles the catch but puts it down. That should have been taken"
17.6,"Woakes to Karthik, no run","full and wide outside off, the ball bounces over Karthik's drive."
17.5,"Woakes to Karthik, FOUR runs",digs it in short again. Karthik is waiting for that and pulls through midwicket for four. Shot.
17.4,"Woakes to Russell, OUT","Russell holes out! A slower delivery outside off, just inside the tramline. Clears his front leg, and skews the ball off the outside half towards long-off. AB runs back and to his right from mid-off. McCullum runs in from long-on. McCullum will never let the ball go. Nor will AB. They almost collide. But AB takes a good catch eventually."
17.3,"Woakes to Russell, no run","a slower ball outside off, Russell is through the shot too early, toe-ends the ball back to the bowler."
17.3,"Woakes to Russell, 1 wide","called A WIDE! AND ONE BOUNCER! A short delivery on off, loops over Russell's head."
17.2,"Woakes to Russell, no run","short and wide, Russell backs away, then goes back into the line. But the ball is well executed, just inside the tramline."
17.1,"Woakes to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length around middle, worked to square leg. Clever from Karthik."
16.6,"Yadav to Russell, SIX runs","DRE RUSS! In the slot from Umesh and Russell goes over long-on. In his wheelhouse, he clears his front leg and makes room for that shot. And then executes, way over long-on. Terrific shot."
16.5,"Yadav to Russell, FOUR runs","full delivery around middle and leg, Russell backs away and chips the ball over mid-off."
16.4,"Yadav to Russell, no run","ANOTHER BOUNCER! Just under the shoulder, deems the square leg umpire. It's another short delivery that hurries Russell through the shot. Beaten"
16.3,"Yadav to Russell, no run","excellently bowled. That has to be one bouncer for the over? IT IS. The first one I've seen today. Follows Russell, just beaten"
16.3,"Yadav to Russell, 1 wide","short delivery down leg, 126 kph, slips down leg, called a wide."
16.2,"Yadav to Russell, no run","another short delivery, this is under the shoulder though. Russell misses an upper cut."
16.1,"Yadav to Russell, FOUR runs","Dre Russ clears his front leg and swats the ball over mid-on. Disdainful, Dre Russ-type heave."
15.6,"Woakes to Russell, 1 run","full and wide outside off, 140 kph. Russell clears his front leg and smashes the ball to deep cover."
15.5,"Woakes to Russell, no run","full outside off, pushed away to cover. His feet are nowhere."
15.4,"Woakes to Singh, OUT","the third bouncer of the over? It's short again, goes past Rinku's pull again. Kohli thinks there is a definite edge on the pull. So he chooses to review. That is definitely at least the second bouncer of the over? RCB keep bowling bouncers and keep getting away with it, not their fault if the umpires are not calling them, obviously. Replays indicate there is an edge on that, so Rinku will have to go. He should have got at least one no-ball this over, though. I've not seen a single one-bouncer signal from an umpire today."
15.3,"Woakes to Singh, no run","another bouncer! Short on middle and leg, through Rinku's pull. Should that have been the second bouncer of the over?"
15.3,"Woakes to Singh, 1 wide","well bowled. Full and wide outside off, the ball angles away, but it is inside the tramline. Called a wide. Another wrong call from the umpire."
15.2,"Woakes to Singh, no run","a good short ball, around middle and leg. The ball is just over the shoulder. Left alone."
15.1,"Woakes to Singh, FOUR runs",Rinku backs away and toe-ends the ball over mid-on. Gave himself some room and went boom. Off the toe end so the ball trickles into the boundary.
14.6,"Sundar to Singh, 1 run","quick on the pads, nudged down to fine leg fore one."
14.5,"Sundar to Karthik, 1 run","slow outside off, Karthik opens the bat face and guides the ball to point for one. An under-rated shot, using the face to hit the ball square on the off side."
14.4,"Sundar to Singh, 1 run","flat on middle, a thick inside edge to square leg for one. almost went through."
14.3,"Sundar to Rana, OUT","and given! LBW. But Rana wants to review. That was the drifter. Sliding in through the air, pitches in front of middle and hits him in front of middle. That's relatively plumb. He missed a big sweep that he attempted, the ball was too full to play that stroke. No bat on that. Two reds and juuuust clipping the side of leg stump. A smile on umpire Shamsuddin's face. That was close."
14.2,"Sundar to Rana, SIX runs","gets to the pitch, doesn't get too close, but gets underneath. Enough of getting. He then executes. Drilled over the bowler's head for six. Straight. Superb hit."
14.1,"Sundar to Karthik, 1 run","nicely bowled, some flight around off, swept down to short fine leg for one."
13.6,"Chahal to Karthik, 1 run","lots of flight outside off, driven away to long-off for a run."
13.5,"Chahal to Karthik, no run","slow outside off, driven with the open face to point"
13.4,"Chahal to Karthik, 2 runs","the flat one on the pads, worked away to deep square leg"
13.3,"Chahal to Karthik, FOUR runs","80 kph, loads of flight yet again. That ball has worked previously but it's definitely not working today. Full and wide and slow. Smashed through cover for four. Running out of options?"
13.2,"Chahal to Karthik, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, the ball is too wide and Karthik scythes it away through point. Easily put away. Chahal's slow, wide delivery has become predictable"
13.1,"Chahal to Rana, 1 run","flight outside off, Rana looks to drive the ball through cover but mis-times the ball to long-off instead."
12.6,"Khejroliya to Karthik, no run","that's a good bouncer! 141 kph, short around off, first bouncer of the over, he used that well. Hurries past Karthik's pull"
12.5,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 2 runs","141 kph, back of a length down leg, off the glove or handle of the bat, down to fine leg. Karthik races back for two and makes it with a dive."
12.5,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 1 wide","short and drifts down leg, another wide. Free runs."
12.5,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 1 wide","drifts down leg, WIDE!"
12.4,"Khejroliya to Rana, 1 leg bye","135 kph, that's close? Was there some bat? A low full toss on leg, Rana misses the flick, the ball takes the pad en route to fine leg. If there was no bat, that should have been out."
12.3,"Khejroliya to Rana, no run","a nice slower ball around off, dips late, driven back to the bowler."
12.2,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 1 run","short around off, pulled to deep square leg, along the ground, rolling his wrists on that."
12.1,"Khejroliya to Rana, 1 run","on the pads, worked away to deep square leg for a run."
11.6,"Chahal to Karthik, no run","should have been wide again! Slow and wide outside off, Karthik missed his lofted drive but the ball spun past the tramline. That's two runs KKR should have got."
11.5,"Chahal to Karthik, no run","the flipper. Short, but very quick. A thick inside edge into the pad, Karthik didn't quite pick the length of that."
11.4,"Chahal to Karthik, no run","again, too predicable, the wide legbreak. Outside the tramline, should have been wide."
11.3,"Chahal to Rana, 1 run","the googly outside off, cut to deep point for a run"
11.2,"Chahal to Rana, 2 runs","a shortish delivery around off, Rana goes back and pulls to deep midwicket for a couple. Played that along the ground."
11.2,"Chahal to Rana, 1 wide","the googly outside off, that's a very predictable delivery now from Chahal. Left alone, wide."
11.1,"Chahal to Karthik, 1 run","short outside off, Karthik goes back and pulls to long-on for a run."
10.6,"Sundar to Karthik, 1 run","slow around off, nudged away towards midwicket for one. Another tidy over from KKR, they're doing this very very nicely."
10.5,"Sundar to Karthik, FOUR runs","very nicely played. A low full toss outside off, driven away through cover. He's kept to Sundar for so long, he knows what's coming. And finds the gap."
10.4,"Sundar to Rana, 1 run","slow outside off, carved towards third man for a run."
10.3,"Sundar to Rana, no run","flat around off, Rana misses his sweep and is struck on the body"
10.2,"Sundar to Rana, 2 runs","nicely hit. Slow outside off, chipped away over cover for a couple. Very neatly played"
10.1,"Sundar to Karthik, 1 run","slow on middle and leg, a thick inside edge towards short fine leg for a run."
9.6,"Yadav to Rana, no run","shortish and wide outside off, Rana's feet aren't moving much. The ball goes past"
9.5,"Yadav to Rana, no run","that may be the first bouncer of the over? Another bouncer on middle and leg, Rana gets underneath that too. Lots of bouncers from RCB."
9.4,"Yadav to Rana, no run","130 kph, short around off, the ball is just below the shoulder as Rana lets that go the keeper"
9.3,"Yadav to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length outside off, 143 kph, nudged down to third man for a run"
9.2,"Yadav to Rana, 1 run","good length outside off, guided away to third man for a run"
9.1,"Yadav to Rana, FOUR runs","what a shot that is. He knows mid-on was up so he opened the bat face and checked the lofted drive over mid-on. Ab does not give up on the ball, runs back and almost gets there eventually. But the ball plonks one arm beyond him and trickled away"
8.6,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 2 runs","back of a length down leg, nudged towards backward square leg for a couple, very neatly played by Karthik."
8.6,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 1 wide","131 kph, another short ball, the second in succession. This is way over the head. Was the previous one the first bouncer of the over? If so, this should have been a no-ball and not a wide. Karthik gets underneath and lets that one go"
8.5,"Khejroliya to Karthik, no run","good bouncer, good leave. Back of a length around off, Karthik lets that one go through, dropping his hands to let that one go."
8.4,"Khejroliya to Rana, 1 run",a high full toss but under the waist. 128 kph. Defended to cover for one. Just under the waist.
8.3,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 1 leg bye","short, around off, Karthik misses a pull as he looks to pull, off the thigh pad to third man."
8.2,"Khejroliya to Rana, 1 run","short of long-on. Back of a length around off, pulled with terrible timing to long-on. Why are there so many shots?"
8.1,"Khejroliya to Karthik, 1 run","again, the wrong shot, I think. Short and wide outside off, DK sees a big gap at midwicket so he goes back and pulls wide of mid-on. A good stop from Sarfraz, running to his right."
7.6,"Yadav to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg for one"
7.5,"Yadav to Karthik, no run","short outside off, Karthik lets hist first ball as KKR captain go to the keeper."
7.4,"Yadav to Rana, 1 run","back of a length down leg, nudged down to fine leg for a run"
7.3,"Yadav to Uthappa, OUT","McCullum takes the catch at backward point. It's a bad shot, short and wide, the ball moving away, Uthappa looks to swat the ball over midwicket but it's the wrong shot. A cut would have been a better shot. But he chose the pull and to add to that, he's hurries on the shot. So the ball takes the splice and lobs up."
7.2,"Yadav to Rana, 1 run","well played. Short outside off, lets the ball come to him before guiding it down to third man. He's allowed that pressure off with some brave shots in the previous over."
7.1,"Yadav to Uthappa, 1 run","back of a length on middle, worked to deep square leg for a run."
6.6,"Khejroliya to Uthappa, 1 run","well bowled. A full delivery on off, some shape inside. Driven to long-on"
6.5,"Khejroliya to Rana, 1 run","a short and wide delivery outside off, chopped away towards cover. Kohli gets in front of Chahal exuberantly and concedes an extra run as the ball goes through them both."
6.4,"Khejroliya to Rana, FOUR runs","full and wide, a poor ball. Slashed over backward point with fierce power. A brief counter-attack and KKR back in front."
6.3,"Khejroliya to Rana, SIX runs","picks the length and goes from bottom to top on his pull, in an attempt to get underneath the ball and hit it for six. He does that excellently well."
6.2,"Khejroliya to Uthappa, 1 run","goes short, down leg, pulled to fine leg for a run."
6.1,"Khejroliya to Uthappa, no run","back of a length down leg, off the pad into the off side. There's an optimistic appeal, pitched well outside leg? It pitched in line, but umpire's call on clipping leg."
5.6,"Yadav to Uthappa, 1 run","good end from both parties. Back of a length outside off, guided down to third man for a single."
5.5,"Yadav to Uthappa, no run","back of a length outside off, plenty of zip and climb as the ball flies past the outside edge"
5.4,"Yadav to Rana, 1 leg bye","struck on the helmet! Is that the second bouncer of the over? No? Off the helmet towards third man, a good stop from the fielder. But that's surely the second delivery over the shoulder of the over? Only one allowed per over in T20s? Rana is not close to his pull by the time the ball pings off the helmet."
5.4,"Yadav to Rana, 1 wide","good stop from de Kock. 125 kph, a loopy tennis-ball bouncer over the head of Rana."
5.3,"Yadav to Rana, no run","that's a fine start. Back of a length around off, Rana is hurried for pace, the ball beats his tentative poke."
5.2,"Yadav to Narine, OUT","Umesh strikes! A thick inside edge into off stump. A low full toss outside off, Narine is clearly harried for pace. He looks to drive the ball but he is very late on the shot, a thick inside edge hits off stump and RCB have some relief. A job extremely well done from Narine. He is the only player with two fifties off 17 balls or lesser in IPL."
5.1,"Yadav to Narine, no run","beaten for pace. 136 kph, full outside off, Narine is not anywhere near the drive."
4.6,"Sundar to Narine, 1 run","a 17-ball 50 for Narine. The last times these two sides met, Narine had hit a 15-ball fifty. Runs down to the ball and skews a lofted drive to deep midwicket to get there. Two fifties by an opener inside the Powerplay today, in both games."
4.5,"Sundar to Narine, SIX runs","six more! The foot is on the boundary as he takes the catch. Full down leg, did Mandeep misjudge that slightly? There's some flight on leg, lofted away to deep midwicket. Mandeep takes the catch inside the boundary, but his foot, body, even the ball has touched the boundary. But umpire Shamsuddin's (inexplicable, I may add) soft signal is out. His decision is quickly overturned by the third umpire."
4.4,"Sundar to Narine, SIX runs","this ain't no pinch-hitter. It's a naught full toss and Narine doesn't cross bat swat it away, or heave. He lofts the ball over mid-off because the fielder is inside the circle. Sensational ball-striking."
4.4,"Sundar to Narine, 1 wide","Narine does the bowler in the mind this time. Backs away, then does not. The ball is down leg. Wide."
4.3,"Sundar to Narine, FOUR runs","finds the gap to mid-off's left this time. Flat and quick, drilled away with immense power."
4.2,"Sundar to Narine, no run","104 kph, Narine clears his front leg, gives himself some room and drills a drive to mid-off"
4.1,"Sundar to Uthappa, 1 run","very full outside off, driven to mid-off"
3.6,"Woakes to Narine, SIX runs","another offcutter, but he drags it down and it ends up as a half-tracker to swat away like a mischievous fly over midwicket. When it comes to roles for T20 sides, does Narine do it better than everyone else?"
3.5,"Woakes to Narine, no run","short around off, Narine looks to cut over the infield but can't make contact."
3.4,"Woakes to Narine, FOUR runs","Kohli chooses to chase the ball instead of cut the angle off wide a dive, and concedes some runs. Full and wide, not the greatest of timing on that drive, but he finds the gap to Kohli's right at cover. And gets four for a lapse in judgement from Kohli."
3.3,"Woakes to Narine, FOUR runs","just over cover and four more. Another very vital Narine cameo. Back of a length on middle, Narine clears his front leg and chips the ball over the fielder"
3.2,"Woakes to Narine, SIX runs",a slower ball is in Narine's wheelhouse. Narine clears his front leg and heaves the ball away for long-on. Massive timing.
3.1,"Woakes to Narine, no run","a short and wide delivery outside off, maybe fifth-stump channel so not too wide. Narine is beaten for bounce as he looks to cut."
2.6,"Sundar to Uthappa, SIX runs","lovely shot. Waits for that flight to dip and not turn. Uthappa then swats the sweep over long-on with sublime timing, it was close to a cross bat but the power and timing was excellent."
2.5,"Sundar to Narine, 1 run","a low full toss outside off, driven away to mid-off for a run"
2.4,"Sundar to Uthappa, 1 run","105 kph, flat outside off, swept down to long-on again."
2.3,"Sundar to Narine, 1 run","the drifter! Full on middle, keeps coming in, takes the inside edge of a big heave, away towards square leg"
2.2,"Sundar to Uthappa, 1 run","looking for the big sweep, flat around off, he improvises a push to long-on"
2.1,"Sundar to Uthappa, no run","a low full toss outside off, driven to mid-off"
1.6,"Woakes to Narine, no run","a low full toss on middle, pushed to mid-on"
1.5,"Woakes to Lynn, OUT","de Villiers takes Lynn! A nice catch. A short, wide delivery outside off. Lynn is too far away from the ball to make adequate contact. All he can do is chip the ball away over cover. But there is enough airtime for AB to run to his left and backwards, his eyes peeled on the ball right through its trajectory and completes the play. Good bowling from Woakes too to bowl that wider"
1.4,"Woakes to Lynn, FOUR runs","a thick inside edge for four. Full and wide outside off, the ball seams back in. Misses the stumps and misses the fine leg fielder."
1.3,"Woakes to Lynn, no run","beaten again. Short and wide outside off, the ball bounces a touch extra too and goes over the bat of Lynn."
1.2,"Woakes to Lynn, no run","full and wide outside off, the ball swinging away. The ball goes past Lynn's hard drive. There won't be many easy catches with this form of batting."
1.1,"Woakes to Lynn, no run","just short of the bowler? Did it carry? Full outside off, driven back to the bowler. Woakes dives low in front, the ball goes through."
0.6,"Chahal to Lynn, 1 run","drifts down leg, worked away to short fine leg for a run."
0.5,"Chahal to Lynn, no run","the flipper. Lynn does not mistake the flipper for a short delivery, blocked back."
0.4,"Chahal to Lynn, no run","some flight on middle and leg, pushed to mid-off with the spin"
0.3,"Chahal to Narine, 1 run","flat outside off, pushed to cover for one. Sensible from Narine, batting like a batsman."
0.2,"Chahal to Narine, SIX runs",Narine gets low and sweeps Chahal for six through midwicket with more power. This is spin into Narine's arc. Right in the slot.
0.1,"Chahal to Narine, FOUR runs","Narine starts with a sweep that goes over the bowler's head, immense power. A flat-batted smash."
19.6,"Vinay to Woakes, OUT","a nice slower ball and Russell will take the catch! Two wickets in two balls to finish the over. Woakes is through the shot too early, the ball takes the lower half of the bat and lobs to cover. Russell runs back and takes a good catch."
19.5,"Vinay to Mandeep, OUT","taken on the deep sweeper cover boundary. Full and wide, Mandeep slices the ball off the outside half to the fielder. Just a little more power and that would have been another six. A very tidy cameo from Mandeep, the impetus is now there."
19.4,"Vinay to Mandeep, no run","indeed, yes, a wide yorker outside off. Jammed back to the bowler. Vinay hurls a throw back to Mandeep in utter frustration."
19.3,"Vinay to Mandeep, SIX runs","six more! Back of a length around off, Mandeep clears his front leg and pulls easily over midwicket. Right in the slot. That's poor end-overs bowling."
19.2,"Vinay to Mandeep, FOUR runs","four more. A low full toss down leg, Mandeep helps himself to four more runs with a neat flick over short fine leg. Can't bowl a full toss at this stage."
19.1,"Vinay to Mandeep, SIX runs","full on middle and leg, Mandeep clears his front leg and goes boom, way over long-on for six. Shot."
18.6,"Johnson to Mandeep, 1 run","falls short of fine leg. A short delivery down leg, pulled away with bad timing to short fine leg."
18.5,"Johnson to Woakes, 1 run","back of a length outside off again, carved away to deep backward point. Just one. Losing all momentum."
18.4,"Johnson to Woakes, no run","beaten for pace! Back of a length on off, the angle and the pace is too good for Woakes as the ball creeps between bat and pad."
18.3,"Johnson to Woakes, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off, Woakes opens the bat face and carves the ball through point for four. Sensational ball-striking, knew his area, didn't overhit."
18.2,"Johnson to Woakes, no run","back of a length around off, the ball beats the bat as Woakes looks to defend."
18.1,"Johnson to Khan, OUT","taken at long-on! Sarfraz picks out the fielder. That was a stumbling, stalling innings. Full outside off, Sarfraz mis-times a lofted drive down the throat of long-on. Kohli isn't happy Sarfraz didn't go through with the shot."
17.6,"Narine to Khan, 1 leg bye","big appeal from Dinesh Karthik! Back of a length around middle and leg, Sarfraz looks to reverse-paddle the ball, the ball hits Sarfraz a little high also, on the front thigh. KKR don't review."
17.5,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","another carrom ball outside off, driven to deep cover for a run"
17.4,"Narine to Mandeep, FOUR runs","fine and four. Another poor delivery, strays down leg, just nudged down to the fine leg boundary. Vital runs these."
17.3,"Narine to Khan, 1 run","a sweep to deep midwicket. A carrom ball, he doesn't even bother reading it, just cross bat."
17.2,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","the swerve of a carrom ball outside off, chopped to cover"
17.1,"Narine to Mandeep, FOUR runs","a poor ball, short and down leg, Mandeep helps it along to the fine leg boundary. Errant line, easy put-away"
16.6,"Johnson to Mandeep, 1 run","again late on the shot. Back of a length on middle, pulled away towards long-on, but on the bounce to the fielder."
16.5,"Johnson to Khan, 1 run","good length around off, defended into the off side for a run."
16.4,"Johnson to Khan, 2 runs","superb fielding from Rinku. A short delivery around middle and leg, pulled away with bad timing towards long-on, who runs to his right and saves two"
16.3,"Johnson to Khan, no run","he's so late on the shot. Back of a length outside off, Sarfraz is not close to the ball as he looks to cut"
16.2,"Johnson to Khan, no run","full and wide outside off, the ball coming in. Guided to backward point. Lots of dots."
16.1,"Johnson to Mandeep, 1 run","full and wide outside off, carved off the open face to third man"
15.6,"Russell to Mandeep, 1 run","full on middle and leg, and Mandeep comfortably turns it off his toes to deep backward square. Time-out once again."
15.5,"Russell to Khan, 1 run",short on off but Sarfraz misses the pull. Bunted to midwicket off the bat's toe end
15.4,"Russell to Mandeep, 1 run","slower ball just outside off, chopped off the back foot to third man"
15.3,"Russell to Khan, 1 run","yorker on middle stump! Sarfraz does well to dig it back straight. Russell tries to get his fingertips to it, and manages to slow the ball down. They scamper across for the run anyway"
15.2,"Russell to Mandeep, 1 run","full ball, and that's been driven past Russell to long on. They walk across for the run"
15.1,"Russell to Mandeep, no run","good length just outside off, pokes at it and taps it to point. Misfield at point makes the batsman contemplate the run. Eventually chooses to come back, but would've been out if the throw was a direct-hit"
14.6,"Rana to Khan, no run","tossed up full outside off, fended back towards the non-striker, and Rana's dive stops the ball. A terrific over for KKR comes to an end"
14.5,"Rana to Mandeep, 1 run","half-tracker on off stump, flicked off his pads to deep midwicket. Played from the back foot"
14.4,"Rana to Mandeep, FOUR runs","swept fine, and it trickles away for a boundary. Full on leg stump, and Mandeep shuffles across to the off side and paddles this to the leg side. Deep backward square loses the chase"
14.3,"Rana to Kohli, OUT","yorked! And he's on a hat-trick. It's a full ball on Kohli's toes, and he can't dig it out. He misses the defense and the ball crashes into middle stump. Rana, you beauty! Takes two in two and KKR are right back in it once again"
14.2,"Rana to AB, OUT","skied! And taken at long on. Another short ball on off, but AB wants to send that into the Ganges river. Tried to muscle this over the leg side, but it's been top edged. Johnson calls for the catch early and takes a swirler. The part-timer has broken the partnership"
14.1,"Rana to AB, SIX runs","half-tracker on off, and that's been pulled over deep midwicket! Just goes deep into his crease and launches this onto the leg side"
13.6,"Russell to AB, 1 run","good length just outside off, AB tries a big leg-side heave but can't connect well. Comes off his bat's toe end, and trickles down to long on. He'll keep strike"
13.5,"Russell to AB, no run","goes short! Pitches on off and jags away from AB. Tries to pull, but he's nowhere near the ball. Through to Karthik from near his face"
13.4,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","good length just outside off, drags his leg-side slog to cow corner this time. They walk across for the single"
13.3,"Russell to AB, 1 run","yorker on off, but manages to squeeze this away to deep midwicket. Late tail into his toes, but well negated by AB"
13.2,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","full just outside off, the drive's not well connected as it's hit to cover"
13.1,"Russell to AB, 1 run","goes short first up. Wide outside off, and chopped on to point. Mis-hit first up"
12.6,"Chawla to AB, 1 run","the googly down leg, nudged to short fine leg."
12.5,"Chawla to Kohli, 1 run","overpitched googly on middle and off, drilled to long-on"
12.4,"Chawla to Kohli, SIX runs","just over midwicket. That's bottom hand, all over. Comes running down and chips the ball into that area. The timing is so good that it clears Johnson, running around."
12.3,"Chawla to Kohli, no run","looking for another big hit but can't connect, hit away with bad timing to midwicket"
12.2,"Chawla to AB, 1 run","don't think he read that googly, around off, a thick inside edge to short fine leg."
12.1,"Chawla to Kohli, 1 run","some flight down leg, flicked away to deep midwicket"
11.6,"Johnson to AB, no run","superb delivery from Johnson. AB premeditated the full delivery so he went across, looking to chip the ball over fine leg. But it's a sharp bouncer aimed at the wide tramline, which means it's extremely well directed."
11.5,"Johnson to AB, no run","a slower offcutter on middle, defended to cover. A very good comeback from Johnson"
11.4,"Johnson to AB, no run","on middle and leg, defended to cover. Finally, a breath"
11.3,"Johnson to AB, SIX runs","Johnson, who? This is tremendous batting. A slower offcutter, AB picks it so early and like he does off the last ball, knows which shot he's going to play, a lofted drive over mid-off with soooo much ease"
11.2,"Johnson to AB, FOUR runs","goes short does Johnson. On middle and leg, and de Villiers nails his pull nicely into the gap towards backward square leg. He picks the areas to score earlier than any other batsmen I've seen"
11.1,"Johnson to AB, no run","under-edged to the keeper? Did it hit the stump? Given out. Back of a length outside off, AB looks to cut the ball down to third man but the ball clips the top of the front pad. That was the big noise. The ball was close to the bat also, but UltraEdge says just pad, not bat. They will have to check for the lbw also. Impact says outside off stump so AB will continue on"
10.6,"Narine to Kohli, 2 runs","flat on middle and off, nudged into the gap at midwicket for a couple. Sensational running, these two make running two look so easy, the fitness these two have is extremely rare to emulate in cricket."
10.5,"Narine to Kohli, FOUR runs","it was his slowest start in T20s (11 off 20), but he breaks his stalling momentum with a lovely chip over cover for four."
10.4,"Narine to AB, 1 run","gives himself lots of room. Narine goes the other way, and AB reaches out for it, taps to cover"
10.3,"Narine to AB, SIX runs","backs away, and Narine follows him. The carrom ball, de Villiers stays low and sweeps over backward square leg. This is one of the best T20 bowlers"
10.2,"Narine to AB, no run","short and turning in, AB misses a flick, struck on the pad"
10.1,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","shortish and wide outside off, chopped to short third man."
9.6,"Kuldeep to AB, SIX runs","there is no one better in cricket at the 1-2. If one is full, he expects the next one short. He did that to Rashid Khan, a bowler that has owned T20s recently. He's done that to Kuldeep, knows that Kuldeep will be slow and full. So he runs down and drills a drive right back. What batting. Awesome"
9.5,"Kuldeep to AB, SIX runs","picks the googly and then lets his hands do the rest. A wide googly, a ball that Kuldeep has owned recently. Lofted so easily over cover"
9.4,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","flat around off, pushed to long-on for one more."
9.3,"Kuldeep to AB, 1 run","some flight on middle again. AB is waiting to read the ball off the pitch, does and pushes to long-on"
9.2,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","a googly on middle, waits for the ball to come to him before turning the ball fine to short third man"
9.1,"Kuldeep to AB, 1 run","slow on middle and off, worked away to deep midwicket for a run"
8.6,"Narine to AB, 1 run","so easy for AB. Short and wide outside off, cut away towards cover who half-stops it. AB wants two but Kohli thinks maybe now now."
8.5,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","short and wide, the carrom ball, cut away to long-off. Think Kohli is just struggling a touch for timing."
8.4,"Narine to Kohli, no run","another dot to Kohli, flat down leg. Kohli misses a flick, struck on the pad."
8.3,"Narine to AB, 1 run","another swervy delivery outside off, AB opens his season with a neat drive to deep cover"
8.2,"Narine to McCullum, OUT","gone through McCullum! A short offbreak, McCullum picks the length early, goes back and looks to hit that over midwicket but he was too early through the shot. The ball goes on and hits middle and off stump."
8.1,"Narine to McCullum, no run","full down leg, 87 kph, blocked"
7.6,"Johnson to Kohli, no run","good change in length, the bouncer and well directed too. Short down leg. Kohli is late on the pull, it just about misses the glove on the way to the keeper."
7.5,"Johnson to McCullum, 1 run","on a length, around off, chopped away towards point. Kohli and McCullum almost collide, other than that, an easy run."
7.4,"Johnson to McCullum, FOUR runs","he's clobbered that with immense power. Runs down, gets close enough to Johnson's offcutter and then smashes the ball over mid-off. Muscular hit."
7.3,"Johnson to McCullum, no run","134 kph, back of a length outside off, carved away towards point again."
7.2,"Johnson to McCullum, FOUR runs","just erred a touch in line and that's in McCullum's wheelhouse. Full and wide, McCullum transfers his weight late and drills the drive through cover for four."
7.1,"Johnson to McCullum, no run","back of a length from around the wicket, dabbed away towards backward point."
6.6,"Narine to Kohli, no run","the floaty swervy delivery outside off, Kohli yorks himself as he defends."
6.5,"Narine to Kohli, no run","94 kph, carved away to point for nothing. Lots of dots in the last 10 or so balls."
6.4,"Narine to McCullum, 1 run","overpitched outside off, pushed away to long-off for a run. These two very happy with playing Narine out."
6.3,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","short around middle and leg, pulled over midwicket for a run. The timing there was horrible."
6.2,"Narine to Kohli, no run","flat and straight, a thick inside edge into the ground"
6.1,"Narine to Kohli, no run",starts with a swervy away carrom ball that is fiercely struck to point
5.6,"Chawla to McCullum, SIX runs","comes down, meets the ball before it pitches and cleanly chips the ball over long-on to round off a successful Powerplay for RCB. Calculated risks, and he's still there. Well played"
5.5,"Chawla to Kohli, 1 run","92 kph, flat outside off, pushed with soft hands towards cover for a run"
5.4,"Chawla to Kohli, no run","looking for the late cut but fails to connect. Short and wide outside off, Kohli misses his dab"
5.3,"Chawla to McCullum, 1 run","they'll get one, short and wide, chopped away towards point. The ball beats the fielder running in."
5.2,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","excellently bowled, fired that in around off, defended back. Five dot balls in a row"
5.1,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","overpitched outside off, McCullum backs away and jams an attempted drive into the ground."
4.6,"Kuldeep to Kohli, no run","three dots to end the over, well bowled. Flat on middle and leg, driven back towards the bowler. Kohli happy to play him out too."
4.5,"Kuldeep to Kohli, no run","wider outside off, flat too, pushed to mid-off from the crease"
4.4,"Kuldeep to Kohli, no run","another wrong 'un around middle and leg, driven to mid-off"
4.3,"Kuldeep to McCullum, 1 run","another googly on middle and leg, nudged to deep midwicket for one. Clever from McCullum."
4.2,"Kuldeep to McCullum, no run","flat outside off, McCullum misses a hard sweep and the ball just misses off stump. But Karthik whips off the bails nice and quickly. But has he got back in time? Yes. That's fine. He's safe."
4.1,"Kuldeep to McCullum, FOUR runs","picked that! And his area. The googly outside off, McCullum chips the ball over mid-off, and gets four."
4.1,"Kuldeep to McCullum, 5 wide","five wides! Down leg and McCullum misses a sweep. Karthik misses his collection too, resulting in five wides."
3.6,"Chawla to McCullum, 1 run","on the pads, worked away down to short fine leg for a run."
3.5,"Chawla to McCullum, FOUR runs","ah, that's too wide. The googly and wide outside off, sliced away through point for four. Picks a slim gap."
3.4,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","another dot! Flat outside off, pushed to cover"
3.3,"Chawla to McCullum, no run","the googly, picks him well. McCullum backs away, reads the googly and defends. Two dots in three balls."
3.2,"Chawla to Kohli, 1 run","overpitched on leg, driven to long-on for a run. Kohli easing himself into this innings, but hardly any dot balls."
3.1,"Chawla to Kohli, no run","some flight outside off, driven to cover from the crease"
2.6,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","on middle and leg, a calm drive to long-on. Seven off the over."
2.5,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 2 runs","terrific shot, good stop too! Some flight and Kohli flicks him with the wrists through midwicket. The long-on fielder dives to his right to save some runs"
2.4,"Kuldeep to McCullum, 1 run","the leading edge, just wide of cover. Lots of flight, the googly. McCullum looks to work the ball into the leg side but the leading edge just evades the diving fielder"
2.3,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","nicely bowled, the line is better, so is the length. It's wider outside off, turning in. But Kohli drives effortlessly to long-on"
2.2,"Kuldeep to McCullum, 1 run","drops it short down leg, worked away to deep square leg for a single"
2.1,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","a flat delivery on leg, worked away to deep midwicket for one"
1.6,"Chawla to Kohli, 1 run","the googly, reads it yesterday. On middle, worked to deep midwicket"
1.5,"Chawla to Kohli, 2 runs","an overpitched delivery on off, worked away to deep midwicket for two. Can't undo Kohli with wristspin easily."
1.4,"Chawla to de Kock, OUT","taken at short third man! Another indicator that de Kock did not read Piyush Chawla. A legbreak on middle and off, de Kock looks for a reverse sweep, takes a thick leading edge and lobs to short third man. Legspin comes with extra revolutions and very very often top edges too."
1.3,"Chawla to de Kock, no run","a fine paddle sweep, slow outside off, a fine tap to short fine leg."
1.2,"Chawla to de Kock, no run","the googly! De Kock does not pick that! The googly outside off, de Kock plays for some legspin but the ball keeps drifting on and beats the bat"
1.1,"Chawla to de Kock, FOUR runs","and then he bowls full and wide outside off, de Kock is welcomed to his new franchise with an overpitched delivery outside off. And de Kock drills a drive through cover to open his RCB account."
0.6,"Vinay to McCullum, FOUR runs",that's tripe from Vinay Kumar. He goes on the pads and McCullum says thanks with a neat flick through backward square leg. Too easy. 14 off 6 for Baz.
0.5,"Vinay to McCullum, no run","there comes the charge. Back of a length on middle and leg, a big swing and miss. Extra bounce"
0.4,"Vinay to McCullum, SIX runs","that's cleared fine leg! A short delivery on middle and leg, McCullum pulls but gets a thick top edge which flies over fine leg. McCullum has 9000 T20 runs too"
0.3,"Vinay to McCullum, no run","nice length on a new pitch. 136 kph, full outside off. McCullum stands in his crease and defends to cover."
0.2,"Vinay to McCullum, no run","better from Vinay Kumar. Full and on a length, defended back"
0.1,"Vinay to McCullum, FOUR runs",what a terrible start from Vinay Kumar. And what a delightful start for Mccullum for his new franchise. On the pads and McCullum tickles this easily behind square for four.

18.1,"Boult to Miller, 1 run",belts this full toss on middle to deep square leg

15.4,"Christian to Nair, OUT","this time he picks the man out at deep midwicket. Another short ball outside off, Nair pulls, hits it very well but found Boult, who did superbly well to move low to his right to take this catch. Look of disbelief on his face as he walks off."
15.3,"Christian to Nair, no run",squeezes this yorker back to the bowler.
15.2,"Christian to Nair, SIX runs","swung away to clear wide long on. That's a 31-ball half-century for Nair. Too short, he picked the length early and walloped this into the stands.

15.1,"Christian to Nair, no run","slips this down leg, Nair looks to help this past short fine but can't lay bat to it. Rolls to the fielder there off the thigh pad."
14.6,"Mishra to Miller, 2 runs","waits for the turn on this googly as he works it to deep midwicket. This was on the shorter side, so Miller had enough time to adjust and play it off the backfoot"

12.5,"Mishra to Nair, 1 run","tossed up on leg stump, worked to deep midwicket"
12.4,"Mishra to Nair, 2 runs","uppish but wide of cover, down to the sweeper. They took a chance with the second and made it because Iyer's throw was wayward."

8.6,"Shami to Nair, no run",flicks this full toss on middle to midwicket

8.1,"Shami to Nair, 1 run",bunts this wide of the keeper as they scamper a quick single. Very risky

5.2,"Morris to Nair, no run",shows the full face of the bat and defends this length ball back
5.1,"Morris to Nair, FOUR runs","full and straight on the stumps from wide of the crease, Karun is standing deep inside the crease and so has enough time to bring his wrists into play to put this into the gap at midwicket. Lovely timing."
4.6,"Boult to Yuvraj, no run","ripper of a yorker, superb from Boult, Yuvraj just about manages to get his bat down in time to keep it out."
4.5,"Boult to Rahul, OUT","the party is over. Shami takes an excellent catch running backwards at short third man. This is a full toss that angles away, Rahul looks to cleverly whip this behind square but ends up getting a leading edge. Shami called early, made ground and was in total control as it descended. Rahul has done his job though."
4.4,"Boult to Yuvraj, 1 run","full and straight on the stumps, squeezed down to long on"
4.3,"Boult to Yuvraj, no run","mistimes this pull to midwicket. This was a touch too full, was in no position to play the stroke."

3.6,"Morris to Yuvraj, 1 run",steers this slower length ball down to square third man
3.5,"Morris to Yuvraj, no run","scintillating straight drive, but a little too straight. Smashes into the stumps at the bowler's end."

3.3,"Morris to Yuvraj, no run","starts off with a short ball on middle, Yuvraj ducks under this one"
3.2,"Morris to Agarwal, OUT","drills this straight to mid on. Agarwal checked his shot, not sure why, and has to go as Shami takes a comfortable catch."
3.1,"Morris to Agarwal, SIX runs","joins the party as he slams this length delivery over extra cover. Sailed over the ropes. Made room and used his forearm power to loft this. Woah, sensational."
2.6,"Mishra to Rahul, no run",tries to cut a short one and loses shape due to lack of room and gets beaten
2.5,"Mishra to Rahul, FOUR runs","fastest IPL fifty. KL Rahul, take a bow! A fuller one and Rahul comes down the track and meets the pitch before driving down the pitch to long-on"
2.4,"Mishra to Rahul, FOUR runs","short again, this is tripe from Mishra. Line, length, all no good. Short and no turn and Rahul pulls it away to midwicket"
2.3,"Mishra to Rahul, SIX runs",Mishra slides one into the pads now and Rahul gets down for a sweep and top-edges it to deep fine leg as he falls over
2.2,"Mishra to Rahul, SIX runs","oh, dear! What short of a delivery is that! Mishra drops it short and Rahul backs away and carts it over long-off. Slapped away"
2.1,"Mishra to Rahul, FOUR runs",shot! Rahul producing a masterclass here. Advances down the ground to a loopy one and splits cover and extra cover with a neat drive
1.6,"Shami to Agarwal, no run","short of a length on off, punched down to mid-on, and a bit of miscommunication on the single. Rahul wants it and is sent back. Rahul puts in the dive and hurts his shoulder. Clutches it. Could have been the ball hitting him."
1.5,"Shami to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, jumps and runs it down to third man with an open face"
1.4,"Shami to Rahul, FOUR runs","short of a length outside off, Rahul doesn't entirely get behind the line this time and doesn't middle it. Whipped away off the inside of the bat through square leg"
1.3,"Shami to Rahul, SIX runs","six more. Shami bangs it in and angles it in around middle and leg, and Rahul gets the angle he's looking for to swivel and smoke it over fine leg"
1.2,"Shami to Agarwal, 1 run","good length around middle, flicked between midwicket and square leg"
1.1,"Shami to Agarwal, no run","length ball that slides on middle, flicked to midwicket"
0.6,"Boult to Rahul, FOUR runs","make that a hat-trick of fours. Too much width on offer outside off, and that's Rahul's cue to open up his arms and shovel it through sweeper cover"
0.5,"Boult to Rahul, FOUR runs","short of a length, angled across, Rahul gets the front leg out and punches it through extra cover"
0.4,"Boult to Rahul, SIX runs",a top-edged six. That's an outrageous six. Rahul simply swiped at a short of a length ball around leg stump and had zero room. Just carries all the way over fine leg
0.3,"Boult to Rahul, no run",elegantly punches a fullish delivery with a straight bat but straight to mid-off
0.2,"Boult to Rahul, 2 runs","short of a length, pitching outside leg, tucked off the pads to midwicket"
0.1,"Boult to Rahul, no run","fuller outside off, Rahul drills down the pitch"
19.6,"Sharma to Christian, OUT","full, straight and the off stump has been flattened. This one reversed in late to beat the swing. Christian went for the glory hit but couldn't get under the length. Superb delivery. Outstanding stuff."
19.5,"Sharma to Morris, 3 runs","mistimes a hoick, Tye runs to his right at deep midwicket and stops it with a sliding tackle, ends up deflecting it off his boot to Stoinis. Saved a couple of runs"
19.4,"Sharma to Morris, FOUR runs","flat-batted pull that just eludes Tye, who was running around from deep midwicket. Hits the advertising triangle on the bounce.16 deliverie"

19.1,"Sharma to Morris, 1 run",pulled from outside off towards deep square leg
18.6,"Tye to Christian, SIX runs",muscled over long on. He had the free license. Used the depth of the crease to convert this full delivery into a nice half-volley as he teed off in style. Brings up the 150 as well.
18.6,"Tye to Christian, (no ball)","surely that's one warning for a beamer. This perhaps slipped out as he tried a back-of-the-hand slower ball. Had the batsman on the floor, Rahul scampers to his left to stop that."
18.5,"Tye to Christian, no run",makes room to carve this behind point but Tye bowls this full and straight outside off. Beaten
18.4,"Tye to Morris, 1 run",slaps this full delivery outside off towards long off
18.3,"Tye to Christian, 1 run","looks to swing over midwicket, but mistimes this waist-high full toss down the ground.  Morris has a quizzical look on his face "
18.2,"Tye to Morris, 1 run","can't get the elevation as he looks to drill down to long-on, straight to the fielder."
18.1,"Tye to Christian, 1 leg bye","good work by KL Rahul, moved swiftly to his left to stop what could've been a four down leg. This deflected off the pad as he looked to step out and whip it square"
17.6,"Mujeeb to Christian, 1 run",goes across the stumps and works this to deep square leg. That's a day's pay well earned. Superb spell
17.5,"Mujeeb to Morris, 1 run","this one spins away from off stump, eased to long off"
17.4,"Mujeeb to Morris, 2 runs","just a gentle little push down to long-on, shouldn't have been two. Very easily done"

16.6,"Sharma to Morris, 1 run",punches this length delivery to cover
16.5,"Sharma to Morris, SIX runs",he's clobbered this and it sails over long on. Steps out and swings this length delivery up and over. Held his pose for the cameras as well. Clean striking right out of the top drawer
16.4,"Sharma to Christian, 1 run","punches this length delivery to cover, a direct hit at the bowler's end and it would've been interesting."
16.3,"Sharma to Morris, 1 run",slower length ball on off stump - back-of-the-hand stuff - worked behind square towards short fine leg.
16.2,"Sharma to Christian, 1 run","full delivery that tails away a hint from off stump, driven to deep cover"

15.4,"Ashwin to Christian, 1 run",squeezes the drive to point for a quick single
15.3,"Ashwin to Tewatia, OUT","one switch hit too many and is gone. This is not the most intelligent piece of cricket from Tewatia. Ashwin outfoxes him by getting to drift in, spin away just a wee bit to hit him on the box as he swung through. As plumb as decisions can get."
15.2,"Ashwin to Morris, 1 run","legbreak on the pads, turned to long on"
15.1,"Ashwin to Tewatia, 1 run","full on middle and leg, eased to long on"
14.6,"Tye to Tewatia, OUT"," direct hit and Gambhir's bat is on the line.  Would've been even through an inkling of a dive. Gambhir was lazily ambling down the surface and has paid the price. Coming back to the delivery, this was clipped straight to short fine leg. Nevertheless, this has been an excellent innings from Gambhir. Weathered the early storm and set them up for a strong finish. Mujeeb continues to have a field day"
14.5,"Tye to Gambhir, 1 run","full on the pads, whipped over the infield, on the bounce to deep square leg"
14.4,"Tye to Tewatia, 1 run","chipped over the infield, no one at cover. Single taken"

14.1,"Tye to Gambhir, 1 run","looks to scoop this fine but is off balance, gets it high on the bat but this lands short of Mujeeb at short fine leg.  Mujeeb picked it late and was late to move forward "
13.6,"Mujeeb to Tewatia, 2 runs","prods outside the line, gets a thick inside edge towards deep midwicket"
13.5,"Mujeeb to Tewatia, FOUR runs","the switch hit over backward point. Has done effectively what Munro didn't. First ball, sighters anyone? No, boss. Not needed. What a hit"

13.3,"Mujeeb to Gambhir, no run",bunts this back towards the bowler.
13.2,"Mujeeb to Pant, OUT","hje's misread the googly and has paid the price! Steps out to hoick this into the leg side but doesn't quite get to the pitch and slices this to cover where Tye was running backwards from the infield, wasn't in balance but somehow managed to hold on to the swirler. Superb catch. Mujeeb's superb initiation into the IPL continues."
13.1,"Mujeeb to Pant, FOUR runs","drilled past the bowler, beats long on. Solid hit. Got to the pitch and hammered it. Pant is in top form, batting as if he was netting somewhere before coming in"
12.6,"Tye to Pant, 1 run","yorker-length on off stump, squeezed to long off"
12.5,"Tye to Pant, FOUR runs","too short, Pant helps him over short fine. Cleverly done. This was a slower ball gone wrong."

12.3,"Tye to Pant, 1 run",slaps this away-going length ball to deep cover
12.2,"Tye to Pant, SIX runs","this is hammered deep into the stands at deep midwicket. This is the kind of game he struggled to bring to the fore when he was playing for India. This is a length ball, Pant was waiting for it as he muscled it away. Too much power off the bottom hand."
12.1,"Tye to Pant, FOUR runs","hoicked from outside off, gets this one bounce into the ropes at deep square leg. Dragged this a long way, lucky to get away with it."
11.6,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run",swept away towards deep midwicket as they jog the single
11.5,"Ashwin to Gambhir, 1 run",gentle little dab into the off side for a quick single.  36th IPL fifty.  Equals Warner's record for most half-centuries in the competition
11.4,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run"," run out missed at the bowler's end by KL Rahul.  Big mix-up. Pant looks to hoick but misses, hits the pad and deflects behind the stumps. He wanted a leg bye but was sent back. The throw at the bowler's end is very, very wide."
11.3,"Ashwin to Gambhir, 1 run","top-edges a slog sweep,  falls in no man's land.  Axar from deep midwicket. Miller from wide long on and neither can get there. For a while,  they were on a collision course "

10.2,"Sharma to Gambhir, 1 run",turns this length ball on middle to mid on.
10.1,"Sharma to Shankar, OUT","comes back and strikes immediately. Vijay looks to pull this short ball but this skids through to beat him for pace, gets elevation on this short-arm jab but can't generate power and long on takes a comfortable catch."
9.6,"Stoinis to Shankar, 1 run","short of a length around off, pulled away to square leg"
9.5,"Stoinis to Shankar, 2 runs","full toss on middle and leg, whipped away between long-on and deep midwicket, the latter gets around it"

8.6,"Axar Patel to Gambhir, no run","steps out to whip, got into a tangle as he played early because Axar slowed it down. Hit on the pad, manages to get back into the crease."
8.5,"Axar Patel to Gambhir, FOUR runs","paddled over short fine. Not entirely in control, it looked like, but it flew over the infield. Axar once again punished for firing it in. Hasn't learnt."
8.4,"Axar Patel to Shankar, 1 run",gets a thick inside edge on a hoick to deep midwicket
8.3,"Axar Patel to Gambhir, 1 run","sees Gambhir advancing and fires this in, whipped to deep midwicket"

8.1,"Axar Patel to Shankar, 2 runs","cleanly lofted inside out, extremely well done by Miller at long off. Ran a good 15 yards to his left and then dished out a full-length swimming pool dive to cut that off"
7.6,"Ashwin to Shankar, 1 run","punched back, Ashwin can't get across in time to stop it off his own bowling despite doing all the hard work in running to his right, down to long on"
7.5,"Ashwin to Shankar, no run","beauty. This grips and spins away sharply to beat Vijay's outside edge as he looked to work across the line. Delightful legbreak. Drew him forward, got this to bounce. Kumble would've been proud of that."
7.5,"Ashwin to Shankar, 1 wide","legbreak gone wrong, slips this down leg. Vijay sweeps and misses"
7.4,"Ashwin to Gambhir, 1 run","drifts in a quicker delivery on middle and leg, worked towards midwicket"

6.6,"Axar Patel to Shankar, no run",driven straight to extra cover
6.5,"Axar Patel to Iyer, OUT","finally flighted one, got it to turn and has been rewarded. This is much slower through the air, Iyer is drawn forward as he shapes to drive but couldn't get to the pitch. The faint nick has been well taken by Rahul behind the stumps."
6.4,"Axar Patel to Gambhir, 1 run",leading edge but trickles down to long off. Looked to clip this over midwicket
6.3,"Axar Patel to Iyer, 1 run","fired into the pads, turned to deep midwicket"

0.4,"Ashwin to Munro, no run","smart stumping from KL Rahul. Munro beaten by sharp turn. Excellent change of pace from Ashwin. Munro has no clue about this as he jabs at the delivery.

19.5,"Mustafizur to Jadhav, FOUR runs","CSK mark their return with a stunning win! Overpitched and outside off, Mustafizur loses his length, Jadhav leans back, uses the depth of the crease, and belts it through the covers. Cracking finish from Bravo and Jadhav"
19.4,"Mustafizur to Jadhav, SIX runs","Jadhav shovels it all the way over short fine leg for a six. WHAT A CRAZY SHOT. Jadhav, you beauty. He shuffles across off, drops down to one knee - injured hamstring and all - and ramps it all the way to the boundary. He might not have ventured this shot had fine leg been back. Is this the game?

18.6,"Bumrah to Bravo, OUT","Bumrah stays round the wicket but shifts his length. Bumrah ventures shorter and wider outside off, Bravo loses his timing and his head. He splices a catch to Rohit at extra cover. Bravo was aiming for the signature loft over extra cover but it got big on him"
